---++ Why interoperate with WLCG?

"The OSG Consortium builds and operates the OSG. The Consortium was formed in 2004 to bring resources and researchers from universities and national laboratories together to give scientists from many fields access to shared resources worldwide."  (<a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000063">Source</a>)  Interoperation with WLCG will allow scientists access to the OSG shared resources, helping to fulfill one of OSG's goals.

---++ Scope

There are four broadly defined groups or types of interoperability that OSG and WLCG depend on for smooth interoperation.  These are Information Services, Accounting Services, Monitoring (SAM), and Security.

---+++ Information services
   * [[Interoperability.InformationServicesAndWLCG][OSG Information Services And WLCG]] - how WLCG receives OSG Information Services data.
   * [[Interoperability.InfoSysInteropQuestionsAndIssues][Information Services Interoperability Questions, Issues, and Proposals]]

---+++ Computing/Storage services
   * [[OSGComputingStorageAndWLCG][OSG Computing/Storage And WLCG]] - how WLCG and OSG interoperate at the Compute Element and Storage Element level.
   * [[Interoperability.ComputeStorageInteropQuestionsAndIssues][Computing/Storage Interoperability Questions, Issues, and Proposals]]

---+++ Accounting Interoperability
   * [[Interoperability.AccountingAndWLCG][Accounting And WLCG]] - how WLCG receives and utilizes the OSG grid accounting information.
   * [[Interoperability.AccountingInteropQuestionsAndIssues][Accounting Interoperability Questions, Issues, and Proposals]]

---+++ Site Monitoring
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/SiteAvailabilityMonitoringForWLCG][Site Monitoring and WLCG]] - how the WLCG receives and utilizes the OSG monitoring information.
   * [[Interoperability.SiteMonitoringInteropQuestionsAndIssues][Site Monitoring Interoperability Questions, Issues, and Proposals]]

---+++ Security
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/SecurityAndWLCG][Security and WLCG]]
   * [[Interoperability.SecurityInteropQuestionsAndIssues][Security Interoperability Questions, Issues, and Proposals]]

---+++ Miscellaneous Topics
   * What is the process for adding an OSG VO (Not CMS or ATLAS) to the accepted VO list for the WLCG?
