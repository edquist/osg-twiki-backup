---++ Why interoperate with WLCG?
"The OSG Consortium builds and operates the OSG. The Consortium was formed in 2004 to bring resources and researchers from universities and national laboratories together to give scientists from many fields access to shared resources worldwide."  (<a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000063">Source</a>)  Interoperation with WLCG will allow scientists access to the OSG shared resources, helping to fulfill one of OSG's goals.

---++ Scope
There are four broadly defined groups or types of interoperability that OSG and WLCG depend on for smooth interoperation.  These are Information Services, Accounting Services, Monitoring (SAM), and Security.

---+++ Information services
OSG installations have the [[GenericInformationProvider][Generic Information Provider]] (GIP) configured automatically.  The GIP provides information to the [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php][CEMon]] (CEMonitor) service.  CEMon also is configured by default to publish GIP data in "RAW" (LDIF) format to the OSG BDII at the OSG GOC.  The OSG BDII acts as a top level BDII for all of OSG.<p>

The production [[http://is.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi][CEMon/BDII]] page and the ITB [[http://is-itb.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi][CEMon/BDII]] page display the incoming information provided by the GIP via CEMon and the served BDII data.  <p>

The production WLCG information service checks MyOSG for a list of OSG sites that should be included for interoperability.  The OSG BDII is queried regularly to keep the WLCG information current.

---+++ Accounting services
[[Accounting][Gratia]] collects grid accounting information for OSG and provides an interface to publish that information.  

---++++ Accounting Interoperability
