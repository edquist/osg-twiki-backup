---++ Topics of Discussion

---+++ Computing/Storage services 
   * Basic interoperability has been established between current WLCG software and OSG RPM software

   * DigiCert testing
      * some concerns were raised
      * will send email with concerns to the appropriate people

   * Discussed https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/10776
      * the lcg-jobwrapper-hook.sh error is a red herring.  It will almost always error out since it is not used by any major VOs anymore.
      * error is occurring elsewhere

---+++ Questions to raise:
   * Can glite-wms can talk "GRAM5" rather than "GRAM2"?
   * What Java programs/services use jGlobus in WLCG?
      * Since it doesn't support SHA-2, there will be problems once the IGTF CAs move to SHA-2 mid next year
