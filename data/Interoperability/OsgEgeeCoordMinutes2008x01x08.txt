---++ EGEE Items
<ul>
    <li>Web space -- we can read but can't (yet) write. Antonio will investigate. </li>
    <li>gLite validation by Jan 23 - Nick will talk to Andrea Sciaba about using his CMS SAM tests for testing the latest gLite UI/WMS release. If the desired gLite version is deployed on the PPS, Tony is available to do testing by hand as well.</li>
</ul>

---++ OSG Items

---++ Platform
<ul>
    <li> OPS tests on OSG ITB sites - Emanouil had issues with UCSD, Caltech, BNL and filed tickets, problems solved. However only Fermigrid, BNL, and U of Chicago are guaranteed to be responsive, he will limit tests to those three. We'll (BH) clarify the support chain for those ITB sites.
        <ul>
            <li>lcg-cr doesn't work just about anywhere, but it's not supported on OSG. Emanouil will send around his tests so we can see where it breaks and help determine if this is something to support in the future.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Information system - In short/medium term, only plans are to do performance tuning -- current infrastructure will meet EGEE goals. OSG is planning to add attributes outside of the Glue Schema and filtering them out at the OSG BDII; Laurence advises utilizing available free-form fields such as RuntimeEnvironment? (and also mentioned he is always available for questions and advice). - Glue 2.0 draft will get circulated and approved over next few OGFs, OSG should look </li>
</ul>
