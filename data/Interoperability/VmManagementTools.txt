---+ VM Management Tools
---++ Introduction
The wide (and incompatible) variety of virtualization-enabled grids and cloud services call for a set of management tools to provide a single and consistent interface.  These tools, part of the ExTENCI project, aim to automate some of the more-tiresome aspects of using multiple clouds and VEGgies.  Intended for a single user, the core of these tools is a common catalog of information about the services that user can access (including image storage services), the corresponding identification or authorization information, and the user's virtual machines.
---++ Overview of Functionality
In this prototyping release, the tools only support the EC2 and S3 cloud protocols (and have only been tested against Amazon's implementation thereof).  They're primarily intended to automate the process of testing a new VM image, starting with an image on the local disk and ending with it running on the user's chosen service.  The tool which accomplishes this is called =extenci-test-vm=.  Everything that it does can be duplicated by calling one of =extenci-catalog=, which manipulates the common catalog; =extenci-stage=, which uploads images; or =extenci-control=, which uses Condor to start and stop instances of an image.
---++ Limitations and Preparations
The =euca2ools= must be in your PATH in order to run these tools.  Likewise, a Condor installation with a configured EC2_GAHP must be available, and the corresponding command-line tools (=condor_submit=, =condor_q=, and =condor_rm=) in your PATH.  (The Condor installation may be a "personal Condor", which requires no privileges.)

The tools expect a (partially) populated =~/.extenci= directory, and the download includes one to get you started.  In particular, if you have an account with Amazon Web Services, populate =.extenci/catalog/service/Amazon=.  You add some other EC2/S3 service by copying =Amazon= to whatever name you find appropriate, and changing the filenames therein appropriately.  (For consistency, and to avoid having authentication information in the environment, the user ID, access key, and secret key issued to you by Amazon (or whoever) are all kept in individual files on disk, rather than listed directly in the catalog.)
