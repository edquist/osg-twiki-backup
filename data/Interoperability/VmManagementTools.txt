---+ VM Management Tools
---++ Introduction
The wide (and incompatible) variety of virtualization-enabled grids and cloud services call for a set of management tools to provide a single and consistent interface.  These tools, part of the [[https://sites.google.com/site/extenci/][ExTENCI]] project, aim to automate some of the more-tiresome aspects of using multiple clouds and VEGgies.  Intended for a single user, the core of these tools is a common catalog of information about the services that user can access (including image storage services), the corresponding identification or authorization information, and the user's virtual machines.
---++ Overview of Functionality
In this prototyping release, the tools only support the EC2 and S3 cloud protocols (and have only been tested against Amazon's implementation thereof).  They're primarily intended to automate the process of testing a new VM image, starting with an image on the local disk and ending with it running on the user's chosen service.  The tool which accomplishes this is called =extenci-test-vm=.  Everything that it does can be duplicated by calling one of =extenci-catalog=, which manipulates the common catalog; =extenci-stage=, which uploads images; or =extenci-control=, which uses Condor to start and stop instances of an image.  This functionality can also be accessed through the tools' library API.
---++ Limitations and Preparations
   1. The [[http://open.eucalyptus.com/downloads][euca2ools]] must be in your PATH in order to run these tools.
   2. The [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor][Condor]] tools =condor_submit=, =condor_q=, and =condor_rm= must be in your PATH and configured to use a Condor with the EC2 Grid Universe, which implies version 7.7.0 or later; the tools will work the "personal" Condor you can install as an unprivileged user.
   3. The tools need certain files in the =~/.extenci= directory to get started (until I write a better service discovery mechanism).  The download includes an example =~/.extenci= directory to help you get started; you'll need to fill in the information in =~/.extenci/catalog/service/Amazon= appropriately.  Note that no security information is stored in the catalog itself; instead, everything is stored in files on disk.  (This is conventional for your private and public keys, but not for your Amazon user ID, access key ID, or secret access key.)  The tools should work with other EC2/S3 providers.  To add more, just copy the =Amazon= file to whatever name you want (Wispy?) and adjust the contents accordingly.
   4. At present, the tools only handle "raw"-format virtual machine images.
---++ Usage with Examples
<pre class="screen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% extenci-test-vm vmImageFileName Amazon m1.large</code>
</pre>

This will stage (bundle, upload, and register) the virtual machine image =vmImageFileName= to Amazon, run it as an m1.large instance, tell you its IP, and then wait for you to confirm if it's working properly.  It will terminate the instance when you answer, unstaging the image if you said it wasn't.
