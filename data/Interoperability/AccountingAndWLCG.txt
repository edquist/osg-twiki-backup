---++ Overview
Accounting records collected by Gratia are forwarded to the EGEE accounting system, APEL.    This is important for US-LHC Tier1 and Tier2 facilities which have to demonstrate to the LHC project delivered computing resources on behalf of ATLAS and CMS collaborations, in accordance with signed Memorandum of Understanding agreements.  A service outside the OSG software infrastructure (VDT) runs at Fermilab, parses and analyzes accounting records for a resource, scales wall time figures into SPEC_int2000 for the processor type, and then forwards to an APEL server at the EGEE GOC.

For a more detailed description of the interface, refer to the [[Accounting.GratiaInterfacesApelLcg][OSG Accounting APEL/WLCG interface document]].
