---++ Platform
1. The SAM tests are now run regularly (at least once per day), and results are visible at [[https://gserv3.ipp.acad.bg:8443/sam/sam.py][https://gserv3.ipp.acad.bg:8443/sam/sam.py]]
<pre>
The tests are submitted manually, due to some issues with the oracle connections becoming exhausted.
This is being fixed.
The results will be integrated with the PPS googlemap display.
The UI will be reconfigured to use the PPS install procedure (done).
http://gserv3.ipp.acad.bg:8080/interop/test.html
is updated once per hour with data about status of sites and nodes.
</pre>
<ul>
    <li> No further comments </li>
</ul>

2. Analysis of the results:
<pre>
a. lcg_util now works better than before, but reveals there is a difference in the semantics of GlueSAPath - 
in EGEE we would have GlueSAPath /pnfs/fnal.gov/data/opssgm, while in OSG they have 
only /pnfs/fnal.gov/data and expect the user to guess that he must write only under opssgm. 
Seems to be the same problem for all OSG sites.

In some cases the directory is writable anyways, and lcg_util works, but in other cases it attempts to write 
in places it is not allowed
This is an important point to be discussed.
</pre>
<ul>
    <li> Emanouil has sent an e-mail describing the details of the issue</li>
    <li> Anthony will go through it --> task 23 opened </li>
</ul>
<pre>
b. the tests reveal that the gLite software is not available (not in the PATH) in the worker nodes - 
see how commands like lcg-cr or glite-brokerinfo are not found.
To be investigated by Andreas Unterkircher.

c. One SRM SE now works with SRM copy - fapl033.fnal.gov.
BNL SRM SE does not respond on port 8443.
Authentication problem at UCTier3 - solved yesterday, but infosystem does not display properly ops support - 
new iteration started. This is not an SRM SE.
</pre>
<ul>
    <li> being followed up </li>
</ul>

3. Gstat does not show OSG (ITB or production) sites. Min will tell us what he needs from our part in order to enable their monitoring (a list of sites in some format).

<ul>
    <li> Antonio sent link to gstat and gave a quick demo </li>
    <li> Antonio asked whether OSG would be ok if gstat could monitor the platform </li>
    <li> Antonio pointed out that gstat is as a matter of fact the Infosys sensor of SAM, so its use in the platform is just an extension of SAM's functionalities </li>
    <li> Anthony will ask </li>
    <li> To be followed-up via e-mail </li>
</ul>

4. Gridview can not be used currently because OSG ITB sites do not have number of CPUs in their infosystem - the attribute is now "obsolete" in the latest Glue Schema. This is tricky to fix. We have basically 3 or 4 sites, so this should not be a problem.

<ul>
    <li> No further comments </li>
</ul>
