---++OSG Interoperability with the WLCG

There has been a lot of progress on Interoperability with the EGEE and WLCG projects. The deployment of a common Information System  based on the BDII and Glue Schema and the development and deployment of Information Providers for the OSG are now  available for installation on OSG Compute and Storage Elements.

Please email [[mailto:goc@opensciencegrid.org][goc@opensciencegrid.org]] if you have any questions.
   * LegacyInteroperabilityActivities - This page lists past interoperability efforts.
   * TroubleTicketExchangeDocumentation - archive of work to ensure ticket exchange between OSG and EGEE. This is in ongoing operation.

---++OSG Interoperability with the PRAGMA

Significant efforts have been made by representatives from both OSG and PRAGMA grid towards interoperability. The initial goal of being able to run [[http://grow.its.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/interpolation/index][OSG application]] on PRAGMA and [[http://goc.pragma-grid.net/applications/FMO/FMO.html][PRAGMA application]] on OSG has been accomplished. The project details are available on the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/gin/pragma/osg-pragma-interoperability.html][OSG-PRAGMA Interoperability]] webpage.
