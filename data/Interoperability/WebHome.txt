---++OSG Interoperability with the PRAGMA

Significant efforts have been made by representatives from both OSG and PRAGMA grid towards interoperability. The initial goal of being able to run [[http://grow.its.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/interpolation/index][OSG application]] on PRAGMA and [[http://goc.pragma-grid.net/applications/FMO/FMO.html][PRAGMA application]] on OSG has been accomplished. The project details are available on the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/gin/pragma/osg-pragma-interoperability.html][OSG-PRAGMA Interoperability]] webpage.

---++Interoperability with XSEDE and Clouds

The Extending Science Through Enhanced National !CyberInfrastructure ([[https://sites.google.com/site/extenci/][ExTENCI]]) Project is improving the interoperability of OSG with Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment ([[https://www.xsede.org/][XSEDE]]) as well as EC2 Clouds.  There are 4 sub-projects:
   1. Distributed Filesystem (!LustreWAN) - See [[https://www.xsede.org/web/xup/knowledge-base/-/kb/document/bajr][XSEDE Albedo]] for publicly available information.
   1. Virtual Machines - Including Tools for creating, managing, distributing, and running large numbers of VMs.  See [[VmManagementTools][VM Management Tools]].
   1. Workflow and Client Tools (Swift) - See [[SwiftInformation][Swift Information]]
   1. Job Submission Paradigms ([[http://www.saga-project.org/][SAGA]]) - See [[http://www.saga-project.org/documentation/tutorials/condor-adaptor][SAGA Condor Adaptor]].
