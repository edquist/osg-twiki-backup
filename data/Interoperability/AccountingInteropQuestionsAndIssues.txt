---+ Accounting Systems Interoperability Questions, Issues, and Proposals
%TOC%
---++ Introduction
This is were all current issues, questions, and proposals that are related to interoperability of the Accounting Systems should be listed.

---++ Questions
---+++ New APEL interface
   * When is the release date?<br>
   * Comment by Main.JohnWeigand - 07 Dec 2010 - Can someone provide a description of this interface?  From what I have understood in the past, this will not affect the current Gratia-APEL interface.  If this is not true, I am totally unaware of the impact.

---+++ Gratia-APEL reporting by resource group
   * Comment by -- Main.JohnWeigand - 07 Dec 2010 - Changes to the Gratia-APEL interface have been made and are currently running in parallel  with the current interface into a test table in the APEL database.    There are no differences in the data reported.  The intent is for the new interface to have some validation checks in place against !MyOSG/OIM, LCG LCH Topology and the APEL org_Tier1/2 tables to raise potential  reporting problem conditions.  These are not fully in place as yet so it is a manual process, as it is today, to validate these conditions.  Related to these validations, I don't know whether or not these should go here ( https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Interoperability/AccountingAndWLCG ) or in the details of the interface documented here: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/GratiaInterfacesApelLcg

---+++ %GREEN%Where is the OSG documentation that points to the registration process in !MyOSG/OIM.%ENDCOLOR%
Comment by Main.JohnWeigand - 07 Dec 2010 - It probably exists but I cannot easily find it when I go the the main OSG release documentation page here: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/WebHome . It seems there should be something that tells people they need to register with OSG.  It is just not obvious.

Resolved 12/20/10 (Main.JohnWeigand) - Received this link from the OSG GOC: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMStandardOperatingProcedures and incorporated it in https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Interoperability/AccountingAndWLCG#OSG_Registration
