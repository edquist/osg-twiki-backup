---++ Topics of Discussion

---+++ Information Systems
   * OSG BDII - Top level BDII
      * Time line for data quality and caching BDII - by June 2011
      * was approved as a short term proposal (3 months)
   * WLCG attributes now have "native" support in the latest release of GIP.  This release is also in the latest OSG release.
   * CREAM support in GIP coming soon

---+++ Computing/Storage
   * CREAM Client - The client works and has generated interest from other projects as well.
   * glideinWMS has been tested against CREAM sites in the WLCG successfully.  

   * Fermilab VOMS server registration
      * CMS needs to follow up on whether or not to have it as an actual VOMS server

   * Do OSG sites need to register with EGI's GOCDB?
      * not necessary
      * probably shouldn't due to policy (sites registered are outside the administrative domain of EGI)
      * However, OSG may need to have an option at registration time to register some services and resources with EGI

   * Operational services interoperability
      * There was an issue with GSTAT where OSG wasn't known as a user so wasn't invited to a recent requirements gathering activity
      * Changes were made that caused a breakage to occur.  This particular issue has been solved and work has been done to come to an agreement regarding change management and Service Level Agreements(SLA).  An initial SLA has been sent out.
      * Discussions have begun at this meeting and elsewhere to establish communication regarding services that OSG uses from the EGI infrastructure and vice versa.
      * As a part of the interoperability effort, we will put together a list of operational services that we believe are used for interoperability.  This list will be hosted on the interoperability tWiki.

---+++ Authorization Services
   * VOMS Admin/VOMRS
      * vulnerabilities found by Univ. Madison and Barcelona experts
         *  addressed by developers but only for the latest release of VOMS Admin
         *  changes *NOT* backported to older versions
         *  WLCG decided that they would get rid of older releases since on SL5 the risk was elevated to HIGH, and most instances were running on SL5
         *  Alain Roy from OSG is already in the loop
      * Bug - CA format for OpenSSL 1.x causes errors that prevent VOMS Admins from starting 
         *  this bug also affects VOMRS
      * WLCG would like to get rid of VOMRS once all required features are in VOMS Admin

---+++ General Information
   * EMI first release will be around the end of April
      * WLCG will make recommendations on deployment of released components based on testing

   * OSG grant ends August of this year
      * work on going to extend the grant for another 5 years, there is confidence that the grant will be extended
      * However, due to budget cuts at the Government level, there will be some changes
