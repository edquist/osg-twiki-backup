---+++ VOMS 3
   * EMI 3, just released Monday (March 11, 2013), contains VOMS 3
   * potential problems
      * every VO must have their own instance of VOMS-Admin, which means that each instance on a server must have a different port
      * All gridmap files will need to be updated to include the new port
      * one solution is to run a redirector
   * post EMI support
      * funding for support of VOMS 3 is good for 1 - 1.5 years
      * after that, "community" support

---+++ SHA-2

   * Aug 1 timeframe won't happen for WLCG
   * CERN SHA2 CA yet to be set up, but Tony will get a cert from there to perform testing on OSG infrastructure
