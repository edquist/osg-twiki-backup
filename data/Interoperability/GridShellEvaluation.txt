---++Introduction

---++About the <nop>GridShell

---++A Short Summary about Up-to-Date <nop>GridShell Evaluation

<nop>GridShell provides an interface for a user to create a “single” virtual cluster that is based on multiple physical clusters. Condor glidein mechanism based on Globus job submission is used to virtualize resources that are marshaled as accessible through a tcsh/csh shell. The support for other shell environments (e.g., bash) is being developed. The installation of <nop>GridShell is very straightforward, and little configuration is needed. It has been tested that <nop>GridShell works for simple job submissions via “condor_submit” across several OSG systems as well as between an OSG system and several <nop>TeraGrid systems. 

It is a reasonable idea to put <nop>GridShell as part of the OSG gateway to the <nop>TeraGrid based on the fact that <nop>GridShell provides a straightforward way for users to roam across OSG and <nop>TeraGrid resources. The following several issues still require further investigation and evaluation. 

---* The number of pre-booked cluster nodes (through glidein jobs) might get large, which might not necessarily dedicated to actual job running for a certain period of time. <nop>GridShell supports to shorten this period through a static configuration parameter. It is a reasonable idea to base the selection of appropriate number of cluster nodes on some dynamic resource discovery strategies that would use information services. This idea requires further research. 

---* Dynamically created condor pools are not shared among multiple logins/users, which might pose a challenge when supporting a large number of users becomes necessary.

---* When shell clients are based on OSG machines, the communications between Condor-starters and the Condor-master based on TCP might require extra security configurations (e.g., firewall rules for opening ports). But generally this is not a concern because Globus Toolkit requires such configurations anyway.
