---+Installation procedures
 
 There is a common procedure how to install cms software without X-based GUI.
 You must get download.sh from here:
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/oo/repos_standalone/download/doc/xcmsi/node4.html
and request three packages: ORCA_8_7_3, OSCAR_3_6_5 and CMKIN_4_3_1. Everything else which is needed to run these applications will be delivered as well.

 > ./download.sh OSCAR_3_6_5

 > ./download.sh ORCA_8_7_3

 > ./download.sh CMKIN_4_3_1

 You must have enough disk space to do that (typical is 5-10GB free on this partition). 

 This is small description of command-line installation:
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/oo/repos_standalone/download/doc/xcmsi/node5.html

 You have to step in to the XCMSInstall subdir which appeared when download will be completed and run cmsi.pl script without any arguments.

 > cd XCMSInstall

 > ./cmsi.pl


 That's it. Of course, in reality it might be more complex that just that, so please ask me in case of problems or authors of the scripts...
