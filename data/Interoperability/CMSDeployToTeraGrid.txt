---+Installation procedures
 
 There is a common procedure how to install cms software without X-based GUI.
 You must get download.sh from here:
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/oo/repos_standalone/download/doc/xcmsi/node4.html
and request three packages: ORCA_8_7_3, OSCAR_3_6_5 and CMKIN_4_3_1. Everything else which is needed to run these applications will be delivered as well.

 > ./download.sh OSCAR_3_6_5

 > ./download.sh ORCA_8_7_3

 > ./download.sh CMKIN_4_3_1

 You must have enough disk space to do that (typical is 5-10GB free on this partition). 

 This is small description of command-line installation:
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/oo/repos_standalone/download/doc/xcmsi/node5.html

 You have to step in to the XCMSInstall subdir which appeared when download will be completed and run cmsi.pl script without any arguments.

 > cd XCMSInstall

 > ./cmsi.pl


 That's it. Of course, in reality it might be more complex than just that, so please ask me in case of problems or authors of the scripts...

---++ Gridshell installations

 First of all your have to get gridshell distribution from TACC:

> wget http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/~ewalker/gridshell-v0.9.9.tar.gz

 Specific places on each cluster:

---+++ Purdue

/tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/gridshell-v0.9.9 is the main installation
directory. Correspondent Condor distribution is in /tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/condor

 cshrc.gtcsh file from /tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/gridshell-v0.9.9 should 
be included in ~/.cshrc

 Correspondent grid project must be defined in ~/.cshrc:

> setenv _GRID_PROJECT_NAME TG-PHY050026T


---+++ UC

/software/linux-sles8-ia32/community/osg/cms/litvin/gridshell-v0.9.9 is the main installation

cshrc.gtcsh file from /software/linux-sles8-ia32/community/osg/cms/litvin/gridshell-v0.9.9
should be included in ~/.cshrc

 Correspondent grid project must be defined in ~/.cshrc:

> setenv _GRID_PROJECT_NAME TG-PHY050026T


---+++ TACC

/projects/cmsim/gridshell-v0.9.9 is the main installation
directory. Correspondent Condor distribution is in /projects/cmsim/condor

cshrc.gtcsh file from /projects/cmsim/gridshell-v0.9.9 should 
be included in ~/.cshrc


 Correspondent grid project must be defined in ~/.cshrc:

> setenv _GRID_PROJECT_NAME TG-PHY050026T



---++ MCPS installation

MCPS-v00-00-02d was installed at TACC cluster in /projects/cmsim/MCPS-v00-00-02d


---++Purdue

 Login hostname is tg-login-linux.purdue.teragrid.org.

 Main entry point for CMS software is /tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/

 Release area is /tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/rel1

 To be able to work you have to do next:

1) Add scram tool in you PATH:

setenv PATH ${PATH}:/tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/rel1/Releases/SCRAM

2) Add one extra lib directory in you LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/lib



---++UC

 Login hostname is tg-viz-login.uc.teragrid.org. 

 Main entry point for CMS software is /software/linux-sles8-ia32/community/osg/cms/litvin

 Release area is /software/linux-sles8-ia32/community/osg/cms/litvin/rel1

 To be able to work you have to do next:

1) Add scram tool in you PATH:

setenv PATH ${PATH}:/software/linux-sles8-ia32/community/osg/cms/litvin/rel1/Releases/SCRAM

2) Define SCRAM_ARCH

setenv SCRAM_ARCH Linux__2.4


---++TACC (lonestar)

 Login hostname is tg-login.tacc.teragrid.org. 

 Main entry point for CMS software is /projects/cmsim

 Release area is /projects/cmsim/rel1

 To be able to work you have to do next:

1) Add scram tool in you PATH:

setenv PATH ${PATH}:/projects/cmsim/rel1/Releases/SCRAM



---+HOW TO run the typical applications

 If you defined everything specified above, you can run "scram list" to look at the list of installed packages. Please let me know in case of problems (litvin@hep.caltech.edu)

If you can see all projects, you can try to check it out and play with them:

---++ OSCAR Applications

 Typicaly , you don't need anything to modify here, so you can just create
environment and define everything to work with:

 > cd /tmp

 > mkdir lva

 > cd lva

 > scram project OSCAR OSCAR_3_6_5

 > cd OSCAR_3_6_5/src

 > eval `scram runtime -csh`

 or 

 > eval ` scram runtime -sh`

 > oscar 



---++ ORCA Applications


 > cd /tmp

 > mkdir lva

 > scram project ORCA ORCA_8_7_3

 > cd ORCA_8_7_3/src

 > cp -r specorcadir/src/Examples .

 > cd Examples/ExProduction

 > eval `scram runtime -csh` (if you have tcsh)

	or 

 > eval `scram runtime -sh` (in case of bash)

 > writeAllDigis





---++Purdue

 specorcadir = /tg_community/linux/osg/litvin/rel1/Releases/ORCA/ORCA_8_7_3

---++UC

 specorcadir = /software/linux-sles8-ia32/community/osg/cms/litvin/rel1/Releases/ORCA/ORCA_8_7_3

---++TACC (lonestar)
