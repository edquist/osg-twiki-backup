---++ Local Storage

---++ WN Client Package

__Notes from last week:__

	* Should a grid install directory be visible from the worker nodes or not. Frank: yes. For example, an =srm-cp= client available in my path, and in a standard way, no matter where I land.  Do we want this to be the same package? (has client and server packages). What should, and should not be exposed? Would need to review carefully. 
	* Three packages?
		* OSG-Server
		* OSG-Client (for job submission, includes Condor-G) 
		* OSG-WN-Client (has stuff needed by landed jobs on compute nodes) - served from $GRID.
	* There is also the static grid3-info.conf script, its needed for GIP, and should be maintained for backwards compatibility for some time. (Mark notes there is a character limitation for passing environmental variables via PBS.)  This could be a problem for sites that do not want to run an NFS server on the gatekeeper.
	* Franks comments. Addressed in points above.
	* Propagation of the grid proxy.
		* Normally requires shared directory
		* LCG doesn't have shared directory, propagates via the job manager.  What about OSG?
		* For OSG, we will require a shared directory for the time being (OSG 0.4).
		* Need to articulate, separately, where we store the user proxy certificate and gass cache. (eg. $HOME) -- but the site must be responsible for this.
		* The documentation has to describe these types of CE storage spaces (so far): $GRID, $APP, $DATA.
	* Minimum requirement for an OSG site has four options, see: LocalStorageRequirements#Minimum_requirements
	* *Note* Marco will provide a new link which articulates the agreements. This will be linked to Neha's page.
	* Xin: How does an application developer find out which scenario is in use?  GIP, grid3-info.conf, and GridCat.
	* Identify components of OSG-WN-Client.  Supposed to be "universal" tools.  Ruth believes the VO's should be responsible for this, stored by the VO. 
	* =configure-osg.sh= asks the questions for the variables.  This would have have to be re-written (Leigh and Marco will collaborate).  What about unused (empty) variables?  Leave empty.





---++ Validation

	* ValidationPage, in particular USCMS Daily validation of the ITB, [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/Validation/][here]].  Burt and John have setup a page to validate the production releases. For the ITB it is under production.

	* From John, http://home.fnal.gov/~weigand/osg/osg-030.html


---++ Face to Face Meeting

	* The ITB signed off on November 30, December 1 @ Fermilab


---++ ITB Installations as of last week (tbu: "to be udpated" during meeting)

	* Status of testbed installaions of ITB 0.3.0:
		* UC - [[http://pgl.uchicago.edu/twiki/bin/view/Tier2/DevITB][in progress]].  
		* IU - OSG 0.3.0-ws up, WS-GRAM working, MDS4 opened Bug [[http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3856][3856]]. Resource is in  GridCat with the shortname of [[http://osg-itb.grid.iu.edu/index.php?view=sitename&whichmap=us&numentries=100&sortval=services&id=16][IUPUI]]
		* TTU - not here
		* UB - not here
		* BNL - not here: from Xin via email: _Yes, I have done the pacman install part on gridtest01, our new ITB GK. There was a problem in VDT that couldn't handle the globus user account home dir if it's on NFS (root squash), Alain said that will be fixed in VDT 1.3.8. We got around it yesterday and now I am about to configure it, but get distracted to many other things today..._
		* FNAL - no success - 
			* Burt was having problems with grid exerciser.  need to confirm with another site.  Alain consulted.  
			* John is having trouble with the configure monalisa script (this comes from VDT).  Alain is aware of this - needs a pretty big update - will be targeted for 1.3.8.  This was re-written to fit into the VDT environment better.  John has a URL describing the problem.  Some of this is VDT specific, not easily integrated back into VDT.  Iosif is helping, hope to provide a new version by tomorrow. 
		* IOWA - Have installed ITB release, and still have to configure Condor.  Could submit fork jobs just fine (pre-webservices version).  Hope to fix by end week. 
		* PU - was able to sort out issues with ws-gram not finding pbs logs.  Problem was with how local installation organizes its logfiles. Fixed with a symlink. Allow a site to designate a filename rather than a directory location (this is for ws-gram)?  Alain doesn't think its configurable at the moment (confirms later that the piece of gram that reads logfiles).  Submitting simple jobs from another box with gt4 client tools. Note - these are available separately in the VDT (for those that want to test).  Question comes up as to whether GridCat can develop a status check of these WS gatekeepers?  Suggestion is to whether this could be presented into the Discovery service.  (Aside - can the interface to the discovery service documented some place? Michael says is really meant as proof of concept rather than a designed interface for users. Can this be captured on a readiness plan? 
		* Caltech - Suresh is starting to work on upgrading their Opteron cluster.  Probably delayed till after SC05.
		* Kent - ligo will install after SC05.  Also want to upgrade with FC4.  (John is installing on FC4).  Alain - thought FC4 was already supported.  (Note will be trying to run on 0.3.0 sites.) Have tried on FSU.  Let Kent know when a site is ready, will send a LIGO application.
		* Horst - will also install when Panda work cools down.

	* Other comments - many of the questions are now gone.  Possible issue with Condor and Monalisa configuration.
