---++Introduction

This document desvcribes how users can use an OSG CE and discover its features.

REMEMBER: in OSG not all CEs will offer the same features in terms of disk spaces

---++Possibilities

A definition of the concepts used in this document can be found in LocalStorageRequirements, including a [[LocalStorageRequirements#Minimum_requirements][section]] describing which are the possible minimum features available (different alternatives possible).

You will always be provided a WN_TMP area where you will have to put your run directory (possibly in an unique subdirectory to avoid conflicts with othe jobs running on the same host). 

You will have to define your favorite way of working and possibly be ready to adopt alternatives if that is not available.

The path/URL of CE storages can be provided to you in different ways:
	1. variables defined in the environment that resolve to the correct path or URL (starting from VDT 1.3.8, it may not be in OSG 0.4)
	1. path or URLs consistent across the CE (headnodes and WN), published using an information system (e.g. GIP and BDII)
	1. it is still possible but DEPRECATED (will be removed from future versions) the use of !GridCat Web pages or !DataBase
	1. it is DEPRECATED the use of self discovery looking for files like =osg-info.conf=. These internal mechanisms may change across releases and users cannot count on them.

---++Examples

---++Contributed Examples
Here OSG users can contribute (writing it or linking it) a description of their application and how it is using CE local storage. These may include specific references that may not apply to any other application.
