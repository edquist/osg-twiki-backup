---++Introduction

The Authorization system determines who can access your resources and how. In the past (Grid3 and most others), authorization was performed via the grid mapfile on the gatekeeper. The gatekeeper looked for an entry matching the Subject Name of the requester's grid credentials and took the first match or denied the request. As of Globus Toolkit version 2.4, there is an authorization callout allowing for external authorization decisions. OSG provides software to implement this callout and this now allows for different options. OSG supports three different modes, described below:  Grid3, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. The flowchart below will help you decide what kind of configuration you should setup.

Definitions:
(Should we collect these somewhere or does this need to be inline ?)
	* Role-based authorization: authorization decisions based on extended proxies (roles and groups in addition to DNs) A user can get a different extended proxy from the VO VOMS server according to the role he/she is to play.  For example, the user may send a request as a member of the analysis group, and at another time may send a request as a production coordinator. Role-based authorization allows the site to map the user to a different account depending on his/her role.
	* Account pools: Each DN is assigned a unique local account from a preallocated pool of local accounts. A particular DN always gets the same local account from then on. A site can choose to have one or more pools (for example, one pool per VO, one pool per group in a VO, one pool per role in a VO, etc...)
	* Central management: being able to control access to a number of gatekeepers from a single file, and not having to look/change configuration on each gatekeeper. (often useful for large sites) (this is vague -- central account management? AH)

---++ Full privilege configuration

In this configuration, requests to your gatekeeper(s) and gridftp server(s) use the authorization callout to contact an external service (GUMS is the OSG reference implementation) which checks whether the requester is permitted access and, if access is permitted, returns a local user id assigned to the requester's grid credential. This removes the need for maintaining grid mapfiles on each gatekeeper and/or gridftp server. 

This checklist will setup a default OSG CE in the full privilege configuration:

---+++ Identify the GUMS server you will be using

There needs to be one GUMS server per map of 'DN to local uid'. An institution would only need one GUMS server if there is a global uid assignment (eg. a single NIS domain), but you'd need multiple GUMS to cover multiple mappings. Choose the appropriate GUMS. If you have no GUMS available, you will need to create one and load the mapping information, first. GumsAdmins contains instructions on how to setup and configure a GUMS service.

Once you have identified the appropriate GUMS, continue.

---+++ Install the GSI and PRIMA modules and configure Globus to use the Authorization modules

Copy these files as shown:
<pre>
	  (do we want to have them backup older versions ?)
	$ cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf	/etc/grid-security/
	$ cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security/
</pre>

The prima-authz.conf file is preconfigured during the VDT installation except for the reference that points to the particular GUMS server to use.
To set the right GUMS server, modify the imsContact line and replace the URL with the one appropriate for your GUMS server, e.g.,:

<pre>
imsContact https://atlasgrid13.usatlas.bnl.gov:8843/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</pre>

(The default URL is a test GUMS server that you can use for debugging your system if need arises. *Will this be true indefinitely ? Probably not. What are plans ?* )

---+++ Test configuration

Run the site_verify script again locally (as a regular user) and verify that the authorization still works. If you have problems, (URL) has some debugging advice on how to identify common problems.




---++ Compatibility configuration
You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. Also, you will introduce delays since each gatekeeper will have to regenerate the map before implementing the new policy or allowing new users. You should fall back to this configuration if:
	* Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured through grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipolate that file directly, without passing through globus)
	* The idea of running GUMS 24/7 scares the hell out of you, and you'd rather approach with caution.
In this configuration, you will have:
	* One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username
	* gums-host running via cron on your gatekeeper(s) to retrieve both the forward and inverse maps
So you need to:
	* Install GUMS at your site
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ Identify the GUMS server you will be using

There needs to be one GUMS server per map of 'DN to local uid'. An institution would only need one GUMS server if there is a global uid assignment (eg. a single NIS domain), but you'd need multiple GUMS to cover multiple mappings. Choose the appropriate GUMS. If you have no GUMS available, you will need to create one and load the mapping information, first. GumsAdmins contains instructions on how to setup and configure a GUMS service.

Once you have identified the appropriate GUMS, continue.


---+++ Configure the GUMS client package 
(isn't this only needed for compatibility mode or is it recommended as a backup for full privilege mode as well ?)

You need to configure the file _gums-client.properties_ to point to the appropriate GUMS server

<verbatim>
# cd $VDT_LOCATION/gums/etc
# cat ../etc/gums-client.properties
gums.location=https://localhost:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin
gums.authz=https://localhost:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</verbatim>

Replace _localhost_ in this example to the name of the GUMS Service host.

Test the service by generating a mapfile at the command line

<verbatim>
# cd $VDT_LOCATION/gums
# ./bin/gums generateGridMapfile 
</verbatim>

Test the gums-host command before adding the cron job
(How do I know if it succeeded ?)

<verbatim>
# ./gums-host generateGridMapfile
</verbatim>

Once tested, set up a cron job to generate the maps every six hours:
<verbatim>
# ln -s $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin/gums-host-cron /etc/cron.hourly/gums-host-cron
</verbatim>

http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html

---+++ Test configuration

Run the site_verify script again locally (as a regular user) and verify that the authorization still works. If you have problems, (URL) has some debugging advice on how to identify common problems.

Instructions for this configuration are located [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo#Full_Privilege_or_Compatability][here]]

(Has anyone gotten this configuration to work ???)

---++ Grid3 configuration

In this configuration, the authorization callout is not used. Rather individual gridmapfiles are created (and updated) on each gatekeeper.
You may prefer this configuration if:
	* You are a small site (one gatekeeper) and,
	* You deal with a small set of fairly static VOs

In this configuration, you will have:
	* The EDG mkgridmap daemon running on your gatekeeper to create the grid-mapfile

Here is the checklist for configuring a Compute Element gatekeeper in the Grid3 mode:
(It appears in fact that the OSG pacman install preconfigures all this and runs the mkgrid-mapfile automagically. Maybe that's because I was reinstalling on a machine that had previously been setup ??)

---+++ Setting up edg-mkgridmap for local users

You probably want to keep some portion of your current gridmapfile (at least your own entry) as locally known users so that you won't get locked out should there be a problem with a VOMS server at some update.

The *edg-mkgridmap* script uses a configuration file to dictate 
  its behavior. This is located at
  *$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf*.

  The *edg-gridmapfile-upgrade* daemon has a similar configuration
  file *$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf*.

  One of the parameters specifies a _local_ *grid-mapfile* that
  will be added to the output of the *edg-mkgridmap* command (the set of DNs returned from all the VOMS)

There are two steps required to make this:

	* Set the *GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE* variable in 
	 *$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf*:

		==GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE=$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local==

	* Add a new directive to the end of the *$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf*:

<tt><b>gmf_local <i>/usr/local/grid</i>/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local</b></tt>

  Now local *grid-mapfile* entries to this file will be 
  added every time the script is executed.

---+++ Configure the list of VOs you wish to enable.
(Is this now automatically configurable given the conventions on VO selections and the master vomses file ?)

The default configuration is to all access from all OSG VOs. If that is acceptable to you, then you're done with this step.

If not, then you'll need to edit the file $VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf
to comment out the lines for the VOs you wish to disable.

---+++ Setup and test access to each selected VOMS services

To do a "shotgun" test of them all, as root, run

<pre> 
$ cd $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin
$ ./edg-mkgridmap --verbose --output=test.out
</pre>
	
  The most common error is "Internal Server Error" which indicates an
  authentication failure.  This can happen either because access to the
  VOMS DB has not been completed, or because the local site credentials
  (host certificate and key) are not valid.  Set the X509_USER_CERT and
  X509_USER_KEY variables to to test using a different, valid, certificate
  and key.

If the VO administrator has not enabled world read of the VO membership, then you must contact the VO
administrator (how ?) and request that your site be given access to the VOMS database. You will need to provide
the Subject and Issuer Distinguished Names (DN) for your host certificate.  The simplest thing to do is send email
to the VO administrator requesting access and including the output of the command

<pre>
  $ openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/certificates/hostcert -noout -text
</pre>

(except I'll bet the output doesn't have the DN's in the proper format. Damn. Anyone got a better way ?)

---+++ Configure the automatic update scripts to refresh the gridmapfile

Since VOs are likely adding/removing members over time, you will want to update your gridmapfile to reflect this. OSG provides some scripts (lifted from the EDG project :-) ) to do that periodically automatically. The following commands will copy and start the daemon.

<pre># cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded /etc/init.d/
</pre>
<pre># /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded start
</pre>

---+++ Test configuration

Run the site_verify script again locally (as a regular user) and verify that the authorization still works. If you have problems, (URL) has some debugging advice on how to identify common problems.



---++ Debugging the authentication chain

A page describing the steps to follow in testing and debugging privilege components has been started under the topic GoldenChainDebugging.

You may find the PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo and VoAdmins topics (older versions of instructions) helpful as well.
