---++Prior Meetings 

   * Home web for meeting minutes is MeetingMinutes  
   * Last week's meeting notes are at MinutesMarch17
   

---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Services Status
Results, plan from meeting of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo service providers yesterday, see VoServices.
Where we are with the current releases, see tables.

   * GRASE - will begin the install today.  Need to get each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo up and running VOMS_admin, global acl is in 0.7.6.  

   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS - more friendly user interface to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, web-based for populating the database. No recommendation for all VOs, the only commitments are to the LHC experiments. 

   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-admin has no user documentation, to populate it correctly? Need to push this back to the privilege project.  VDT 1.3.3 has version VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 1.4.0. Alain cautions while doing upgrades to VDT 1.3.3, and prior.  The VDT 1.3.4 protects things better.

   * A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo repository will be provided by operations.  This will be used by user clients creating role-based proxies.

   * CMS is dealing with installing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS on a Rocks installed cluster - its a new platform for the VDT, and there are issues.

   * CDF, will have a problem with the voms proxy init bug.  (Addendum: see mail from Alan)

   * GUMS issues - for the ITB 0.1.4, we will not use the VDT packaged version as fixes will appear in VDT 1.3.4.  There will be instuctions pointing to the GUMS website.

   * Core MIS news: 0.2.6 to be released next Monday.  Is this compatible with the next VDT release timeframe? Yes. Even if not, it can be in the ITB 0.1.5 release via the OSG cache.

   * SRM-DRM  - needs the old proxy to copy files. The LBL people are working on it, but they expect it will take a week. Jorge thinks this will not make it for OSG 0.2. Still lots of questions about deployment.  It is agreed we can continue keep it ITB agenda for integration purposes.


---++ Deployment Guidance
Review guidance from deployment, DeploymentGuidance050318, and determine appropriate actions.

We review the timelines.  April 1 as the target release for VDT 1.3.4, we need to make sure ITB 0.1.4 feedback is given in time.

---++ ITB 0.1.4 Release 
Review description of ITB release.

   * Description, ItbRel014
   * Instructions for SiteAdmins
   * Instructions for VoAdmins
   

---++ Action Items for Next Week

   * Sites to install ITB 0.1.4: Florida, Suresh, Leigh (IU), Alan (TT), FSU, UB
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo repository - defer to ITB 0.1.4, but provide a package otherwise available for voms-proxy-init clients
   * Provide any feedback to Wisconsin for VDT 1.3.4.
   * Iterate on the documention
   * Plan ITB 0.1.5 release candidate, which would be the primary candidate deployment
   * Report on successful, failing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo authentication functionality

---++ Schedule
   * Post VDT 1.3.4 release (roughly April 1 to April 5) move towards ITB 0.1.5.
   * Second week of ITB 0.1.5 - validation of scalability
   * Mid-May OSG deployment
