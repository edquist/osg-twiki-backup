---++ NFS-lite update (Terrence, David)
   * Terrence is working on making this an optional configuration parameter - working with Horst and Ligo testing. 
   * Thinks he has a general configuration parameter - for optinal selection - to support the remote "initial dir" directory.
   * David - standing down until integration is complete.  Would go into VDT 1.5.
   * About two weeks to get into VDT's hands, will come in the form of a patch.
   * Should take a look at similar developments in Globus for condor job managers.
   * Is there any equivalent work in progress for a PBS job manager.  Alan Sill was looking at this - waiting to see results from the Condor scheduler/development.  Also, PBS has sandboxing built in, which can be used.

---++ CEMon - anything new?
   * A report is available for validation, (URL).
   * Working with Steve Timm to put together some numbers to understand the load.
   * Installation on top of 0.4.1 installations?  That is done a OU and is working. Horst says it was an easy install.
   * There are some ITB 0.5.0 installs (Iowa, Fermigrid) that are advertising resources.
   * Still looking for volunteers.
   * Would like to reprocess 125 TB of D0 data - using the resource selection system.  Advised to bring this to the attention of ET.

---++ VDT 1.4.0 release news
   * Expect release tomorrow, basically 1.3.11 with 6-8 bug fixes.
   * Will be available for use on ITB.

---++ ITB 0.5.1 likely schedule
   * Rob Q and JW have been testing, based on pre-rel of VDT 1.4.0, all looks good.
   * NSF-lite could come in as an "unsupported package", on top of ITB 0.5.1.
   * After the release, will change to final names, and announce.
   * Roll call: IOWA, LIGO-CIT, OU, IU, FNAL, GU, UC, FNAL-BURT.
   * Installed sites will show up in GridCat, for registered sites.  
   * Default *status* setting will be *inactive* (or grey). 

---++ AOB
   * Next week's meeting will focus on the state of the install of ITB 0.5.1; meeting will be chaired by David Meyers/LIGO-CIT.
