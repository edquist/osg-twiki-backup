---++Introduction

  This is the OSG Information Service Readiness Template.


---++Description of the Service

   * The Information Service will have a Client, information gathering, element and a grid-wide service which will collect and publish the informations.
      * On each resource the will be installed client software (GenericInformationProviders) which populate the Glue Schema (GlueOSG).  The output of the information gathering scripts will be inserted into an LDAP server, which is configured for the information schema. The configuration will be derived from the LCG developments and is named BDII.This information providers and the BDII service is not optional. The BDII running on the resource will be refered to as the  <b>Site BDII.</b>
      * There will be at least one Collector BDII which is configured to query each
        Site BDII to create a repository for all collected information from resources.
 
---++Dependencies and Other Services

   * The major dependancy for this system is the correct configuration of the 
     information providers.

---++Required Resources

   * On the client site there are several components which need to be installed and
     configured to run automatically.
      * VDT package - GLUE-Schema     http://cvs.infn.it/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/datatag-glue/glue-extension/glue-schema/
      * VDT package - Generic-Information-Provider    http://lfield.home.cern.ch/lfield/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?area=gip&page=documentation
      * OSG iTB package -  iVDGL:osg-gip
      * OSG iTB package -  iVDGL:site-bdii
---++Server Requirements

   * The server informaiton will be provided here.

---++Packaging

   * These components are pacmanized and available from the VDT and OSG iTB 
     pacman repositories.


---++Installation and Configuration

   * Provide installation *and* configuration instructions.


---++Test Harness

   * Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one understanding everything is working properly? Are all required functionality tests successful?

---++Validation

What is required for meaningful validation, both _functional_ and _scalability_ tests.

   * Scalablity tests - what are the expectations in terms of performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful integration.

   * Known problems, limitations, and pending issues.


---++Contact Information

   * Contact information for support of the service in the integration phase (as distinct from production operations in the OSG).
