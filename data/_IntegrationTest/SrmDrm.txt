---++Introduction

This topic describes activities associated with integration and testing of the SRM/DRM.

---++SRM/DRM readiness plan 

1.	Goal : to deploy DRM, an SRM implementation onto of a disk-based unix file system, on to a standard OSG-SE/CE.

2.	Purpose: to provide managed access to tactical storage on execution sites.

3.	Method 

	* Provide access to tactical storage through the SRM interface by putting an SRM on to the $DATA space. 

	* Operate the site with the new service and establish that the operation of all other OSG services function properly and/or as expected. 

	* Create web presence for the activity through GridCAT and/or MonAlisa. 

4.	Status: STAR analysis scenario works; an app runs jobs that creates result files and moves the files of the remote archival site. 

5.	Test and verify the DRM service: srm-tester is available through VDT as a separate package or through the same DRM package to test its SRM compatibility and interoperability.

6.	Plans:
	* Schedule an CMS application test and determine what changes need to be made to the site configuration and OSG services 
	* Another application such as ATLAS or SDSS to repeat the test
	* Determine and document performance and scalability of the site with the added DRM services
