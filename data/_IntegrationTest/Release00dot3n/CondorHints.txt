---++Introduction
What we did to install condor in a separate location:

Make a directory that is separate from where your $VDT_LOCATION is going to be
cd into it.  I put mine in /export/osg/condor

<pre>pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_139_cache:Condor</pre>

Answer "y" to the question of whether to enable the condor batch system to run automatically
Answer "n" to the question of whether to start edg-crl-upgraded
Answer "n" to the question of where to install the CA certificates.

With the above directory structure, you would then 

=export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION="/export/osg/condor/condor"
