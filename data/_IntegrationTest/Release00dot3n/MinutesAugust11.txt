---++Issues from last meeting

   * The numbering policy. OSG ITB next release name?  (0.1.7)  (0.3.0)  (0.2.2) 
   * $APP, $DATA, $TMP, .. and all that
    <a href="LocalStorageRequirements">Burt has Twiki-ized the proposal.</a>  People can feel free to comment and mark up.
    come to some agreements: 
  
A. how to find out information from sites

  stated requirements:
  
   * Should a local callout be required?  Or a starting point for the local env. as config. 
      by the site
   * need jobs on the worker node needs to discover ( path differentiation )
   * teragrid uses workernode/profile.d/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-env
   * other interoperbility requirements 
   * globus job manager should add the OSG env. and this could be pushed to the jobs 
   * effort for site admins.. configuration of the worker nodes 


   1. GridCat has incomplete or incorrect information
   1.  These env should be discoverable by applications currently
               source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/../monitoring/grid3-info.conf
          This should / could sourced by the job-manager
   1. GIP ( next release ) 
   1. Application reads and writes its setup script.

---++++ Activity formed
   1. Alain Roy
   1. Ransom
   1. Saul
   1. Iwona
  
  Charged to bring the common envirnoment to the worker node in a consistent way.
  (using the globus-job-manager.conf or batch_manager.pm)


B.  minimal requirements for $APP and friends

   * $APP - where vos store the application
   * $DATA - update from local filesystem to local filesystem *OR* DRM/GSIFTP accessed by worker nodes
      * Dcache?  SRM? ( using local libraries )
      * must be "open read and write"
      * what are the requirements for a storage element?
   * $TMP (shared temp) -  24 hours local filesystem  (need to extent time to live in this area )
   * $TMP_WN  ( local temp ) - worker node location

 how can we define read/write access?
 Staging in/ Staging out should it be different?


---+++ GIP configuration updates 


 Shaowen and Leigh will work to put an package together for OSG ITB sites, to be included
  in the OSG ITB or next VDT release.


---+++ topics for next week


   * Fermilab VO: Steve Timm and Dan Yocum
     * This is Fermigrid; VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 
   * MIS VO
     * This is for the CI infrastructure - main customers are GridCat and ACDC. 
   * LIGO
     * LIGO VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS has been up for a month - we should start using it.
   * An email should be sent out describing how to to include these VOs. 
   * We need the authoritive list of VOs that are being supported.
   * Alan suggests adding a way of updating a component in the software cache in between releases.  Have a daily cron script update automatically, only for particular scripts.  Can this be handled in Pacman?  Saul thinks so.  Separate out a pacman cache that is more volatile, and updated regularly?

   * GT4 readiness
      * See the WSGramServiceReadinessPlan off the GlobusOSG page. VDT schedule?
   * Policy information
      * New activity forming for Policy.
      * Need to follow up on the short term publication proposal.
   * Addition of SRM client tools (srm-cp)
   * Update to the default GIP configuration (Ransom, Shoawen)
