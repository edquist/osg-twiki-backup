---++ Carryover items from last week

	* Changes for Grid Cat - Bockjoo will migrate to the osg-attributes.conf. Timeline in order to parse the new key value pairs: Bockjoo thinks he'll need at least a month to do this, for the display?
	* SITE_READ, SITE_WRITE - how are these accessed by applications?
	* APP and DATA directories are available, but the new locations are available yet.  Does this require a revision of the GLUE schema?  
		* Shaowen will work on publishing these via GIP. Will do some homework, and will send out email.	
	* Anyone testing job environment package with PBS?
	* Sites upgrading to 0.3.3
		* Steve
		* John W
		* Iowa - looking into job manager condor
		* Burt
		* UB
		* Teraport
		* Xin - having Condor problems
		* UC - starting tomorrow
		* At IU, one web and pre-web

	* VDT 1.3.9
		* New version of ML which fixed new bugs (eg. finding Condor history file); drop in VDT?
		* Agreed drop in and we'll validate it
	* GridEX supporte on all sites of ITB yet? into this VO. Comes in as iVDGL user, http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/GridEx#GEx_User_Identity.  
	* Alain will follow up with Rob Quick on versioning the packages in the iVDGL cache.
	* Shaowen thinks they can quickly deliver the changes in the GIP package. Can they be incorporated into VDT 1.3.9 in time? Alain would want it in place by Friday.  Burt is willing to let the VDT schedule to slip a bit to incorprate this.  John W will be testing as well.
