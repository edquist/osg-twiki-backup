---++Introduction
The [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu][MonALISA]] (Monitoring Agents in A Large Integrated Services Architecture) system provides a distributed service for monitoring, control and global optimization of complex systems. It is based on an ensemble of autonomous multi-threaded, agent-based subsystems which are registered as dynamic services and are able to collaborate and cooperate in performing a wide range of monitoring and decision tasks in large scale distributed applications, and to be discovered and used by other services or clients that require such information. 


---++Configuring MonaLisa

The setup of MonaLisa is done with the assistance of the configuration scripts. 


* Run the configuration script to setup MonaLisa

# ./configure_monalisa.sh

Please specify user account to run MonaLisa daemons as: [monalisa]: 

_This is the name you will be seen by the world, so please choose
a name that represents you. Make sure this name is unique in the 
MonaLisa environment._

Please specify the farm name [host.domain.edu]:Caltech_OSG 

Please enter your contact name (your name) [root]: leighg

Contact email (your email) [root@worldgrid.iu.edu]: leighg@indiana.edu

City (server's location) []: Bloomington

Country []: USA

  You can find some approximate values for your geographic location from:
http://geotags.com/
or you can search your location on Google

Do you want to enable Ganglia support (y/n)? [y]y

  On which host is Ganglia Running? [localhost]: 
  On which port is Ganglia running? [8649]: 
Do you want to enable VO_Modules support (y/n)? [y]: y

Please review the information:

MonaLisa user: monalisa 
Farm name: worldgrid.iu.edu
Name: leighg
Email: leighg@indiana.edu
City: Bloomington
Country: USA
Latitude: 012
Longitude: -012
Ganglia: y (localhost:8649)
VO_Modules: y

Is this information correct (y/n)? [n]: y
#

	 * Edit the site_env file:

		To have MonaLisa interact with the local batch queuing system, the file site_env will need to specify the location of the local files.

# cd $GRID3_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD
# vi site_env

		Make sure the location variable for your batch system is setup and exported, eg:

		PBS_LOCATION or LSF_LOCATION or FBNSG_LOCATION as appropriate.

PBS_LOCATION="/usr/local/pbs";
export PBS_LOCATION;

			 Additionally, at the end of the site_env file add this line to source the Grid3 environment for Monalisa:

			. $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh

			 This is will allow VO modules to collect data from your batch queuing system.
