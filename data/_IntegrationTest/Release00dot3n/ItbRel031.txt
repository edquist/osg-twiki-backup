---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.3.1, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). It is based on [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/index.html][VDT 1.3.8]].  We are providing two deployment options - a fully web services based installation, and one which installs the pre-web services Globus which is
important to many VO's for backwards compatiblity and migration.


---++ Validation and Work Plan
Descriptions of validation exercises of both applications and services using ITB release 0.3.1.  
  
	* Descriptions of validations of the ITB 0.3 series of testbeds are located at the ValidationPage (previous validation page for ITB 0.1.5 is now at ValidationPageRel01).
	* The ITB "homepage" for the current release is IntegrationTestbed.
	* The current ITB 0.3 workplan is [[ITB03WorkPlan][here]].
	* OSGCEInstallGuide is the working set of instructions.

---++ OSG Compute Element (CE) Description
The OSG CE installation has two paths with this version.

| *Pre-Web Services* |  *Web Services* |
| osg-0.3.1 | osg-0.3.1-ws |


These packages deliver the following components (If you want both, install osg-0.3.1 first, then in the same install directory install 0.3.1-ws. Detailed instructions should be in OSGCEInstallGuide):
 
|  *Pre-Web Services* | *Web Services* | *Description* |
|  osg-auto-1.3.8  | osg-auto-1.3.8.-ws | provides a VDT questions setup, osg-version |
|  VDT_138	|  VDT_138-ws  | components from the VDT 1.3.8 package |
|  grid3-schema  || Grid3 Schema for GRIS |
|  osg-grid3-info-prov  || configure-osg and grid3 information files |
|  OSG:vo-0.2.1  || OSG VO's |
|  OSG:gums:cron  || Fix for Client Gums installation |
|  srm-cp  || SRM client tool |
|  MIS-CI  || Monitoring interface |
|  osg-gip  || Generic information provider |
|  site-verify  || Site Verification |


---++ OSG Client 

There is a package of client tools available separately:

=pacman -get iVDGL:osg-client=

At the moment this is just VDT-Client (Condor-G, VDS, etc) from the current release of VDT.  We keep this as
a distinct package in case we need to add something in between VDT releases or tools perhaps not included 
in VDT.

---++ OSG Worker Node Client

This is a package of client grid tools expected to be made available jobs executing from worker nodes.  The idea is to provide site administrators flexibility (for performance or installation purposes) in serving these capabilties to client jobs.  Specific content to be determined, but the basic agreement to date is that this should include self-contained Globus clients (including certificate directories) and SRM clients for access to local storage elements.

	* Twiki page with description: WorkerNodeClient

---++ VDT
We will use the 1.3.8 release of the VirtualDataToolkit, see the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.8/release.html">release notes</a>. 

---++ Globus Toolkit 4.0.1

	* Yes, for the web services version above.

---++ Core MIS
Description of the CoreMIS infrastructure to be used, MIS-CI Version 0.2.7-1. 
The Core MIS will be configured by the configure_misci.sh script as a post installation step.

---++ Grid Cat
Description of the GridCat site monitoring catalog to be used.

---++ Information Services

Include here information about GIP's, etc.

	* OsgInformationService Overview 
		* GLUESchema 1.2
		* GenericInformationProviders (GIP)
		* Grid3Schema
		* Grid3InformationProvider


---++ Grid Exerciser
Description of the GridEx service validation application.

---++ MonALISA
MonALISA from VDT is used for this release. 

---++ Privilege and VO Services Infrastructure

Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release. From before, the PRIMA callout for extended proxy certificates has been fixed to match the VOMS usage. Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization is supported too. 

%RED% *Anything special to note regarding Privilege*? %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% *Update this:* The GUMS version should be 1.1.0 from VDT 1.3.8 and the VOMS Admin and VOMS Server should be installed from the VDT 1.3.8 to ensure correct functioning. %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Discovery and Job Monitoring Services

	* See VDT 1.3.8


---++ Site Validation

The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the OSG pacman cache in this release.
