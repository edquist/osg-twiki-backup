---++ Meeting Notes

   * Status of validation efforts of ITB
      * ATLAS validation in progress; 7 sites validated.
      * CMS - Craig has run to all MOP on most all the ITb sites.  Looks good, almost production-like.  Some issues with stage-out failures that need to be dealt with manually.
      * GridFTP-4 - no news.  Has exchanged mail with Mike regarding goals, exchanged scripts.  Again, Craig thinks that it looks good, 10% faster.
      * DiscoveryService validations: 2 of 3 validations performed at UF.  Shows up in the registry at Caltech okay.  Everyting looks good!  Will ask Michael to check off on the validation.  Issues about operations support - will need to revisit this at some point.
      * Accounting - Sudhir is looking at ML client, documenting it, and will add to Validation page. 
      * Policy mechanism: need a webpage. Jorge will take this up with deployment tomorrow.
      * What about GRIS? There hasn't be a strong request from deployment or a service proponent. GIP?  Alain reports that Nate has made some changes and sent back to the providers.  There has not been a lot demand for it.  For USCMS - will do this.  GIP not integrated into the VDT yet.  People are agreeing that this is a good thing to add. 
      * VDT - there is a new Prima, and potentially a new VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, both in the new VDT 1.3.6.  Could be used for the May deployment.  Also, the service certificate can now be used. 
   * Question about deployment cycle, and patching mechanisms.  Lack of a patching mechanism OSG.
   * Want the VDT to work with =pacman -update=.  Alain says this is one of highest priorities, and they are working with Saul on this.
   * Applications meeting at SLAC - June 1,2.  Originally was going to be a meeting for feedback for applications that have run on OSG.  Could turn into a meeting about deployment and installations.
   * We went through the list of http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ItbRel015#Known_Problems
      * We couldn't find a significant problem, given the current ITB 0.1.5's scope.
      * Any major fixes would require going to VDT 1.3.6.
      * Most other improvements would come in with documentation.
      * There probably should be additional documentation about setting batch queue priority settings.
