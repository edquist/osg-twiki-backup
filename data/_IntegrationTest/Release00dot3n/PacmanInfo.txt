---++Introduction

Pacman is a metapacking tool that allows you to define, install, and configure software.
The homepage of Pacman is http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/. 


---+++OSG Recommendations

As part of the service readines plan, Saul has put together some useful comments:
http://atlas.bu.edu/caches/youssef/osg-comments/comments.html.


---++Installation Notes

Some quick notes about getting Pacman.  Pacman 3.11 is the most recent version we've tested with Capone 1.0.0. For Pacman version 3, ensure the correct Python version is installed and available (2.3.x or newer). E-mail from Saul Youssef says that python 2.3.x is not actually required, 2.2 versions are fine.

---+++ Download
First, =cd= to an install directory somewhere.  Then:

=wget= http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz
=> wget= http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.16.1.tar.gz

Then unpack the tarball:

=tar xzvf pacman-latest.tar.gz=

Next, setup your environment (eg., for release 3.12):
=> tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.16.1.tar.gz=
=cd pacman-3.12=

For =sh= and =bash= shells:
=> cd pacman-3.16.1=
For =sh= and =bash= shells:<br>
=$ source setup.sh=
For =csh= and =tcsh= shells:

For =csh= and =tcsh= shells:<br>
=% source setup.csh=
---+++ Unsupported Platforms
=> pacman -get OSG:PACKAGE_NAME= for production 
Note: for Pacman 3.12 running on some Scientific Linux distributions, such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.x x>=1 or Rocks version is 3.1 or greater, you need to do the command:

=%pacman -allow unsupported-platforms=

Then, cd to the directory where you are going to install (will not work
in the pacman-3.12 directory, and type

=%pacman -pretend-platform:RHEL-3=

where you could also put any platform for RHEL-3.  See, =pacman -platforms= for a complete list.
where you could substitute any platform for RHEL-3.
This should be fixed in a later version.

=> pacman  -platforms=
