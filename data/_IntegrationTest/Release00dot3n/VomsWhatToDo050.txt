---+!!<nop>OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 0.5.0 Installation Instructions
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%
---++Introduction
The [[http://hep-project-grid-scg.web.cern.ch/hep-project-grid-scg/voms.html VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS]] (Virtual Organization Membership Service) has three main parts: 
<OL>
<LI>A !MySql database which is a persistent repository for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership information, 
<LI>The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat-4.
<LI>The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server, a daemon process which services the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests.
</OL>

Also  included in the installation is a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS client containing the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> for testing.

Here we describe how to install and configure VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS on your Linux machine. When you install VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS as described here, you get all three parts.  It comes with a test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called VDT. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.

We also describe how to remove a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS if the need arises.

---++Changes / resolved problems for this release
All changes related to this VDT release can the viewed at the 
<a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.11/release.html">VDT 1.3.11 release notes page</a>.  
Some more specific changes affecting the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS node follow.

<b>Changes:</b>
<OL>
<LI>The CRL update process that ran as a daemon (<i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i>) has been converted to a <i>root</i> cron process.  The time will be selected randomly at installation time so as to reduce contention for these updates.
<pre>
  6 1 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
</pre>

<LI>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS can now use an  HTTP service certificate. We had been using a copy of the host certificate for the last few OSG/VDT releases, but this caused some security and administrative concerns.  So, if do not already have one, you can request the HTTP certificate for your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS host and replace the <i>cloned</i> HOST certificate.

Prior to OSG-0.5.0, this <i>cloned</i> HOST certificate was created in the <i>/etc/grid-security</i> as <i>vomscert.pem</i> and <i>vomskey.pem</i>.  You will want to remove them and use an HTTP service certifcate as describe later in this manual.
</OL>

<b>Resolved problems/issues:</b>
<OL>
<LI>The problem of running the <i>configure-voms</i> script after <i>root</i> password for <nop>MySql database is set has been resolved. (GOC ticket 66899 / 
<a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=1478">VDT ticket 1478</a>)
You can (and should) now be setting the <i>root</i> password on the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS <nop>MySQL database.

<LI>The problem with the the script to remove a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo from the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS instance. .  Running <i>configure-voms  --remove</i> has been resolved. (GOC ticket 74637/ 
<a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=1517">VDT ticket 1517</a>)

<LI>Log rotation for the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS logs files is now being performed correctly (GOC ticket 74641/ 
<a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=1516">VDT ticket 1516</a>)

---++Pre-requisites for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS  Installation

---+++Certificates
If you do not already have the necessary certificates on this host, this can  be done as a post-install step.  However, it is recommended you get them in advance.  These instructions are base on them being in place prior to installation. 

Instructions for getting the certificate can be found at this 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/requesting_cert.html">VDT site</A>. 
        Also refer to any instructions you may find in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/post-install/README that may be related to this.

---++++HOST certificate
During the installation and configure process (using the <i>configure_voms</i> script) to create a VO, the HOST certificate is added to the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Global ACL list (for the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo being created) to allow  the root user on this machine to update the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo using the command line interface command <i>voms-admin</i>.  So, in effect, the root user is already a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin in this VO.  This is the only purpose for this certificate at this time.

The host certificate should be installed in <i>/etc/grid-security</i> with ownership and permissions as:
<pre>
/etc/grid-security
-rw-r--r--  1 root   root    1176 Nov  7 16:38 hostcert.pem
-r--------  1 root   root     887 Nov  7 16:38 hostkey.pem
</pre>


---++++HTTP certificate
Used by Apache. and the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.

The HTTP certificate for your system should be installed in  <i>/etc/grid-security/http</i> with ownership and permission as:
<pre>
<b>/etc/grid-security</b>
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root         4096 Aug 31 23:00 http

<b>/etc/grid-security/http</b>
-rw-r--r--    1 daemon   daemon       1169 May  8 10:38 httpcert.pem
-r--------    1 daemon   daemon        887 May  8 10:38 httpkey.pem
</pre>



---+++Previous installations
If you have an OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS running and you're about to reinstall or if any of the following daemons are installed and running on your machine, see the [[#ShutdownGuide][Shutdown instructions]] below. 

In addition, if you have a previous installation with the <i>cloned</i> HOST certificate (<i>/etc/grid-security/vomscert.pem - vomskey.pem</i>),  you should remove them.  The HTTP certificate described above will replace their usage.

You should also remove the <i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i> process.  The EDG CRL upgrade is invoked using <i>root</i> cron.


    
---++What's  Getting Installed
These instructions are for  OSG 0.5.0 (VDT 1.3.11) rand OSG 0.5.1 (VDT 1.4.0) release of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.

---+++Software
The following software is installed:
<pre>
    Apache HTTPD 2.2.0
    CA Certificates v18 (includes IGTF 1.8 CAs)
    Fetch CRL 2.6.0
    GPT 3.2
    Java SDK 1.4.2_11
    Logrotate 3.7
    MySQL 4.1.19
    Apache Tomcat 5.0.28
    VOMS 1.6.16-7
    VOMS Admin (client 1.2.13, interface 1.0.3, server 1.2.15) 1.2.15-0
    VOMS Security Update 1.6.16.10
</pre>

---+++Services - /etc/init.d
The services installed and activated are:
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
   -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         6644 Aug 29 23:02 mysql
   -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         4069 Aug 29 23:03 apache
   -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         3304 Aug 29 23:03 tomcat-5
   -rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         9470 Aug 29 23:10 voms
</pre>

In addition, during the installation, a test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called 'VDT' will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the 'VDT' VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo will have to be performed separately.

Note: The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> client in previous releases of VDT (1.3.2 and below) may be incompatible with this release.   If this is of concern to you, you will have to run both an older and a newer VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS to retain compatibility with the older versions of <i>edg-mkgridmap</i>..

---+++Log file rotation
The following are the log files that are configured for rotation with the installation in 
<i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt.logrotate</i>:
  <pre>
# Rotate daily
daily
# Keep a week's worth
rotate 7
# Compress old files
compress
compressoptions -9f
# Truncate, instead of moving, files to avoid problems with apps
copytruncate
# Just ignore it if they're not there
missingok
# Rotate these files

If you would like, we can configure VOMS to start automatically at boot time.

Configuring the VOMS daemon requires
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMS server to run automatically?

Possible Answers:
     y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
        this one..
     n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
        run this one.
     s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
        there is already an instance running, leave it alone.
 
   <b><i>y</b></i>
    :   -----------------------------------------------------

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?
Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
            (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b><i>r</b></i>
   :   -----------------------------------------------------   
   :
Do you want to run a cron job that will upate the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Do you want to update the CA certification revocation lists (CRLs) automatically? [y/n]

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?
Possible Answers:
     y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
        this one..
     n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
        run this one.
     s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
        there is already an instance running, leave it alone.

Downloading [voms-server-1.6.16-7-x86_rh_9.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software//voms/1.6.16-7]...
</pre>
The above line should be the last line of output you see.  The version number of the tarball may be different 
than that shown above.  Do not be concerned with this.

---+++Verify the  installation completed successfully
To verify  the pacman installation was successful, there should be a setup.(c)sh in the VDT_LOCATION.   If present, source it.
<pre>
&gt  cd $VDT_LOCATION
&gt  source setup.sh
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> This does not necessarily indicated that everything was installed and configured successfully.  It just verifies that the pacman installation completed successfully.  There is a lot of other magic that occurs during the process that should be validated.



---++Verifying the Success of the Installation
If all the required certificates were in place prior to the pacman installation, a default VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called <i>VDT</i> has been created already and all the daemon services should be up and running.
This section will take you through the steps necessary to verify that and can also serve as a basic operational trouble shooting guide.

If the certificates were installed <b>after</b> the pacman installation, you will probably fail on most of the verification steps and will have to restart each daemon manually.

For  all the verifications, you will need to source the VDT setup.(c)sh script:
<pre>
&gt  cd &lt VDT_LOCATION &gt
&gt  source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++Verifying  the CRL update cron
The EDG CRL update process (essential if you are collaborating with EDG people) updates the certificate revocation lists on a daily (default) basis.  With the OSG-0.5.0 release, this process is now invoked as a <i>root</i> cron process. 
<pre>
33 5 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
</pre>
The time (05:33 in this case) was selected randomly at installation time and should be different for each installation. This was done to avoid contention on the CA hosts.

To verify it is running is a little more difficult now that it is a cron process.  If the time has past for the cron <i>fetch-crl.cron</i> process to run, you can simply go to your certificates directory and see if the <i>*.r0</i> files exist and have time stamps close to the cron time.  If they exist and have a timestamp close to the cron time, all is well.
<pre>
&gt  cd &lt VDT_LOCATION &gt
&gt  source setup.sh
&gt  cd $X509_CADIR
&gt  ls -l *.r0
<i>....(some sample output)....</i>
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        10024 Sep  1 05:33 9dd23746.r0
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        62032 Sep  1 05:33 a317c467.r0
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        17723 Sep  1 05:33 a692434d.r0
</pre>
If it does not look like it is working, you can run the <i>fetch-crl.cron</i> process manually and review the output.  
The current <i>fetch-crl.cron</i> script checks a variable called <i>QUIET</i> to suppress output.  Set and export this variable, then run the script as seen in the crontab.
<pre>
&gt;  export QUIET=no
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> The number of CRL files does not directly correlate to the number of CAs, 
          but there should be at least 1 and they should never be more than a day old
           unless the cron or cron job is not working.



---+++Verifying  the apache/tomcat daemon
Apache and Tomcat are used to access the WEB user interface of  VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS. 
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         4069 Aug 31 23:04 apache
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         3304 Aug 31 23:05 tomcat-5
</pre>
To verify <b>apache</b> is running:
<pre>
&gt   ps -efwww |  grep  apache  |grep httpd
<b> (there will be a number of these)</b>
root        25014        1  0 Aug31 ?    00:00:03 /usr/local/osg-voms/apache/bin/httpd

      :
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  Verify that it is the only one running with <i>init (pid=1)</i> as it's parent and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION.  

To verify <b>tomcat</b> is running:
<pre>
   &gt   ps -efwww |  grep tomcat

    :
    :
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  Verify that it is the only one running with <i>init (pid=1)</i> as it's parent and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION.  


---+++Verifying  the mysql daemon
<nop>MySql  is used to provide persistent storage of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership data.
<pre>
   <b>/etc/init.d</b>
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         6644 Aug 31 23:03 mysq
</pre>
To verify it is running:
<pre>
&gt   ps -efwww |  grep  mysql

    :
    :
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  Verify that it is the only one running with <i>init (pid=1)</i> as it's parent and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION. 

---+++Verifying the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS WEB UI
If all the certificates were in place prior to the pacman installation, a default VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called <i>VDT</i> was configured.
To verify it is accessible:
<OL>
<LI>Point a certificate-enabled browser window to             
        <i>https://<b>your.host.name</b>:8443/voms/VDT</i>
  <UL><LI>You should be prompted for your certificates passphrase
            <LI>You should get a <i>Welcome to the VDT VO</i> page
   </UL>
<LI>In  the left hand menu under <i>FOR VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo USERS</i>, select <i>My membership details</i>.<br>
         The membership details page should say <i>You are not currently a member of this VO</i>, which you  are not yet.
<LI>Do a <i>Back</i>  in your browser.
<LI>Now select <i>Administer the VO </i>  under the <i>FOR VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo MANAGERS</i>  item on the left menu..<br>
          Then select <i>Create a New VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo User</i> from the new menu.  You should get <i>Access denied</i>.
<LI>Do a <i>Back</i> in your browser, twice, to return to the main page again.
<LI>Select <i>Configuration information</i> under the <i>Configuration</i> menu item.  The 3 items 
        displayed provide the syntax and data content used for the various authorization modes available on the grid  for your VO.  
</OL>
At this point, you know your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS WEB UI is functional.

---+++Verifying the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server daemon
The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server's only purpose is to service <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests for your VO.
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root     root         9470 Sep  1 10:45 voms
</pre>
To verify <b>voms</b> is running:
<pre>
&gt   ps -efwww | grep edg-voms
daemon   28440     1  0 Aug31 ?        00:00:00 /usr/local/osg-voms/glite/sbin/edg-voms 
                                       --conf /usr/local/osg-voms/glite/etc/voms/VDT/voms.conf

</pre>
<b>Note:</b> 
<UL>
<LI>There are individual <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers</i> for each VO, each using a unique port
         to service requests.
<LI>There are usually 2 <i>edg-voms</i> processes that are running for each VO.
        There are times when only 1 is running and the server works fine.  
         This is one of those mysteries in life that one just accepts.
<LI>Verify that  the path contains your <i>VDT_LOCATION</i>.
</UL>

---+++Verifying the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS version
The voms-admin and voms server versions can be verified using the following command:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo VDT  -version
voms-admin v1.2.13-1
server side is v1.2.15
</pre>
If the versions do not display, then there is a problem with either the web interface or the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.

---++Securing your server
All access to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is through apache and tomcat, even the command line <i>voms-admin</i> command.  To secure your server and require only authenticated access, run the following command.
<pre>
 &gt  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
 &gt  $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_apache --secure
 &gt  /etc/init.d/apache restart
restart
</pre>

---++Securing the <nop>MySQL database
The installation does <b>not</b> set the <i>root</i> password for the <nop>MySQL database used by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.  

<b>Note::</b> Once the <i>root</i> password is set, you will have to enter the password on all subsequent <i>configure_voms</i> and <i>voms-admin</i> admin commands.  You will be prompted for it.

To set the <i>root</i> password:
<pre>
&gt  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt  mysqladmin -uroot  password 'YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD'
</pre>


---++Configuring VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS - the configure_voms script
The <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_voms</i> script has been provided for creating and removing VOs from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.

You may be wondering why you are being told about this script before describing the installation process.  
During the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS installation process, this script is executed and creates a 'test' VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called <i>VDT</i>.  After the installation completes, the verification process  uses this <i>VDT</i> test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to determine the success of the installation.  By reviewing this section of the documentation now, you will be more aware of what to look for when you create your own VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo(s).

The <i>configure_voms</i> script is also used to remove any VOs that are no longer needed and will be documented here as well.

---+++Creating a VO
All VOs should be created using the <i>configure_voms</i> script.
<p>Syntax:
<pre>
 configure_voms --server &lt y,n &gt
                --vo &lt vo name &gt
                --mail-from &lt from address on voms mail &gt
                --smtp-host &lt outgoing smtp host &gt
                --vdt-install &lt VDT installation root &gt
</pre>

<b>Note:</b> The <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log</i> contains any messages from its execution  that are not visible in stdout/err on the command line.


The <i>configure_voms</i> script does the following (note: the examples that follow show the files for the <i>VDT</i> test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo that is created):
<OL>
<LI>Creates a <nop>MySql database called <i>voms_VDT</i>.
<pre>
&gt  mysql -uroot

<p>
<LI>Restarts all the necessary services including the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.
<p>
<LI>
A Global-ACL is created for the HOST certificate for this server with <i>allow all</i> 
capabilities.  This allows the <i>root</i> user on this machine to update the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo using the command line interface
command <i>voms-admin</i>.  So, in effect, the <i>root</i> user is already a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin  in this VO.  It is not, however, a member of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo which is an important distinction.
<p>
This <i>root</i> user capability can be removed <b>after</b> an individual  is assigned the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin role as described in the next section.
</OL>

Many default values were applied during this process.  The values applied can  be viewed in the 
<i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log</i> and searching for  
'This is voms-admin-configure'.


---+++Removing a VO 
The <i>configure_voms</i> script is also used to remove a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo from the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS installation:
<pre>
&gt source  $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_voms  -vo &lt vo name &gt  --remove
....(no output indicates success, hopefully)
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> If you have set the <i>root</i> password for <nop>MySQL, you will be prompted for the password when you execute the script.

The script will:
<UL><LI>stop the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server, 
<LI>remove the associated !MySql database, 
<LI>remove all configuration files for the VO
<LI>restart tomcat and apache
</UL>


---++Enabling a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VO - the voms-admin command
Several things have to be done to actually enable your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to begin accepting membership, used for voms proxy generation, and used for the Compatibility and Full  Privilege 
[[OsgCEAuthorization050][authorization modes]] on compute (CE) and storage (SE) element  nodes.

The following sub-sections will reference the default <i>VDT</i> in the text and examples.  When enabling your 
'real' VO, the same steps are required and, where different, it will be noted.


---+++Establishing a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin
A person (or persons) can be designated as the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin for the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo created.  This person(s) has 
administrative capability within VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS that the normal VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo member will not have.  

There are 2 options for adding this capability to an individual:
<OL>
  <LI>The individual <u>is not</u> a member of the VO.   A Global-ACL for that individual with <i>allow all</i> capability allows a person to administer the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS from the command line and WEB UI.<p>
        <UL>
        <LI>Individual's certificate file is available:
<pre>
&gt  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> add-acl-entry Global-ACL \
                 allow all <b>usercert.pem</b>
</pre>
          <LI>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b>  -nousercert  add-acl-entry  Global-ACL \
                  allow all \
                  "<b>USER DN</b>" "<b>USER CA</b>"
</pre>
           </UL>

  <LI>The individual <u>is</u> a member of the VO.  This can be accomplished by giving the individual the Global-ACL
           capability above or by first adding them to the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo as a member (described in the next section) and then assigning them the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i> role with the following command:<p>

        <UL>
        <LI>Individual's certificate file is available:     
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> assign-role  <b>GROUP</b> \
                 VO-Admin <b>usercert.pem</b>
</pre>
          <LI>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> assign-role  <b>GROUP</b> \
                 VO-Admin  \
                 "<b>USER DN</b>" "<b>USER CA</b>"
</pre>
           </UL>      
</OL>

---+++Adding  a user to the VO
Individuals with the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i> role or the  <i>allow all</i> Global-ACL are referred to as VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Managers in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and are the only ones who can add new members via the web ui.
In normal practice, users will request VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership by accessing the <i>New user registration</i> menu item on the main VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS web page.  This document will not go into the details of that process here, nor will it address the basic usage and navigation of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS web ui.

The purpose of this section is to show you how to add a user for the purposes of assigning the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i> role as a part of the initial setup.   

Four data items are required for each user:
<UL><LI>DN
          <LI>CA
           <LI>Common Name (CN part of the DN or just 1st and last name so you can be easily identified)
           <LI>email address 
</UL>

If you have the user's certificate file available, then these 4 items are derived from that.
        <UL>
        <LI>Individual's certificate file is available:     
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> add-member  \
       <b>GROUP</b>  <b>usercert.pem</b>
</pre>
          <LI>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> add-member  \
       <b>GROUP</b>   \
       "<b>USER DN</b>" "<b>USER CA</b>"  \
       "<b>USER CN</b>" <b>USER EMAIL</b>"
</pre>
           </UL>      

If you have added the user for the purpose of assigning the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i> role, you will want to re-visit the
<a href="VomsWhatToDo050#Establishing_a_VO_Admin">Establishing a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</a> section above to assign the role.




---+++Verifying you are a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin
If you've established yourself with the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i> role or with the <i>allow all</i> Global-ACL, you can now go back the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS web ui in a browser with your certificate and from the main menu:
<UL><LI>Under <i>For VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Managers</i>, select <i>Administer the VO</i>
          <LI>Then, select <i>Global ACL</i>
</UL>
You should no longer see the <i>Access Denied</i> error and should be able to see the Global-ACL's  that have been created.   As a <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i>, you can do anything you want.  

<b>Note:</b>  A user with the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin</i> role only has these privileges in the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS web ui.  The command line <i>voms-admin</i>  does not authorize using the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS roles.  It allow <i>voms-admin</i> command line capability, you must establish a Global-ACL with the capability you desire.  By default, only the <i>root</i> user has this on initial installation.



---+++Enabling read-only access to your VO
Another Global-ACL needs to be created with <i>allow list</i> capabilities for anyone that presents a 
certificate issued by a known VO.  The purpose for this is two-fold:
<p>
  <UL>
      <LI>Those sites using [[GumsAdmins050][GUMS servers]] will be able to access your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo without the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Admin having to individually provide this  Global-ACL capability on a case by case basis.  
<p>
      <LI>It allows VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo members or (those that think they are VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo members) to query the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS to troubleshoot problems in getting voms proxies and verify their membership in various groups and role assignments. 
  </UL>
<p>
To enable read-only access, execute the following command:
<pre>
&gt  source $VDT_LOCATION
&gt  voms-admin --vo <b>VO</b>  --nousercert add-acl-entry \
                Global-ACL allow list \
                "/O=VOMS/O=System/CN=Any Authenticated User" \
                "/O=VOMS/O=System/CN=Dummy Certificate Authority"
</pre>


---++Testing access to your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server
There are several functions on the grid that access your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VO:
<OL><LI>voms proxy generation (<i>voms-proxy-init</i>)
          <LI>grid-mapfile generation on the CE nodes
               <UL><LI><i>edg-mkgridmap</i> for Grid3 authorization mode</UL>
           <LI>GUMS  interface  for Compatibility and Full Privilege authorization modes.
</OL>

---+++ Testing voms-proxy-init
The <i>voms-proxy-init</i> client command was included in the installation. The client <i>voms-proxy-init</i> uses a configuration file that contains the necessary arguments to access a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.  On the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server node, this file is  located in the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/vomses</i> directory and looks like this for the <i>VDT</i> VO:
<pre>
&gt  cd $VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc
&gt  ls -ld vomses
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           44 Sep  4 23:03 vomses -> /usr/local/osg-voms/vdt-app-data/voms/vomses

&gt &  cat vomses/VDT
"VDT" "cms-xen3.fnal.gov" "15000" "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov" "VDT" "32"
</pre>
Tokens in the above <i>vomses/VDT</i> file::
<OL>
<LI>Considered a "nickname"  and , although the default is the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name, it can be any value you desire to identify the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you wish  to get a proxy from..  
<LI>The hostname of the voms server
<LI>Port number the server is listening on.
<LI>DN of the server's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS certificate
<LI>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name
<LI>Globus version supported
</OL>
<P>
The <i>vomses</i> file syntax/values for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI of  your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo by selecting <i>Configuration information</i> on the left hand menu of the main page.
<p>
On the server, there is no need to create a <i>$HOME/.glite/vomses</i> file containing the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers you wish to access.  The <i>voms-proxy-init</i> command will search the <i>vomses</i> directory on this server for this file. 

So to test the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> command, you need to do the following:

1. If you have not already added yourself as a member of the VO,  do so now.

2. Then, as yourself (not <i>root</i> user),
<pre>
&gt  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt  voms-proxy-init --voms VDT:/VDT
<b>...output follows.. </b>
Cannot find file or dir: $prefix/etc/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase:
<b><i>... enter your pass phrase .... </i></b>
Creating temporary proxy ............................................... Done
Contacting  cms-xen3.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov] "VDT"  Done
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until Tue Sep  5 23:03:02 2006
</pre>

A couple of things about the output shown above that you might want to be aware of::
<UL>
<LI>The warning about not finding a <i>$prefix/etc/vomses</i> is not a problem.  It should have already picked up the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo server from the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/vomses/VDT</i> file.  This may be a legacy PATH when the vomses file was in <i>$VDT_LOCATION./voms/etc/vomses</i>.
<LI>The "temporary proxy" it generates is the good old grid proxy.  This is used for the access to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and, as it says, just temporary.
</UL>

3. To verify the output of the voms proxy has the extended attributes the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service provides, run the <i>voms-proxy-info</i> command as shown below. The extended attribute and location of the proxy file are highlighted in the output:
<pre>
&gt  voms-proxy-info --all
<b>... output follows....</b>
WARNING: Unable to verify signature! Server certificate possibly not installed.
Error: Cannot find certificate of AC issuer for vo VDT
subject   : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491/CN=proxy

<b>attribute : /VDT/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL</b>
timeleft  : 11:59:36
</pre>
Again, ignore the <i>WARNING</i> and <i>Error</i> in the output above, as all is fine.


4. Now try one for a group you do not belong to, e.g., /MyGroup
<pre>
&gt  voms-proxy-init --voms VDT:/MyGroup
<b>...output follows.. </b>
Cannot find file or dir: $prefix/etc/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase:
Creating temporary proxy .......................................... Done
Contacting  cms-xen3.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov] "VDT" Failed

Error: VDT: Unable to satisfy G/MyGroup Request!

Failed to contact servers for VDT.
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> If a subsequent attempt at a voms proxy fails, as ours did here, the previously generated proxy is still in effect.  
You can do another <i>voms-proxy-info --all</i> to verify this.



---+++ Testing edg-mkgridmap
The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> is run on a site's Compute Element (CE) node to generated a <i>grid-mapfile</i> file.  This script is not provided as a part of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS installation, so you will have to go a CE node to test this.  You do not have to be the <i>root</i> user on the CE node, but you will need to have a personal certificate available.
<p>
The <i>mkgridmap</i> file syntax/values for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI for your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo by selecting <i>Configuration information</i> on the left hand menu of the main page.
<pre>
group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  .VDT
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> The <i>.VDT</i> (3rd token) is an EDG format for the account name.   You will likely want to change it to the group account you want assigned for your CE node.  The example above is for a <i>group</i> account assignment.
<p>
To test, you will need to do this on a CE node.
<UL><LI>In some writable area, create a <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file and populate it with the example configuration file on your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.  It will be the only entry.
<pre>
&gt  echo 'group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  .VDT' >./edg-mkgridmap.conf
</pre>

<LI>Execute the edg-mkgridmap allowing the output to go to stdout:
<pre>
&gt  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt  edg-mkgridmap --conf ./edg-mkgridmap.conf 
Enter PEM pass phrase: 
<b>... enter your pass phrase...</b>
<b>... output follows ...</b>
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491" .VDT
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov"  .VDT
</pre>
</UL>

---+++ Testing the GUMS interface
The GUMS authorization server periodically 'pulls' the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership data for it's authorization and account assignment  functions from the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers.  

Unfortunately, there is no way of testing this except with an installed GUMS server which this document does not address.

---++Shutdown Guide
#ShutdownGuide
The OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS starts up several processes.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS without shutting them down it will fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 0.5.0 services before upgrading:

<ul>
  <li>/etc/init.d/apache stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/tomcat-5  stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/voms stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/mysql stop
</ul>

With OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 0.5.0, CRL updates are no longer performed using the <i>edg-crl-upgraded</i> daemon.  A <i>root</i> cron job now performs this task.  You should probably turn off this cron entry.
<pre>
    6 1 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
</pre>

If you are upgrading from a release prior to 0.5.0, you should also stop the following process and remove it from your <i>/etc/init.d</i> directory:
<ul>
<li>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop  (assuming you activate it)
</ul>
