---++Introduction
With OSG 0.4.1 we are introducing the option for sites to deploy a fork queue that is managed.

Unlike the standard fork jobmanager that simply forks off jobs on demand, the managed fork jobmanager submits local universe jobs to a Condor queue. Jobs still run on the headnode, but this gives site administrators the power to do things like limit the number of jobs running at a time or grant preferential treatment to one group or another.

By using the "local universe" fork jobs are not actually submject to scheduling delays, unless the total number of allowed fork jobs of a given type is exceeded.

For details on setup and configuration, and how to replace the default fork queue with the managed fork queue we refer to the VDT 1.3.10 release notes on 
<a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.10/notes/Globus-ManagedFork-Setup.html">managed fork</a>.

Everything you'd want to know is described there.
In particular, we strongly recommend to use the following setting to make sure 
the Condor grid monitor is not adversely affected by managed fork.

<pre> START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20 || GridMonitorJob == TRUE </pre>
