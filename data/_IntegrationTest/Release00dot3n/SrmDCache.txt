---+!!<nop>SRM dCache

%STARTINCLUDE%

---++ Introduction

For information on dCache, see [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache documentation]].

---++ Hardware/Software Requirements

There is no official list of supported platforms for dCache. 

Java 1.4 or 1.5 must be present. 

A <nop>PostgreSQL installation is needed. Version 8.0 is the "required" version. Though the latest dCache will run with 7.4, future versions may not. 

<nop>PostgreSQL 7.3 is known to not work. If you need to install Postgres, see PostgresInstallRPMS.

The software installation of pnfs and dCache only takes about 40 MB, but the database for a very large number of files can consume several gigabytes.
