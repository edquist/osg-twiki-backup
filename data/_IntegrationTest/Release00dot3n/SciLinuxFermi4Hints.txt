---++Introduction
This section is meant to give tips for installing OSG 0.4.0/VDT 1.3.9a with Scientific Linux Fermi version 4.
Our tests were made on Scientific Linux Fermi 4.2. i386 version.  From VDT talk at 
integration workshop, PRIMA is not ready for the 64-bit version so we didn't test the x86_64 version 
---++Pacman, VDT
It was not necessary to use a -pretend-platform option with Pacman 3.15 which is required 
for VDT 1.3.8 anyway.  Also VDT did not burp and claim to be an unsupported platform, recognized
us as RHEL4 automatically
---++Packages needed
The first few times our installation failed due to missing linux rpms in what was a very 
sparse Farms workgroup install.  We had to add the following rpms with "yum install"
which
gcc 
gcc-g++
compat-libstdc++-33
autoconf
automake
compat-libcom_err-33
