---++Introduction

The Monitoring and Information Services framework for Open Science Grid is a complex array of multiple implementation of a variety of service aspects. This overview tries to describe an conceptual framework for OSG MIS, but it likely does not map cleanly onto a service decomposition. The current situation is an ensemble of a number of local tools for monitoring managing resources, some cataloging and monitoring tools used by various VOs and some attempts at general framework. There are user constituencies of all of these and a recognition that consolidation on a common framework and agreed set of interface points is desireable. We will not have that framework and interface definition agreed before OSG 0.2 deployment, but that is one of the things being worked as a development goal for future release(s).

One decomposition of the MIS framework comes up with the following functional components:
	* Service Catalog: contain a list of services and information about those services
	* Information Collection: processes run on the service to collect information about the service
	* Service Local Information Repository: a cache on the service to store the results of info collection
	* Service Information Query: a mechanism for querying information about a service
	* Service Validation: a test that a service meets minimal functional specifications
	* Service Status Monitoring: monitoring the recent/current status of a service
	* Service Usage Accounting: recording usage of services

The sections below describe each of these components in more detail as well as discussions of current implementations and suggestions for future development.
