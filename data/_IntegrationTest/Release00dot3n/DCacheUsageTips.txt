---+DCache Upage Guidlines
---++Introduction
The following tips for !DCache usage were supplied by David Berg at FNAL. 

---+++File Sizes
Bigger is better.

There is a breakpoint at 8 GB, but the only real limit is the size of
the tape (200 GB). The usual configuration is for files less than 8 GB;
we have to configure things a little different for larger files. If
possible, files should be at least 1 GB. Anything smaller than 100 MB
is very inefficient.

---+++Directories
Keep them a reasonable size.

Like nfs, pnfs directories should be held to about 1000 files; 2000 is
the recommended maximum. Also, because pnfs is really a database, not
a true file system, please do not use pnfs space as a file catalog by
doing frequent 'ls -l' commands, or 'find' commands, or the equivalent
thru ftp. These can so load the pnfs server that all users suffer
degraded response.
