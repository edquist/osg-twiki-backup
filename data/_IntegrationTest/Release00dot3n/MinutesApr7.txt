---+++ Application Validation report from Michael Thomas
<verbatim>
Here is the application validation report for this morning's meeting:

The icons in the site validation table have changed.  There is now an
icon for acceptable failures.

Atlas, Grase, SDSS, and Gadu have not started validating yet, but have
confirmed that they will start soon.

I thought CDF had started its validation but I can't find any validation
results in my email.  I'll follow up with Frank W. to confirm.

Nanohub and GROW have experienced a lot of authentication failures. 
Sites should work with these VOs directly to try to work through the
authentication problems.

CMS validates on most sites.  They fail to validate on a few due to
incompatibilities with the CMS software and the site's kernel.  A couple
of other sites don't have outbound network connectivity from the worker 
nodes.  These sites (Purdue, BNL, Ligo) should verify that they are
correctly setting GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP to FALSE if they
don't allow outbound network connections.

We need as many sites as possible to install VDT 1.3.10b, and to have
all VOs revalidate against at least a couple of VDT 1.3.10b sites.  We
really need STAR, CMS, and ATLAS to revalidate on 1.3.10b to let us know
that the srmcp and globus-url-copy problems have been fixed to their
satisfaction.  Let me when move to 1.3.10b so that I can update the 
validation table appropriately. 

If anyone installs the managed fork queue, please update the validation
table to indicate this.  We need a volunteer to run tests against the  
managed fork queue at sites that have it enabled.
