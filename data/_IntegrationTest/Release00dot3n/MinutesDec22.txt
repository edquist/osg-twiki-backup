   * Discussion of how to support Gridex.
   * Gridex cert as part of the iVDGL VO? Gridex application has to run at a lower priority.

   * Needs a policy page, etc., and a registration for the VO.  Jeff will do this today.
   * Expect by Jan 4-5, a new package to be delivered.  Production VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo support centers will need to be advised.
