---++Introduction

VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's have a number of responsibilities in OSG for organizing their work and their use of the Grid. The most fundamental of these is to maintain the list of their members and what roles they may play withing the organization. Within OSG, the method of maintaining this information is through a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service.  A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service provides two functionalities:  it provides a list of DN's of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo members for use in creating a gridmapfile, and it provides an attribute service where it creates signed attributes asserting that the bearer can play the specified role within the VO.  

The Privilege Project has bundled a number of components to help in setting up and maintaining a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service and other components to utilize the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes.  A detailed description of all of the elements and how they relate can be found at http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/.

---++Recommendations

We recommend that all VOs update to this release's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service if they are running a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS version earlier than XXX. This solves a number of potential interoperability problems as well as provides the option of using roles within the VO. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo managers will need to use either the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-Admin interfaces or the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS service to maintain the data within the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS database.

VOs that desire to use role-based authorization need to distribute the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS client tools to their users and teach them how to use them (eg. what the roles are within the VO, etc.). Users need to attach the attributes they wish to assert to their proxy by using the voms-proxy-init command. This command is used to contact the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server and extend the grid proxy with the user's attributes.
This information must be presented with the user's request in order for services to make a role-based decision.

Sites wishing to use VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership and roles to do uid mapping (for example, to use a pool of accounts), need to install the PRIMA modules (from the Privilege project) on their gatekeeper and one <a href="http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/">GUMS</a> server per site.
The PRIMA module parses the attributes and passes them to the GUMS server for mapping to a local userid.   Sites that do not wish to support attribute-based decisions may still find GUMS useful as a 
centrally maintained gridmap file.

---++Strategic Direction

Gridmapfiles represent a large portion of the current grid site maintenance. If all users can obtain VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes as part of their grid proxy, then sites receiving requests for service will get reliable statements of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership embedded in the requester's proxy. If a site can map all VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo members onto a single local userid, or use GUMS to manage userid assignment from a pool of local accounts, it does not need to maintain a gridmap for that VO.
