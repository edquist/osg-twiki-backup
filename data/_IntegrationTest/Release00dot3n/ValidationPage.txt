---+++ Notes

I am having an inconsistent reporting of site information in MonALISA. Under the Statistics - VO Jobs View the report is listing the number of jobs I submitted correctly. That is when I submit 10 CMS jobs, with 4 running and 6 idle the report correctly displays that information. However under my site report http://madman.uits.indiana.edu:8888/display?page=i&farm=UCSanDiegoITB3.1&pTime=1+day the current running jobs and running job graphs are blank. Are these two reports getting their information from different locations? -- Main.TerrenceMartin - 30 Nov 2005
