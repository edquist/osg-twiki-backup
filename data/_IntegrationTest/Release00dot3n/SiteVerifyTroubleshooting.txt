---++Introduction
This section provides some hints on troubleshooting problems identified in the site verification process using the <b>site_verify.pl</b> script.

---++Authentication (running a job on the gatekeeper fork queue)
The authentication verification is checking  to see if you can run a job on your gatekeeper by executing on the fork queue.  

Prequisites:
	* You need a grid proxy as a prerequisite and therefore your certificate credentials..
	* You need the subject (DN) of your credentials in the /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile showing the assignment to an established Unix account on your gatekeeper.
		 <verbatim>
		  "Your_DN"  unix_account
		 </verbatim>

The script will execute:
<verbatim>
	  globus-job-run {your-gate-keeper}/jobmanager-fork  /bin/hostname
</verbatim>
<b>PASS:</b> the exit status will be zero and the host name of the gatekeeper node will be displayed..

<b>FAIL:</b>
	1. 
	2.
