---++Introduction

Validations from the February 2005 ITB workshop.  The main validation page is ValidationPageRel01.

---++VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Validation
The following table summarizes use of proxy certificates on the common grid infrastructure.
   * http://www.hep.anl.gov/gfg/ppdg/proxy-compare-grid3-osg.html

---++Core Infrastructure Validation with Site Verify
The SiteVerify script (site_verify.pl) was developed by Craig Prescott.  The site_verify.pl script can be downloaded from 

<tt>
$ wget http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify.pl .
</tt>

It requires a valid grid proxy and the globus client software in the PATH. You can run it as regular user as follows:

<tt>
$ cd /opt/osgdev/
$ . setup.sh
$ cd -
$ grid-proxy-init
$ perl site_verify.pl --host=$GKHOST
</tt>

with $GKHOST being any of the gatekeepers advertised in GridCat, http://www.ivdgl.org/osg-int/gridcat/index.php?whichmap=us.

It first does some basic connectivity tests and checks for a globus gatekeeper and gridftp server, and then tests all basic globus services like globus-job-run, gridftp, all the advertised jobmanagers, the host certificate and the grid-mapfile, the existence of site env vars and the directories they point to, the advertised installed software, as well as checks for MDS, Ganglia, and MonALISA. 
Common problems are authentication failures because of missing DN entries in the grid-mapfile, globus and gridftp failures because of firewall issues and/or tcp wrapper denials, unknown paths to (Condor and "remote scheduler") binaries, GRIS not running, or permission/existence problems on $DATA, $TMP, and/or $APP.  In addition, a jobmanager-condor is usually created whether or not condor is used as a remote scheduler or not; for sites which do not use condor, this produces a 'condor : NOT WORKING' result when testing the status of the remote schedulers.  For the purposes of the ITB workshop, any failure of site_verify.pl to probe the remote batch system were deemed tolerable, as site_verify.pl's methods for doing this aren't yet completely robust.

---++CDF Application Validations

The CDF VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server has been updated to allow participation by  interested CDF institutions in the ITB and related OSG activities.    The CDF VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server is in the  ITB list.
At present, all components pass, but the batch system (PBS based on Torque and Maui under Rocks 3.3) is having trouble starting.  We were not able to find instructions for using the Condor system that came with the ITB installation (OSG 0.1.2, VDT 1.3.2), so have not used that as an alternative.
Next we plan to install GUMS and give the system a thorough test.  Note that the cluster on which this was installed has a full implementation of SAM and of the CDF experiment software.

---++US ATLAS Application Validations
ATLAS is validating the OSG ITB using the Capone workload management system used
for production of DC2 and Rome production.

---++USCMS Application Validations
---+++Validation Summary
USCMS is validating the OSG ITB using the MOP application.
   * A summary is available here: http://tier2.phys.ufl.edu/itb-site-verify/cms-mop-and-osg-itb.20050224.html

---+++General Validation Goals
We set out the following goals during the ITB workshop:

   1. Get MOP to read site configurations from GridCat
   2. Get MOP to use a prepackaged srmcp for file transfers.
   3. Use MOP to install software on FNAL_CMST1_TEST site
   4. Use MCPS/MOP to run MC jobs on FNAL_CMST1_TEST
   5. Use MOP to install software on another site
   6. Use MCPS/MOP to run MC jobs on that other site

   * Goals 1 and 2 were completed successfully.  Craig has made the changes and checked in the code to CVS on a special ITB branch.  Some trouble was encountered when trying to deploy prepackaged srmcp to sites that did not have it. We basically chose to distribute srmcp with the jobs for the duration of the ITB testing, but we found out that MOP did not handle the grid proxy correctly to use srmcp.  This was debugged and corrected.
   * Goal 3 was not completed.  There remained at the time of last trial a problem with the FNAL_CMST1_TEST configuration, and we chose to work with Florida in the meantime.
   * Goal 4 was not completed, basically for the same reason.
   * Goal 5 was completed.  CMKIN_4_0_1 CMS Application software was successfully deployed to the UF ITB site using MOP.  This was also being attempted at the time of writing for UBuffalo.
   * Goal 6 was completed.  A job was submit and run on the UF ITB site using  MCRunjob/MOP.  However, since the MCPS expert was ill during the last two days of the workshop, we fell back on the old MCRunjob to create the jobs.

---+++Next steps
   1. Reconfigure and/or revalidate the FNAL_CMST1_TEST site and try to submit jobs there.  (This may be done already, but we were unaware at the time of writing.)
   2. Submit jobs using MCPS.  This was tried briefly with the feverish MCPS expert, but there were some aspects of configuration that were not generally understood.  We will try again tomorrow.


---++fMRI
---+++Validation Summary

We have begin installation of our software suite starting with AIR. This package is installed with Pacman using a GridCat based script called ginstall.

The following sites have been validated with a working install:
   * IU_iuatlas
   * Caltech-OSG
   * FNAL-DDS
   * LIGO-CIT-OSG
   * ANL_HEP
   * UFlorida-IGT
   * UBuffalo-CCR-ITB
   * BNL_OSG_Test1

These do not have correct permissions on $app:
   * UCSD-OSGINT
<tt>
drwxrwxr-x    4 root     users        4096 Mar 10 10:17 /data/app/
</tt>

This site cannot connect back to my HTTP server:
   * BNL_OSG_Test1
<tt>

--13:43:44--  http://grid.dartmouth.edu/pacman/pacman-2.121.tar.gz
  (try: 4) => `-'
Connecting to grid.dartmouth.edu[129.170.30.204]:80... failed: Connection timed out.
Retrying.

</tt>

These do not accept my certificate:
   * TTU-TESTWULF
   * fnpcg_fnal_gov
   * FNAL_CMST1_TEST
   * OUHEP_ITB
   * UC_Teraport_OSG_ITB
   * UC_ATLAS_OSG_ITB
   * DUKE-HEP
   * IU_WALLABY


---++OSG Utilities
---+++Grid Certificate Tools
The grid certificate tools (cert-scripts package in VDT) were partially tested and an issue with the package layout in VDT (cert-check-time does not have default location for .awk scripts) was uncovered. Subsequent to the workshop a fix was made and it should work with default locations in VDT 1.3.3.
 
---+++OSG Shutdown Script
Ed May provided a script to shutdown running grid processes before doing a fresh installation of the OSG services. Note that a backup of a few files is made for safety. Below is the script.

<verbatim>
cat >FilesFor-gridFiles <<EOF
/etc/hosts
/etc/hosts.allow
/etc/hosts.deny
/etc/services
/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper
/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp /mnt/disk1/grid3/app/etc/grid3-locations.txt
