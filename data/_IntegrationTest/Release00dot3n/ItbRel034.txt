---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.3.4, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). It is based on [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.9/index.html][VDT 1.3.9a]]. There are two deployment options - a fully web services based installation, and one which installs the pre-web services Globus 4.0 which is important to many VO's for backwards compatiblity and migration.  

	* See previous release description for historical issues: ItbRel031.

---++ Validation and Work Plan
Descriptions of validation exercises of both applications and services using ITB release 0.3.4.  
  
	* The ITB "homepage" for the current release is IntegrationTestbed.  (*Site admins: go here to register your site.*)
	* OSGCEInstallGuide is the working set of instructions.
	* Descriptions of validations of the ITB 0.3 series of testbeds are located at the * ValidationPage. *

	* OSGCEInstallGuide (for site admins)
	* LocalStorageRequirements (general reference)
	* LocalStorageConfiguration (for site admnistrators)
	* LocalStorageUse (for users)


---+++For VDT 

	* Known problems in VDT 1.3.9, [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.9/problems.html][here]]


---+++ For !MonALISA


---+++ For !GridCat

	If you are a new ITB site, don't forget to follow instructions on the IntegrationTestbed twiki web for
registering your site.


---+++ For GIP

Please discuss with Main.AnandPadmanabhan validation for GIP (see further GenericInformationProviders).

---+++ For Storage Issues


---+++ For OSG Attributes


---+++For !MDS/GRIS
	* Main.JohnWeigand (12/1/05): In the /etc/init.d/gris start script, the  check that the startup is successful (check of $?) will never work.  The 'su' is the only comand that will return a failure.  To verify success/failure, you need to 'ps' and 'grep' for grid_info_daemon.
	* Main.HorstSeverini (12/1/05): Why does 'ldapsearch -x' (anonymous bind) still work? I thought we decided back in February at the first OSG integration meeting that we were going to turn that off and only allow authenticated access?


---+++ For !GridEx


---++ OSG Compute Element (CE) Description
The OSG CE installation has two paths with this version.  ITB cache contents may be inspected [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/][here]].

| *Pre-Web Services* |  *Web Services* |
| osg-0.3.4 | osg-0.3.4-ws |


These packages deliver the following components (If you want both, install osg-0.3.4 first, then in the same install directory install 0.3.4-ws. Detailed instructions should be in OSGCEInstallGuide):
 
|  *Pre-Web Services* | *Web Services* | *Description* |
|  osg-auto-1.3.9  | osg-auto-1.3.9.-ws | provides a VDT questions setup, osg-version |
|  VDT_139	|  VDT_139-ws  | components from the VDT 1.3.9a package |
|  grid3-schema  || Grid3 Schema for GRIS |
|  osg-grid3-info-prov  || configure-osg and grid3 information files |
|  OSG:vo-0.2.1  || OSG VO's |
|  OSG:gums:cron  || Fix for Client Gums installation |
|  srm-cp  || SRM client tool |
|  MIS-CI  || Monitoring interface |
|  osg-gip  || Generic information provider |
|  site-verify  || Site Verification |


---++ OSG Client 

There is a package of client tools available separately:

=pacman -get iVDGL:osg-client=

At the moment this is just VDT-Client (Condor-G, VDS, etc) from the current release of VDT.  We keep this as
a distinct package in case we need to add something in between VDT releases or tools perhaps not included 
in VDT.

---++ OSG Worker Node Client

This package is to be visible to worker nodes - either installed on the local disk, or through a NFS filesystem mount.

	* Twiki page with description: WorkerNodeClient


---++ Core MIS
Description of the CoreMIS infrastructure to be used, MIS-CI Version 0.3.0.  The Core MIS will be configured by the configure_misci.sh script as a post installation step.


---++ Information Services

More information about the information services in this release are available here:

	* OsgInformationService Overview 
		* GLUESchema 1.2
		* GenericInformationProviders (GIP)
		* Grid3Schema
		* Grid3InformationProvider


---++ Privilege and VO Services Infrastructure

Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release.  From before, the PRIMA callout for extended proxy certificates has been fixed to match the VOMS usage. Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization is supported too. 


---++ Discovery and Job Monitoring Services
	* DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.  This should be performed by anyone who wishes to run a local discovery service registry.  The Discovery service will be used to catalog the VOMS and SRM servers on the OSG.
	* DiscoveryServicePublication instructions for VOMS and DRM service providers.  This should be run by VOMS server administrators in order to get their VOMS service registered with the Discovery Service.
	* See VDT 1.3.9a


---++ Site Validation

The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the OSG pacman cache in this release.
