---+++ System or Cluster Already Setup including a functioning batch system
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should likewise previously be installed and configured. If you intend to use the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] system, that can be installed with pacman from the VDT cache before this grid middleware.  It 
is strongly recommended to install Condor in a different directory
than your main CE installation. 

To pull Condor from the VDT cache, use:

<pre>pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_140_cache:Condor</pre>

The installation will ask for local storage space for 3 separate purposes: 
   * OSG applications
   * data
   * temporary caching.

For details on the storage use and configuration, please reference the section on 
[[LocalStorageConfiguration050][Local Storage Configuration]] in this guide.

---+++ Preserving a pre-existing Condor installation?
If you have installed Condor as your batch queuing system, you are required to set two environment variables so the Condor path is correctly configured. 

   * *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION* - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. _/opt/condor_). The Condor _bin/_, _bin_, _etc/_, _lib/_... directories should be directly under this location.
   * *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG* (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is _$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config_.

This will result in:
   * VDT middleware services pointing to appropriate locations in your external Condor installation.

For example, if you wish to preserve a Condor installed in the standard location,
<pre>
  $ export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT
</pre>
will suffice (provided $CONDOR_ROOT is set, per the usual Condor config).

---+++ Compilers
The VDT installation presumes that you have a working C and C++ 
compiler as part of the install.  The gcc and g++ that come as
rpms with most Linux distributions are fine.  (This should be checked again, g++ was 
only needed for MIS-CI, now deprecated.  S. Timm 10/12/2006).

---+++ Network setup?
It is assumed that your hardware has a working network connection through which packages may be retrieved and from which services may contact your system. The full OSG CE package is ~700MB.

---++++!! Firewall?
If your installation is inside a site firewall, has a host firewall (ipchains/iptables), or is using TCP wrappers (=/etc/hosts.{allow,deny}=), you'll need to review the 
[[Trash.Trash/Trash/IntegrationCEFireWalls050][Firewall Document]] of this guide and arrange for appropriate Internet access.

---++++!! Time synchronization (NTP) 
Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of eg. proxy lifetimes. 

---++++!! Reverse name lookups (DNS)
For the middleware to correctly function both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system.


---+++ Previous OSG or Grid3 Installations
If there is a _previous installation_ of the OSG or Grid3 environment or other Globus middleware, please _stop the processes_ which are currently running. This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), !MonALISA and other services configured to start upon initialization on your system. Also, if you've sourced the $VDT_LOCATION/setup.[c]sh on your previous VDT install, just log out and log back in to clear out your environment.

More information is provided in the
[[OSGShutdownGuide050][OSG Shutdown Guide]].

---+++ Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs for OSG 
UNIX user accounts need to be created by the system administrator for the VOs.  
You will need to create at least one local user account (with the appropriate configuration) for each Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to which you wish to provide resources.  The uid and name of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later in the installation, the following default accounts are assumed for examples in this document.  Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's are frequently added to the OSG, 
any new Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's not mentioned here will appear in $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt

The accounts are: 
   * cdf 
   * fermilab 
   * fmri 
   * gadu 
   * grase 
   * ivdgl 
   * mis 
   * sdss 
   * star 
   * usatlas1 
   * uscms01 
   * ligo 
   * sam 
   * samgrid 
   * dosar 
   * des 
   * glow 
   * grow 
   * gridex 
   * nanohub 
   * geant4 
   * i2u2 
   * mariachi 
   * osg 
   * osgedu 
   * nwicg 
   * ops 
   * gugrid
   * gpn
   * compbiogrid

In addition, it is necessary to have a "globus" uid/gid. Verify that you as root
can su to globus before the installation.  This is used for part of the Web services installation.
---+++ Do you have a user certificate?
You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests.  If you don't have a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy (grid-proxy-init, etc), contact your <a href="http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php">Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Support Center</a>.  
Or follow the instructions [[CEInstallGuide050#Get_a_personal_grid_certificate][below]]
under Configuring Public Key Infrastructure.
