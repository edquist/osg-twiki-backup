---++ Introduction

This page is a running list of things to do regarding the set of activities for determining ITB 0.3's composition and validation. The ITB release descriptions are [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/WebHome#ITB_Releases][here]].

---++ To do list (%RED% 10/27/05 %ENDCOLOR%)
	
	* Create an ITB 0.3 validation page (%GREEN% done %ENDCOLOR%)
	* Update the "main testbed page" (%GREEN% done %ENDCOLOR%)
	* Need to test the web services version of OSG-0.3.0 using the gt4 testing scripts from Stu. Where are these located?
	* New GIP package from Laurence needs to be intergrated into Shoawan's package. 
	* Need to develop release description for various install options for ITB 0.3.0 which allows: (%GREEN% done %ENDCOLOR%)
		* a web-services gram option only for the CE
		* a pre-web services gram option for the CE
		* both services made availiable for the CE
	* Prepare pacman packages for these, and minimal set of instructions  (%GREEN% done %ENDCOLOR%)
		* Start with ItbRel030 page.
	* Install this on several ITB sites and report progress ( *ready for installation* )
		* IU: ITB 0.3.0 pre-WS
		* UC: ITB 0.3.0 pre-WS
		* FNAL 
		* TTU: ITB 0.3.0 WS
		* PU
		* BNL
	* Validation exercises with these sites. *Please store results on the ValidationPage for reference/documentation.*
	* Identify GridCat dependencies, if any, for the configurations above.
	* Comment on the LocalStorageRequirements document.


---+++!! Issues to resolve
	* Concerns about GRAM client interfaces, requirements for Gridftp on the client, etc. See Stu's [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0510B&L=OSG-INT&P=R6913&I=-3][email remark]] on this.
	* What do we do with the generic IP's with MDS4?  Wait for ISI to translate ldiff to xml?  Bifurcate into pre and web services CEs. Still being discussed MIS. ITB is ready to try out approaches.
