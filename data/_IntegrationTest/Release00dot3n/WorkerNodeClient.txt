---++ Introduction

This is a minimal set of executables that need to be made available to the worker nodes in a Compute Element.

It may be installed on a shared filesystem, or locally on each worker node (as long as the path on each worker node is the same).

You will be prompted for this path when running the =configure-osg.sh= script on the gatekeeper in order to set
the =$OSG_GRID= variable.

---++ Installation
Install with <Br>
=pacman -get OSG:osg-wn-client-0.4.0=
---++Contents

	* http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/osg-wn-client-0.4.0

---++References

	* For reference, the OSG cache directory: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/.
	* For reference, the VDT 1.3.9 cache directory: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_139_cache/.

---++Alternative Viewpoint and Approach

	* Installation of the worker node client package does imply maintenance of the certificates that it installs.  As an alternative, it is possible to simply rsync the installed full osg installation to the worker nodes, and independently of whether this option is chosen, use rsync to keep the certificates up to date.  
	* Doing anything automatically on the worker nodes requires care.  An example script that looks to see what worker nodes on a cluster using pbsnodes is attached to this page.  It can be edited or replaced with a more general version to match your specific cluster conditions.  Note that the example script does not use the batch system itself, but uses a feature of the local batch scheduler to avoid trying to push certificates to worker nodes that are down and to build a list of operating nodes to receive the update.
	* This issue deserves further discussion.
