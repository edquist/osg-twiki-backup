---++ Overview
The OSG Integration Project is the set of deliverables and milestones organized and effort-loaded within the OSG project to provide rapid, iterative, first-level integration of VDT and other components of the OSG environment, providing feedback to the VDT team and other service/tool developers.  The activity works witin the OSG release and deployment process, crudely:
   *  ET --> VDT <--> VTB --> ITB --> OSG

The output of the VTB is:
   * A middleware systems-level specification and implied architecture of an OSG grid release.
   * Rapid feedback and spark testing of pre-VDT releases as deployed in grid systems.
   * First-pass functional testing of integrated services based on VDT software.
   * Provision/adoption of systems-level testing and validation frameworks
   * Validation and scalability tests
   * An ITB release candidate for deployment on the  full ITB for broad, pre-deployment testing and VO validation and sign-off.
   * A physical infrastructure to support all of the above.

---++ Site definitions and responsibilities
---+++ Components
The VTB will have a flexible and distributed infrastructure for hosting services required for OSG required systems tests.  VTB sites (A, B, C and G=GOC-hosted) will provide infrastructure and effort to host system elements comprising the VTB.  A preliminary set of VTB components include: 

   * CE_n: compute elements
      * CE services may be distributed over one or more hosts.
      * WN_n: worker node testing
   * SE_n: storage elements, n >= 1
      * This may be multiple servers depending on the OSG SE under test.  For example, a 
   * ES_n: edge service elements
   * CI_n: client interface hosts (client testing, job submission host, workload generator) 
   * VTB GUMS service host
   * VTB VOMS service host
   * VTB information service host
   * VTB resource selector/discovery host
   * VTB monitoring service host
   * VTB accounting service host

Some of these services may be combined on hosts.  In addition, we envision a multi-site VTB infrastructure monitor and configuration database to emulate a single site facility.
   * VTB facility monitor - providing web-visible feedback and monitoring data of combined services.
   * VTB configuration database
   * VTB metrics data and reduced performance results archival

---+++ Activities
   * Grid-packaging: preparation of pacman ITB release candidates for VTB components
