---+!!<nop>OSG ITB CE Install Guide

---++Introduction
This document is intended for site administrators responsible for OSG 
middleware installation and configuration. It is not meant as an all-inclusive install guide.  The instructions
assume the following Linux distributions:

	* Red Hat 9.0</li>

	* Red Hat 7.x
	* Red Hat 9.0
	* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
Installation may be successful with other Linux distributions, but they have not been tested.
distributions such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.x (x=3,4) and Rocks 3.x (x>=1)
The proposed installation and configuration method is based on <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/">Pacman</a>.  Pacman is a package manager like RPM or dpkg, but is able to work on and support multiple platforms.

---+++Conventions used
The installation and configuration method is based on <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/">Pacman</a>.  Pacman is a package manager like RPM or dpkg, but is able to work on and support multiple platforms.  Specific Pacman directions are given below, and in the pre-installation procedures.

	* <tt>monospaced text</tt> indicates terminal output 
	* <tt><b>bold monospaced text</b></tt> indicates terminal input (by the user)
	* <tt><i>monospaced text in italics</i></tt> indicates variable data that may differ on your installation
	* the <tt>&gt;</tt> prompt indicates commands that do not require a specific shell or root access
	* the <tt>#</tt> prompt indicates commands that require root access
	* the <tt>$</tt> prompt indicates sh- or bash-specific commands
	* the <tt>%</tt> prompt indicates csh- or tcsh-specific commands
	* the =#= prompt indicates commands that require root access

---++Pre-installation Checklist
---+++System or Cluster Already Installed
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should be likewise previously installed and configured, unless you intend to use the Condor system that will be installed with the VDT.	
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should be likewise previously installed and configured, unless you intend to use the Condor system that can optionally be installed with VDT.
---+++Preserving a pre-existing Condor installation
If you would like to preserve your Condor installationyou can setup the installer to recognize it by setting
two environment variables.  Doing so will produce the following effects:
	* Condor will be installed but not configured. 
	* The VDT middleware will point to the necessary locations in your external Condor installation.

To specify an external Condor installation you need to set the following two environment variables before starting the installation:
	* <b>VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION</b> - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. <i>/opt/condor</i>). The Condor <i>bin/</i>, <i>sbin/</i>, <i>etc/</i>, <i>lib/</i>... directories should be directly under this location.
	* <b>VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG</b> (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is <i>$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config</i>.

==$ export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT==
</pre>
