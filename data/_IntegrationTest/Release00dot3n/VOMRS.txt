---+!!<nop>Virtual Organization Management Registration Service
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Overall (brief) description of the service, and expected duration of the service within the ITB
The Virtual Organization Management Registration Service (!VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS) is a service that provides the means for registering members of a Virtual Organization, and coordination of this process among the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and grid resource administrators. For sites using VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS to maintain VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership, !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS would be a replacement for the web user interface (web UI) functionality of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS. 

!VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS consists of:
   * a database to maintain user registration and institutional information, 
   * a web user interface (web UI) and web services for input of data into the database and manipulation of that data, 
   * and a multitasking server that performs checks for membership and certificate authority expiration dates, event notifications, and optional membership synchronization with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.

!VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS is already in use by US ATLAS and US CMS.

---++Description of dependencies and interactions with other services
Dependencies:
   * EDG Trust Manager software to perform authentication
   * !MySql version 4.15+, but not version 5.
   * Tomcat4

The only OSG service that !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS interacts with is VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.  !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS would replace the web UI functionality of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.  !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS is designed to synchronize basic membership, group and role information with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS using the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS admin API.  The edg-voms-admin jar file that contains the API’s is self contained in !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS libraries.

---++Resources required -- are clients/agents/info providers etc. to be installed on all sites?
The !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS server should be installed only on the sites that host a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership service such as VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS. 

The !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS client would be installed on the node if the web services functionality will be used.

---++What are the server requirements (is a central discovery server /repository needed/provided, etc)?
The only discovery service that may be useful would be to provide the url to the !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS service for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership.

---++How is it packaged?
The rpms and pacman cache are available for download from http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/downloads.html

---++Provide installation and configuration instructions
Installation instructions are provided in package documentation directory
$VOMRS_LOCATION_DIR/doc/INSTALL. A configuration script located in $VOMRS_LOCATION_DIR/sbin/vomrs_configure allows an administrator to configure a specific !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS. The configuration file template (vomrs.xml.template) and xml schema (vomrs.xsd) can be found in $VOMRS_LOCATION_DIR/etc/cfg directory.
The overall overview of !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS and the User Guide is provided in http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/pdf/vox.pdf.

---++Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one 
understanding everything is working properly? Are all required 
functionality tests successful?
Currently there is no comprehensive test suite that exercises all available functionality.

Upon installation, an initial check for of !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS can be performed by the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrator by accessing a !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS installation via web browser (https://hostname:8433/vo_path/vo_name/vomrs) or by executing $VOMRS_LOCATION_DIR/client/bin/vomrs_soapclient command (see executing $VOMRS_LOCATION_DIR/client/doc/README_CLIENT). 

When a !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS server is started, the status of the !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS Server can be checked by executing “$VOMRS_LOCATION_DIR/etc/init.d/vomrs status” command.  This, however, only validates is the server has not crashed. The more information can be found in  service’s logs.
 
---++Scalablity tests - what are the expectations in terms of 
performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful 
integration.
The !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS is not a critical service. It is only used for initial member registration and then occasionally for member status or personal information update. We didn’t perform and stress tests in order to estimate the degradation of the system. The average load on the server should be pretty low except when full periodic synchronization (level #3) is with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is turned on and update period is short. 

There are 17 !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS installation on fermigrid2 node at Fermilab and so far we have not seen any performance problem.
