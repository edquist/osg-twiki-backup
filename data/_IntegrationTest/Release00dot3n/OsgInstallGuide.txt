---++ Introduction

OSG maintains a software cache with reference implementations of the OSG "standard" services. For Release 0.2, there are four standard services: ComputeElements (CE), StorageElements (SE), VOMembershipServices (VOMS), and DiscoveryServices (DS). The standard service names link to definitions of the service interfaces and requirements generally independent of implementation. The links below connect to instructions on how to deploy the default configuration of the OSG reference implementations. This is a good starting point for new participants and is commonly used for OSG production services.

---++ How to configure a VO Membership Service

Integration.VoAdmins contains the current information on how to deploy a VO Membership Service. The VOs which you wish to service must have a VO Membership Service configured before you'll be able to provide any services to them. If you are a new VO, this is the place to start.

---++ How to configure a Compute Element

Integration.OSGCEInstallGuide contains the current information on how to deploy a Compute Element. A Compute Element is by far the most common OSG standard service (and was the only standard service on Grid3) and you may find lingering documentation that talks about OSG deployment and assumes you are deploying a Compute Element. Please fix those as you find them !!

There are several different configuration options for a Compute Element depending on which authorization methods you wish to use. We'll document the basics and point you to extensions that you're likely to want to investigate once you get running (or right away for the more adventurous).

---++ How to configure a Storage Element

There is no reference implementation of a Storage Element supported at this time. 

---++ How to configure a Discovery Service

Integration.DiscoveryServiceInstallation contains the current information on how to deploy a Clarens Discovery Service.  OSG is in an intermediate state with regards "standardization" of a Discovery Service. For Compute Elements we continue to use a single, central GridCat instance as our catalog for discoverying CEs. This maintains compatibility with tools used on Grid3, but has a large central operations requirement and is not likely the model we'll use moving forward. The Clarens Discovery service is a first instance of a dynamic discovery service, but is built for Web Services only. We have documented how to register SRM and INFN VOMS servers with the Claren Discovery service, but have not defined required interfaces. This release is intended as an experiment to determine how such a service should work and to resolve how to discover non Web Services based services.
