---++ App Validation on ITB 0.3.7 (Michael)

   * Rob Q thinks that if we would need at least 5 days before the release date. Therefore get everything provisioned by Friday, May 5, and then announce following Monday, Monday May 8.
   * No updates on managed-fork queue testing; only Caltech has tested?
   * srm-client - no report; Neha will perforrm a test on three ITB 0.3.7 sites.
   * Gridcat = most sites are green.
   * BDII validation by Shaowen.
   * Monalisa - only one site not showing up.
   * Gridex - everything working.
   * Fermi-VO - no updates to testing
   * LIGO has checked off on the release
   * So has SDSS (basiic workflow works; problems on a couple of sites-BNL_ITB_Test1 and TTU) and CMS.
   * ATLAS - troubleshooting still on ITB sites - not completely validated in the Panda monitoring. Needs to inspect the logfiles.  Expects to be finished by the end of the week.
   * CDF checks off on the release
   * No updates from D0, GADU, or Nanohub.
   * GROW - Erik Shook has validated on ~ half the sites.  Few sites with authentication failures.

---++ Documentation Review (Rob)

   * Report from Frank that all his pieces are complete.
   * Most reviews have been checked off.
   * Still need workernode client (make this as a documentation change only, a choice for sys admins, see notes from last meeting.) and OSG CE authorization.
   * Will start moving over the checked off review.

---++ Update on MDS (Michael for Burt)

   * Have not received an updated tarball from VDT yet.
   * Current plan: Ship MDS with 0.4.1 as is, distribute as tarballs for validation by CMS, and then provide to everyone else as a patch to OSG 0.4.1.


---++ AOB 

   * Review timeline:
      * Provisioning starts beginning of next week.
      * OSG 0.4.1 release May 5.
