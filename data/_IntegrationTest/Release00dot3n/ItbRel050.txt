---++Introduction
Planning and discussion for OSG services for release 0.6.0.  The corresponding ITB release will be 0.5.0.

List of mandatory services:
<pre>
Storage Element
Basic transfer tools
Reliable file transfer service (classified as A/B by CMS and as A by ATLAS)
Compute Element
Workload management
VO Agents
Database Services
Information Systems
</pre>

	* Delay until October.  We don't have drivers from the VOs (need these).

---++ Planning Documents

	* January OSG consortium meeting slides on OSG 0.6.0 [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=340][here]].

---++ VO Requirements

We need an applications matrix for:
We need an applications matrix to discuss specific VO requirements for 0.6.0.
	* ATLAS
	* CMS
	* LIGO
	* CDF
   * Squid
need for next EB meeting July 10.

---++ Handling Incremental Upgrades

It is expected the upgrade to OSG 0.6.0 will need to be performed incrementally, not all sites upgrading at the same time, and perhaps upgrading their services one at a time.  This will additionally have implications on the ITB, but also for the deployed production OSG facility.


---++ Policy
	* Site policy templates
	* VO policy templates


---++ Compute Element

<pre>
AAA based on RBAC with certs from VOMS.
GLUE schema 1.2
Possibly extensions for storage
Version 2 not likely before LHC startup.
Plans for June 06:
No ws as part of baseline services in LCG
New RB using condor-c is part of this release. Not clear how exactly this will be deployed. Will figure this out between now and May!
Concern about interoperability!
Gt4 pre-ws -> ok
Gt4 ws
Condor-c
</pre>
