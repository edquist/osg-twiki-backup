---++Stopping the currently running daemons

The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down it will fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading:
Should stop condor daemons too if you are running the default personal condor that
comes with the install.
<ul>
  <li>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/gris stop
  <li>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/ML_SER stop	<b># (has to be done as user monalisa)  WHY? Root can kill this just fine, and monalisa service isn't running as user monalisa by default anyway  S. Timm</b>
</ul>

<p>Example session from doing this shutdown:</p>
<pre>
[root@mysite root]# /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
Stopping edg-crl-upgrade
[root@mysite root]# /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
Stopping edg-gridmapfile-upgrade: 
[root@mysite root]# /etc/init.d/gris stop
[root@mysite root]# su - monalisa
[monalisa@mysite monalisa]$ . /usr/local/grid/setup.sh
[monalisa@mysite monalisa]$ $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/ML_SER stop
Trying to stop MonaLisa ....STOPPED
Trying to stop emysqldb...OK
</pre>
