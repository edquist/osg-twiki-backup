---++Service Readiness Plan

Presenting a US CMS Tier-1 Storage Element to the OSG ITB.

<verbatim>

1) The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 
interface, with additions for implicit space reservation.

  The service will be available to all registered OSG VO's.


2) To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client . This is 
available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available 
and should probably be the version	deployed.)

3) The SE publishes information into Glue Schema V1.1 through the GIIS 
at	cmssrv14.fnal.gov (not completely functional yet
	 should be by March 18). (we have started to talk to Bockjoo about 
displaying this information as part of GridCAt)

4) the service will be tested by US CMS  using the srmcp client from  
fnkits.fnal.gov

5) The Contact  is  TBA (currently CMS-T1@fnal.gov)

6) Links to user documentation  

</verbatim>

http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/enstore/usingdcache.html#56262

<verbatim>

More complete documentation is at  http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/index.html

7)US CMS MOP uses this service and can be used as a test program on the 
ITB.
