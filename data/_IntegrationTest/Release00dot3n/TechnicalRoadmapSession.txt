---+!! Technical Roadmap Session Notes
%TOC%
---++ Introduction
Session notes for developing the OSG technical roadmap - [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/events/meetings/consmeeting0806/agenda.html][OSG Seattle Consortium]], August 22, 2006.   

---++ Straightforward Services
These are services that either exist and have been validated, or are expected to be ready on the timescale of OSG 0.6.0.   In some cases they will be optionally installed on OSG; very likely all these are non-contoversial, but lets discuss.

---+++ Uberftp
Request from ATLAS for data management.  To be included in osg-wn-client package.  This is already in ITB 0.5.0.  

---+++ wget
Its in osg-wn-client, useful for jobs to fetch software.

---+++ Squid
Introduced first by CDF, can be used for caching periodic CRL updates from compute nodes.  Other VOs will likely want to use for caching application tarballs.  
   * Already In VDT 1.3.11.
   * [[http://www.squid-cache.org/][Squid cache homepage]] - for more information
   * SquidReadinessPlan - originally supplied by Igor S.

---+++ CEMon 
Resource selection service introduced/driven by D0 and Samgrid.  Being tested presently in ITB and D0 sites.  More information:
   * [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/CEMonAndGIPInstallationNotes][Installation instructions]] for ITB v0.5.0
   * [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/ServiceReadiness][Service Readiness]]
   * ResourceSelection.GlueSchemaAndReSS 
   * http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php 

---+++ BDII
Berkeley index server, will be required in OSG 0.6.0, part of the general OSG information services proposal (see InformationServices.InfoServicesSessionAgenda). 
   * Do we need an Open LDAP.
   * BDII: http://lfield.home.cern.ch/lfield/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?area=bdii&page=documentation
   * GenericInformationProvider
   * http://scan.grid.iu.edu/ldap/index.html 
   * Glue Schema: http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/ 
   * OSG GIP: http://grow.its.uiowa.edu/research/gip/ 

---+++ glexec
Introduced/driven by CDF, Fermilab and OSG Security, provides authorization for glide-in jobs and other pilot-based production frameworks (eg. Panda for ATLAS). 
   * Under development, proceeding well.
   * Integration issues?
   * http://grid.pd.infn.it/cream/field.php?n=AndConf.Guide

---+++ WS Gram

---+++ VDS verification 
Introduced by LIGO and the VDS team, vds-verify is a site verification script which should be installed on headnodes in OSG 0.6.0.  Already in ITB 0.5.0. 

---+++ GRATIA accounting service
   * [[http://giis.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/AccountingReadinessPlan][Readiness plan]]
   * [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=130][OSG accounting requirements document]].

---++ Services and Discussions

---+++ Clarens
Exists but are there ways to use it more effectively?
   * DiscoveryServiceInstallation
   * http://clarens.sourceforge.net/ 

---+++ MDS
GT4 information services: how will these be used, by which VOs?
   * MDS4: http://www.globus.org/toolkit/mds/ 

---+++ ESF
Discuss how this will work - with workspace manager coming from VDT, XEN being installed separately.
  * Need a site deployment model and usage.
  * [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/EdgeServices/WebHome][Edge Services twiki]]

---+++ g-Lite client tools
   * See AtlasWishList06
   * gLite: http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite 

---+++ Storage
   * gPlazma authorization service - in time for OSG 0.6.0?
   * Registration of SRM-v1, SRM-v2 storage elements in OSG?


---++ LCG-OSG interoperability
As a grid responsibility, rather than a VO responsibility.
   * 10 min presentation by Ian Fisk on how CMS submits jobs transparently across OSG & LCG, and what they had to do to an OSG 0.4.1 site to make this happen. 10 min Q & A for Ian.
   * 10 min presentation by Leigh the current and 0.6.0 plans toward EGEE/WLCG Interoperability 
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG-EGEE-interop.ppt][OSG-EGEE-interop.ppt]]: talk

      

---++ Condor-C
What is the roadmap for deployment in EGEE?
   * 10 min presentation from somebody who knows what's going on with condor-c in EGEE/LCG (who?) This would include:
      * How does it work?
      * Information about deployment schedule, as best as that is known for LCG.
         * 18 months?
   * See Bob's talk on the gLite software stack: http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=458

---++ Headnode load issues
   * See Operations.SiteSession082006
   * [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=382][Document on NFS-lite]] - description of steps and procedures for removing NFS dependencies as developed at UCSD.

---++ Schedule for 0.6.0
   * What we know about the schedule: February 07?
