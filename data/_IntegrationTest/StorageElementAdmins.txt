---++ Introduction
This page contains how-to guides and other necessary information for setting up a Storage Element or testing a Storage Element Implementation.

*What is a Storage Element ?* 
		
		A SE on OSG is a node/cluster of nodes which

	* Satisfies OSG Requirements Integration.LocalStorageRequirements
	* Provides Storage Space.
	* Is accessible to applications running on OSG through either gridftp and/or srm interface. 
	* Has GIP setup and configured properly which publishes its information.
	* Has well-defined policy for cleanup and usage.
	* Is registered with OSG.

---++ Types of Storage Elements

---+++Gridftp-based File System

		A GridFTP based SE is simply a directory ($DATA) accessible via gridftp and srm interfaces.

		From OSG CE Install Guide: 
		"The data directory will be required to be shared from the head node (gatekeeper node) to each of the worker nodes. This will be the directory to which applications will write input and output data files for running jobs. This directory should be writable by all users. Users will be able to create sub-directories which are private, as provided by the filesystem. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per worker node."
	  [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/LocalStorageRequirements#DATA][Description of $DATA]]
---+++Srm/dCache

For information on dCache, see [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache documentation]].

---+++Srm/Drm

Documentation and manual for SRM/DRM v1.2.9 is available on http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist.
Support available through srm@lbl.gov.


---++ Setup of Storage Element (SE)

---+++ How to Setup SE based on Gridftp-based File System

This involves creating a data directory ($DATA) and mounting it on all worker nodes so the storage is accessible to applications running on that site via some environment variables.

---+++ How to Setup SE based on Srm/dCache
Srm/dCache is not directly supported by OSG please see dCache documentation at [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache documentation]].

---+++ How to Setup SE based on Srm/Drm
[[http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist/client/][Srm/Drm Installation and Configuration]]

---+++ How to Setup Generic Information Provider (GIP)
To configure this component, see the 
<a href="http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Provisioning/GenericInformationProviders">
Generic Information Providers</a> document in this guide.

---++ How to enable your applications to access Storage on OSG 
		[[Integration.LocalStorageUse][Access Storage on OSG]]

---++ How to Test SE Implementation
		!SRM-TESTER is available to test SRM based storage sites as well as popular file transfer protocol such as gsiftp, http or ftp, based storage sites. SRM-TESTER is integrated into the [[http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat/home/][GridCat]] and also available as a stand-alone tester. SRM-TESTER can be installed through VDT pacman, or downloadable from http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist.

The SRM Client Tools are an optional module in the OSG Cache. They are supported by the SRM-dCACHE team srm@lbl.gov.
