---++Introduction

The Discovery Service is a web service catalog for the OSG.  There are several ways to publish information into the Discovery Service.

---++ jClarens-Publisher

VDT 1.3.8 includes a new jClarens-Publisher package that provides some command line tools for publishing to and querying from any Discovery Service instance:

	* =bin/publish-voms-admin.sh= - A script to publish a voms admin server to the discovery service.  Run with =-h= for usage information.
	* =etc/publish-voms-admin.properties= - Site-specific settings for the VOMS server at the site.  This is read by the publish-voms-admin.sh script.
	* =bin/vomspublisher= - An /etc/init.d script for starting the voms publisher at boot time.
	* =bin/mkgridmapconf.sh= - script to generate an edg-mkgridmap.conf file from a list of VOMS admin services registered with the Discovery Service.
	* =bin/query.sh= - A script to query for any and all services, not just VOMS, that have been published to the Discovery Service.

	1. Modify =etc/publish-voms-admin.properties= with the site-specific settings.
	1. Modify the =publisher_home= setting in the =vomspublisher= script to point to the full directory path containing the publish-voms-admin.sh script.
	1. Copy =vomspublisher= to /etc/init.d and make the appropriate changes on your system to start/stop the service automatically.  RedHat and Fedora systems can use =chkconfig --add vomspublisher= followed by =chkconfig vomspublisher on= to set this up.
	1. Start the voms admin service publisher daemon using the /etc/init.d script.

---++ SRM/DRM

DRM includes support code for publishing the SRM service description to the Discovery Service.  Some configuration may be required.

---++ jClarens

Any service deployed in the jClarens grid service container will automatically be published to the Discovery Service.  This includes the Discovery Service itself as well as some utility services included with jClarens.

---++ MonALISA

It is possible, though entirely not recommended, to publish directly to the Discovery Service using the ApMon client libraries provided by MonALISA.  This mechanism requires that you have detailed knowledge about how jClarens interacts with MonALISA, so it is not recommeded or even described here.
