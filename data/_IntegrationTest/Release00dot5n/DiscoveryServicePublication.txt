---++Introduction

The Discovery Service is a web service catalog for the OSG.  There are several ways to publish information into the Discovery Service.

---++ jClarens-Publisher

VDT 1.3.8 includes a new jClarens-Publisher package that provides some command line tools for publishing to and querying from any Discovery Service instance.  This is not currently a required package for the CE install, so you will have to install this package separately with the following command:

<verbatim>
    pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_139_cache:jClarens-Publisher
</verbatim>

   * =bin/publish-voms-admin.sh= - A script to publish a voms admin server to the discovery service.  Run with =-h= for extended usage information.  When run with no arguments it will load the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and discovery service configuration from =etc/publish-voms-admin.properties=.
   * =etc/publish-voms-admin.properties= - Site-specific settings for the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server at the site.  This is read by the =publish-voms-admin.sh= script.
   * =bin/vomspublisher= - An /etc/init.d script for starting the voms publisher at boot time.
   * =bin/mkgridmapconf.sh= - script to generate an edg-mkgridmap.conf file from a list of Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS admin services registered with the Discovery Service.
   * =bin/query.sh= - A script to query for any and all services, not just Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, that have been published to the Discovery Service.

   1. Modify =etc/publish-voms-admin.properties= with the site-specific settings for the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.
   1. Copy =vomspublisher= to /etc/init.d and make the appropriate changes on your system to start/stop the service automatically.  RedHat and Fedora systems can use =chkconfig --add vomspublisher= followed by =chkconfig vomspublisher on= to set this up.
   1. Start the voms admin service publisher daemon using the /etc/init.d script.

---++ SRM/DRM

DRM includes support code for publishing the SRM service description to the Discovery Service.  To activate this feature, a site must add the following entries to their configuration file (dmr.rc or otherwise):

<verbatim>
wsg*ClarensURL=http://discover.gridservice.info/xmlrpc
wsg*ClarensVO=testVO
</verbatim>

Replace =testVO= with the name of the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo offering this DRM service.  Set the ClarensURL to the appropriate URL for the grid.  For example, the OSG production grid sites should use =https://osg-discovery.caltech.edu:8443/jclarens/xmlrpc=, while the OSG ITB grid sites should use =http://ultralight.caltech.edu:8080/jclarens/xmlrpc=

---++ jClarens

Any service deployed in the jClarens grid service container will automatically be published to the Discovery Service.  This includes the Discovery Service itself as well as some utility services included with jClarens.

---++ MonALISA

It is possible, though entirely not recommended, to publish directly to the Discovery Service using the ApMon client libraries provided by MonALISA.  This mechanism requires that you have detailed knowledge about how jClarens interacts with MonALISA, so it is not recommeded or even described here.
