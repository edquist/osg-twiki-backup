---++ Status of two VOs in the ITB
   * Fermilab VO: Steve Timm and Dan Yocum
     * This is Fermigrid; VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 
   * MIS VO
     * This is for the CI infrastructure - main customers are GridCat and ACDC. 
   * LIGO
     * LIGO VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS has been up for a month - we should start using it.
   * An email should be sent out describing how to to include these VOs. 
   * We need the authoritive list of VOs that are being supported.
   * Need to wait for Leigh to return.
   * Alan suggests adding a way of updating a component in the software cache in between releases.  Have a daily cron script update automatically, only for particular scripts.  Can this be handled in Pacman?  Saul thinks so.  Separate out a pacman cache that is more volatile, and updated regularly?

   * GT4 readiness
      * See the WSGramServiceReadinessPlan off the GlobusOSG page. VDT schedule?

      * Need to follow up on the short term publication proposal.

   * Addition of SRM client tools (srm-cp)
      * Neha was working with Leigh.  

   * Update to the default GIP configuration (Ransom, Shoawen)
      * There is a script now to do the configuration automatically. 
      * Will be tested by the MIS folks, also working with Alain to see if its going into VDT
      * L. Field said the publication method has changed, need to adapt.
      * Plan to put this into the next ITB release.
