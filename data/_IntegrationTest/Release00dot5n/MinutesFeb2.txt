---++ Agenda

<pre>

1) From the consortium meeting we've identifed a list of issues and 
timeframe, which we need to review and discuss:

  http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ItbRel035

2) Can we get a report from UCSD on testing and development
of the modified (fork-queue) gatekeeper intended for VDT 1.3.10

3) Can we get a report from Nebraska on WS-Gram scalability
testing

4) Resource Selection Service - Gabriele Garzoglio

5) WS-GRAM scalability enhancements for VDT - Alain

6) Strategy for dealing with integration issues relating to interop:
we need someone to track and report on these for both EGEE
and Teragrid

7) Report on GIP validation - on-going work from Iowa

8) Testing of WS-Gram PRIMA callout - report

9) Policy publication fix-ups discussed for 0.4.1: - report

10) Provisioning - issues.  We need a co-chair replacement to
train with Burt on 0.4.1


</pre>

---++ Overall Schedule

   * http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ItbRel035
 
---++ WS Gram scalability testing - Brian/Nebraska

   * Working with CMS application CRAB
   * Submits 3500 jobs via Condor-G to WS-GRAM
   * Small bugs will be fixed in VDT 1.3.10
   * A couple of medium problems - Globus bugzilla tickets sent
   * Two show-stoppers:
      * RFT SQL disconnect error
         * After 8 hours without a transfers, MYSQL server hangs up from RFT and transfers die. Gatekeeper needs to remain active.
         * Will this be fixed in VDT 1.3.10? Requires patch of Globus.  Unlikely that will have re-built and tested globus rebuilt and tested by Feb 15.  (*issue*)
      * When there are lots of failing jobs on the compute nodes, the container crashes even under moderate loads (RFT and WS-GRAM deadlocks).  Happens when jobs crash, as files are tranferred back.  
         * Stu: perhaps the ws gram container has run out of threads; thinks there are things to do to work through the issues. How long to obtain patches for VDT?  Not known yet.
   * Seems that it scales up much better than ws-gram.
   * Need wider testing from other applications.
   * pre ws-gram set a variable for a scratch directory, but ws-gram does not, causes CRAB to crash.  Minor change affected an application - need to made aware of - simple work-around.
   * Would like to work with other sites that have more experience with ws-gram.
   * Stu: have had success with Pegasus jobs (Gaurang) - need to compare notes.

---++ Can we get a report from UCSD on testing and development
of the modified (fork-queue) gatekeeper intended for VDT 1.3.10 - Terrance

   * Terrance working with Jamie/wisc on gatekeeper mods at UCSD
   * Running modified fork queue on gatekeeper (its a condor scheduler); jobs require local universe
   * Problems from quotes in globus-job-run commands
   * Aside from this, works well.  Side-affects: can see gridmonitor executing.  Slightly greater submission delay going through condor_q/schedd. No scheduling in the traditional sense.  Executes immediately.  Can throttle things - by limiting number of fork jobs. Jobs will have to wait in the queue - will lead to impacts on application side.  Other knobs can be used (eg. Condor groups to make decisions on jobs to set priorities). Don't want to limit the gridmonitor to execute, would have to recognize this. Other high priority things - such as MIS.
   * Q: could you limit the command set available to fork (eg. ping job manager). MIS does some fairly complicated commands.
   * For VDT 1.3.10 - will make it, no problem.

---++ Pre WS-GRAM scalability enhancements for VDT - Alain

   * Alain thought there would be two releases... if we had more time, would like to make this convergence with Teragrid.  Not likely for two weeks. Need to discuss priority here (*issue*).

---++ Resource Selection Service - Gabriele Garzoglio

   * Not sure he can make it by 0.4.1.
   * RSS made of two components: central service (Java plus condor matchmaking); at gateway nodes (glite CEMon, integrated with GIP). 
   * Goal: perform abstract to concrete attributes.  CEMon responsible for advertizing as a Class-Ad, for Condor matchmaking.  
   * Feb 23 looks to agressive.
   * Integrated to learn about which documents are required.
   * CEMon already included VDT - need to get the right version.  Provide scripts for OSG GIP glueing to CEMon.
   * Question is how this relates to the discovery service.
   * Expect for 0.6.0 July 15, given the schedule for 0.4.1.
   * Will look at NewOSGServices and develop readiness plan.

---++ Strategy for dealing with integration issues relating to interop: we need someone to track and report on these for both EGEE and Teragrid

   * Leigh - EGEE
      * Reports that GGUS ticket system being integrated with OSG
      * BDII infrastructure will be setup
      * Joint VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo for monitoring and information - there will be an LCG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo that we will support it. 
      * Preproduction service and integration testbed correspond to the infrastructure for interoperation
      * Working with Laurence and the GOC database to get OSG represented there
   * Stu - Teragrid
      * Still in the testing stage - OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's not yet relying on it.
      * Automation possible on the Teragrid site.
      * Alan suggests that here may be a spot where VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo related issues may be introduced here.
      * Greg has setup an OSG gatekeeper on a TG site, with ATLAS job submission.  Greg will draft a set of items.

---++ Report on GIP validation - on-going work from Iowa
   
   * Plan is to improve the current website for validating the current GIP.
   * Schema level validation (detailed attribute checking) to become part of the tool. (No one has done this yet.)
   * Hope that process doesn't affect sites or end-users.
   * Leigh - can we add a GIP validation to our =site-verify= script?  
   * *Issue:* need to prioritize the above two.

---++ Testing of WS-Gram PRIMA callout - report

   * VDT has been internally testing - works; also testing at Nebraska


---++ Policy publication fix-ups discussed for 0.4.1: - report

Report from Ruth:

   * I will start looking at the policy files and currently posted information over the next week. I will write a readiness plan for what I propose be included in 0.4.1 for discussion the week after CHEP.



---++  Provisioning - issues.  We need a co-chair replacement to train with Burt on 0.4.1

   * Call for volunteer for provisioning co-chair for 0.4.1 - need a concrete name. (*issue*)
   * OSG 0.6.0 will be a challenge unless they are involved in this release.

---++ AOB

   * None
