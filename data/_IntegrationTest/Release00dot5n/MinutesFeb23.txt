---++ Globus in VDT 1.3.10

Features of Globus in the VDT 1.3.10 release.

   * Default vs optional Globus properties
      * Disabled Streaming [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0602b&L=osg-int&T=0&P=308] Update from Feb 8th]]
      * Default installation and startup of Globus WS-GRAM services
      * Installation procedures and issue for the managed-fork job manager
      * Changing from the authenticated MDS as default -- this has been fixed, but is an option in the OSG install.


---++ GIP configuration updates

   * Steve's issues: correctly reporting accounting groups for Condor.  Anand is working on this issue providing changes to Alain.

   * GIP check in ACDC dashboard doesn't seem to work properly (Alan).  Need to follow-up with Iowa team.

   * Site name issue - script figures this out from the OSG configuration rather than the monalisa site name. (Q: should the monalisa get name from the same place. John will provide patch.) 

   * Note: order of configure scripts: OSG, ML, GIP. Combine in one script?

   * PBS queue information [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0602b&L=osg-int&T=0&P=5991]Discuss Ransoms' questions]]
      * Being addressed in VDT 1.3.10.  Fix for PBS requires Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names and multiple queue names. Which attributes to be used. Are the right attributes being used? Following LCG convention. Will be included in the configuration script.

   * Laurence's Email to Interop on Wed:

<pre>
Date: Wed, 22 Feb 2006 10:51:56 +0100
From: Laurence Field <Laurence.Field@cern.ch> 
Subject: GIP config in OSG
To: osg-interoperability@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG

Hi,

I have found a problem with the GIP configuration for OSG.

The values for the following attributes in the GlueSite entry have quotes around them. These should
+be removed.

GlueSiteName
GlueSiteLatitude
GlueSiteLongitude
      
</pre>

   * Site name quote problem will be fixed.

   * All outstanding problems seem to be identified, but some validations still need to be made.  The validation script is now part of site verify.   Alan still is having problems with the GIP validation (can't find the glue schema.)



---++ BDII version 

   * Update BDII version (3.4.2-1) to be deployed for the ITB 0.3.6 release
    
   * MDS VO = sitename fixes a current problem with the GIP (replacing local) so that its read correctly. Currently in VDT 1.3.10. 

   * Current release is 3.5.4-1, which is what Iowa and LCG uses, but minor releases don't matter much.

   * IU installs from source, UI installs as part of LCG release.


---++ Policy 

   * Ruth reports no progress on this policy template.


---++ Provisioning

   * Provisioning date will slip to April 23.
   * Rob Q will send list documents needed for provisioning - installation instructions, etc, that get ported from Trash/Integration twiki to OSG production documented.  There are about 30.  Need to make sure we get the Trash/Integration and Provisioning documentation procedures in synch.
   * Q: where is the document describing the 0.4.1? ItbRel036 points to the major changes.
 
---++ AOB

   * Steve: how to advertise separate gridftp services hosts. Steve, Mark and Anand will examine this (does it need to be captured in GIP?) and will provide a recommendation.  Can this be available in time for 1.3.10.
