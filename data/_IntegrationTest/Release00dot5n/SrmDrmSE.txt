---++Introduction - What is SRM/DRM?

The SRM/DRM (Disk Resource Manager) is a grid middleware that allows you to add an SRM interface on top of any disk-based unix file system. Version 1.2.9 of the DRM service supports SRM spec v1.1.

---++Who needs SRM/DRM?

DRM is an SRM based on disks. It manages and gives an SRM interface to the small disk based storage, local disks or SE. Users may have their own personal DRM that manages and gives an SRM interface to their local disk based storage. It requires the minimal administrative efforts on the deployment, updates, start or stop. If SE spans on multiple file systems including an access to MSS, [[Trash.Trash/Trash/IntegrationCMSSrmdCache][SRM/dCache]] should be considered.


---++SRM/DRM readiness plan 

1.   Goal : to deploy DRM, an SRM implementation onto of a disk-based unix file system, on to a standard OSG-SE/CE.

2.   Purpose: to provide managed access to tactical storage on execution sites.

3.   Method 

   * Provide access to tactical storage through the SRM interface by putting an SRM on to the $DATA space. 

   * Operate the site with the new service and establish that the operation of all other OSG services function properly and/or as expected. 

   * Create web presence for the activity through Trash/Trash/Integration.GridCat and/or Monalisa.

4.   Status: STAR analysis scenario works; an app runs jobs that creates result files and moves the files of the remote archival site. 

5.   Test and verify the DRM service: srm-tester is available through VDT as a separate package or through the same DRM package to test its SRM compatibility and interoperability.

6.   Plans:
   * Schedule an CMS application test and determine what changes need to be made to the site configuration and OSG services 
   * Another application such as ATLAS or SDSS to repeat the test
   * Determine and document performance and scalability of the site with the added DRM services

---++ Documentation and Support

Documentation and manual for SRM/DRM v1.2.9 is available on http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist.
Support available through srm@lbl.gov.
