---++Message from Deployment

<verbatim>
Dear Rob and Leigh,

 From todays Deployment Meeting we have the following feedback to the 
Integration Activity:

We recommend that the first OSG Release Candidate be readied for 
validation the 5th April, with a goal for OSG Deployment the first week 
in May. This schedule was acceptable to the following VO Liaisons - 
LIGO (Kent), D0 (Joel), CDF (Alan), Grase (Mark), FMRI (Jed), STAR 
(Doug), ATLAS (Razvan), CMS (Ruth), iVDGL (Jorge). Dane was not able to 
be at the meeting. We propose that the Co-chairs of the Integration, 
Deployment and Operations Activities would  bring this recommendation 
to the Governance meeting on April 5th.

To enable readiness of  this release candidate we propose

a) It be based on VDT 1.3.4 if this is released by April 1st. Otherwise 
be based on VDT 1.3.3 with any necessary patches, and with GUMS 
distributed directly from the GUMS web site.

b)  SRM/DRM will not be part of the first deployment. We should plan to 
enable an incremental upgrade of the infrastructure when DRM is ready 
for deployment. This will mean sustaining the Integration and 
Provisioning Activities after OSG deployment.

c) We have some questions with regard to the GUMS and privilege 
readiness plans. We will send these questions to the developers and 
copy you.
We need  more ITB sites to test GUMS and Prima prior to the release 
candidate being readied. We will work with you to identify these sites. 
There is a potential showstopper in the incompatability of 
voms-proxy-init across the EU and VDT V1.3.3 deployment of VOMS for 
ATLAS and CDF. We recommend the OSG release be delayed if this is not 
solved.

d) We understand Pacman 3 is not part of the Release.

e) We expect a readiness plan for ACDC which may result in a new 
version of ACDC for Deployment.

f) Core-MIS - we will rereview the readiness plan in 2 weeks and 
discuss  whether to recommend this service be started by default after 
the OSG Release is installed . Mark will do some performance tests.

g) The discovery service can be included as an optional component of 
the release.

g) We need to document the use of Service Certificates by the services 
in the OSG Release.

h) We will review the Operations Plan at the Deployment meeting next 
week.

The following people were present at the Deployment Meeting:
  Doug, Alan, Ruth, Booker, Kent, AdamW, MarkG, Razvan, RobK, Jorge, 
Joel, Jed, Neha, RobG,

Ruth
