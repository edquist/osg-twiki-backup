---+!!<nop>Discovery Service Installation
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction

JClarens is a grid service framework for hosting and developing new grid services. The Discovery Service is one such grid service. In order to run the Discovery Service, both JClarens and the Discovery Service packages must be installed. Fortunately, the VDT installer makes this easy.

---++Basic Installation

	1. Install a service certificate and key into =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=. This should be done before installing the VDT.  The Common Name (CN) of the certificate subject should match the name of the machine.
	1. If you haven't done so already, [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.3/installation_pacman.html][install pacman]].
	1. Install the JClarens and Discovery Service packages from the VDT cache<br/>
		=pacman -get !http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_133_cache:jClarens-Discovery=
	1. During the installation, pacman will ask if you want to enable the JClarens web services framework.  Answer =y=.
<verbatim>
		Would you like to enable the jClarens web services framework?
		Choices: y (yes), n(no), s (skip this question) y
</verbatim>
	5. If you ignored step 1, then you have a second chance to install your service certificate and key into =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=.
	5. Restart apache and tomcat with
		* service apache stop
		* service tomcat-4 stop
		* service apache start
		* service tomcat-4 start
 
---++Site Configuration

The Discovery Service requires access to a [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu][MonALISA]] server that has been configured to receive [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu/dev_ap_mon.html][ApMon publications]].  This MonALISA server does not need to reside on the same host, or even at the same site as the Discovery Service.
There are three files that must be updated for the local site installation:  

---+++$VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v4/webapps/jclarens/xmlrpc_handlers.properties
	1. Change the value of =monitor.dest= to point to the [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu][MonALISA]] server that was configured to receive [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu/dev_ap_mon.html][ApMon publications]].<br/>
		=monitor.dest=my.monalisa.host:8884=
	1. The =clarens.admin= property contains a certificate DN fragment for the user who is given full access to all services on the server.  Any user who logs in with a certificate containing this substring will bypass all access control checks.  Comment out this property to remove all adminstrator access.<br/>
		=#clarens.admin=OU=GAE=
	1. Set the =vo.name= property to the name of the virtual organization to which this server belongs.<br/>
		=vo.name=uscms=

---+++$VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v4/webapps/jclarens/mlstore.properties
	1. Change the name of the MonALISA group to OSG-ITB<br/>
		=lia.Monitor.group = OSG-ITB=

---+++$MONALISA_HOME/Service/myFarm/myFarm.conf
	1. Set up the [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu][MonALISA]] server to accept [[http://monalisa.caltech.edu/dev_ap_mon.html][ApMon publications]] by adding the following line:<br/>
		=^monXDRUDP{ListenPort=8884,ParamTimeout=3600,NodeTimeout=10800,ClusterTimeout=86400}%5=

---++Verification
There are two ways to verify that the Discovery Service is running.  The first is to use the browser interface on the local Discovery Service instance:  http://localhost:8080/jclarens/web/rendezvous/rendezvous_interface.html.  Press the 'Submit' button to see a list of services (both local and remote) that have been discovered by the registry.  At a minimum you should see an entry for the local host.  If you wait long enough (~5 minutes or less), you should start to see entries for other OSG-ITB sites as well.

The second verification test is to check the registry at [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu:8080/jclarens/web/rendezvous/rendezvous_interface.html][Caltech]].  If your local Discovery Service has been configured correctly then you should see your site listed in this registry.
