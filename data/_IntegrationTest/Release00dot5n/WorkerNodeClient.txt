---++ Introduction

This is a minimal set of executables that need to be made available to the worker nodes in a Compute Element.

It may be installed on a shared filesystem, or locally on each worker node (as long as the path on each worker node is the same).

You will be prompted for this path when running the =configure-osg.sh= script on the gatekeeper in order to set
the =$OSG_GRID= variable.

You need these client programs available from the worker node 
so that jobs which need to access grid-enabled mass storage during
the job (e.g. via globus-url-copy, VDS, or srmcp) can do so.  The worker
node also has to have either via NFS or locally a good set of 
certificate authority files with up to date certificate revocation 
lists (CRL's) for those clients to work properly.


---++ Known problems
%RED% The instructions as followed below may leave you with 
a $GLOBUS_LOCATION/TRUSTED_CA that doesn't point to anywhere
and you have to fix it manually. S. Timm 3/16/06%ENDCOLOR%
---++ Installation
Install with <Br>
=pacman -get OSG:osg-wn-client-0.4.1=

For purposes of OSG-ITB 0.3.6, do 
=pacman -get iVDGL:wn-client-0.3.6=

The installation will first ask if you trust the pacman caches,
and then if you agree to the VDT licenses.  Then there is a question
about the edg-crl-upgraded daemon.

The question looks like this:
<pre>
Do you want the EDG CRL update daemon to be run automatically when
your computer starts up? If so, we will install one file,
edg-crl-updated, into etc/rc.d/init.d/.

It will periodically update the Europen DataGrid (EDG) certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) It is essential if you are collaborating with
people from the EDG, and not important if you are not.

Do you want the EDG CRL update daemon to be installed? [y/n]  
</pre>
If you are installing this worker node client on a head node
where the OSG CE will also be installed, answer "n".  
(Otherwise you will end up with two different sets of 
certificate authority files and one or the other will get out of date).
On a worker node you should answer "y".  The CA cert files 
are needed if the job is going to do any gridftp, srmcp, or 
dcap access to external sites from or to the worker nodes.


It then asks for where you would like to install the CA Files.  Question looks 
like this:
<pre>
The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
		  r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
				(existing CA files will be preserved)
		  l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
		  n (no)	 - do not install
</pre>

On the head node answer "n", on worker nodes answer "l" for local.

This process on many worker nodes can be automated with 
the following script so you don't have to type in the letters.


<pre>
VDTSETUP_AGREE_TO_LICENSES=y
export VDTSETUP_AGREE_TO_LICENSES
VDTSETUP_INSTALL_CERTS=l
export VDTSETUP_INSTALL_CERTS
VDTSETUP_EDG_CRL_UPDATE=y
export VDTSETUP_EDG_CRL_UPDATE
pacman -trust-all-caches -get iVDGL:wn-client-0.3.6
</pre> 



Note--If you are installing this package on a head node / compute 
element where an OSG CE install will also be done afterwards,
it is recommended that you log out and log back in before continuing
with the main OSG CE Install, otherwise all the wn-client
stuff will be in your path and confuse everything.

Note--A side effect of the worker node client as currently configured,
is that $GLOBUS_LOCATION can and does wind up in a different location 
on the head node than it does on the worker node.  The environment
at the beginning of the job will give you $GLOBUS_LOCATION on 
the head node.  You have to source $OSG_GRID/setup.sh to get 
where $GLOBUS_LOCATION is available to you on the worker node.

---++References

	* For reference, the OSG cache directory: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/.

---++Alternative Viewpoint and Approach

	* Installation of the worker node client package does imply maintenance of the certificates that it installs.  As an alternative, it is possible to simply rsync the installed full osg installation to the worker nodes, and independently of whether this option is chosen, use rsync to keep the certificates up to date.  
	* Doing anything automatically on the worker nodes requires care.  An example script that looks to see what worker nodes on a cluster using pbsnodes is attached to this page.  It can be edited or replaced with a more general version to match your specific cluster conditions.  Note that the example script does not use the batch system itself, but uses a feature of the local batch scheduler to avoid trying to push certificates to worker nodes that are down and to build a list of operating nodes to receive the update.
	* This issue deserves further discussion.
