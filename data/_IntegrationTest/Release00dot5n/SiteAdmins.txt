---++ITB Participation
Here we write down some notes regarding how site administrators participate in the OSG ITB activity. It is expected that the level of effort will vary over the course of the activity with intense installation sessions followed by periods of relative calm.  This timing is driven by the availability and schedules of new services making their way into the OSG.  On average, 1/4 FTE is usually required for participation.

---++Site Registration
Note from Ruth (5/24/05) which is a lightweight proposal for a testbed site registration procedure for ITB participants.  This serves two purposes – to let the operations team know some basic contact information, and to transmit certain information to GridCat informing the developer (Bockjoo) that a new site is to be added.

To register, please email the following  to igoc at ivdgl.org - copy/paste the text 
below in the body:

<verbatim>
Short_Site_Name
Host_Name
SystemAdmin email
System Admin phone
$app path name
$data path name
$tmp path name
$wntmp path name
</verbatim>

---++VO Level VO Management
PrivilegeVOWhatToDo describes the setup needed for a VO configuration. This infrastructure needs to be setup before services are configured to provide services to that VO.  **What do site admins need to do to verify what they need is there ? Doe they tie to OSG Operations or something from VDT ... ?**


---++Installation Guide for Core Services

We are currently Twiki-wording the installation procedures for OSG site adminstrators. Here is where we hope all site admins will jump in and edit, provide comments, etc, based on their experiences.

	* PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo has a flowchart guide to determine prerequisites for various Authorization configurations.
	* [[PrivilegeVOWhatToDo][OSGVomsInstallGuide]] gives the installation instructions for VO administrators to install a VOMS.
	* [[PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo][GumsInstallGuide]] gives the installation instructions for facility account managers to install a GUMS. **This should have instructions for how to install GUMS without assuming the OSGCore has already been installed. This to break circular references since GUMS is required infrastructure for a full privilege CE install.**
	* OSGCoreInstallGuide gives the common, essential installation instructions to install a basic OSG Compute Element.  To shut down OSG services prior to doing an upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
	* GoldenChainDebugging documents various tests to determine what might be wrong if a site_verify fails on Authentication.
	* OSGDiscoveryInstallGuide (Need to tie to Michael's info) gives the installation instructions for Discovery service providers (a few per site).
	* The legacy, html-based [[OsgItbInstallation][quick installation]] instruction guide

---++Site Level VO Management

Recommendations for site-level VO management are found on the PrivilegeOSG web.
