---++ Introduction

This document is intended for administrators responsible for installing and configuring an OSG Compute Element (CE). 
It is not meant as an all-inclusive guide to Grid computing or even all the options for configuring a CE. It provides a recipe for a default configuration of the OSG provided reference implementation. It makes recommendations that have been found to be sensible starting points by OSG participants and may exceed the minimum requirements. Parties who wish to adapt to some local requirements/configuration should expect to have to adapt these instructions to their use.
Those interested in the formal requirements of a Compute Element are referred to the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=28OSG Deployment Document]].

---+++ Operating Systems

The instructions assume you're using one of the following Linux distributions:

	* Red Hat 7.x
	* Red Hat 9.0
	* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
	* Fedora Core 3 
	* Debian Linux 3.1 (Sarge)

Installation may be successful with other Linux distributions, but they have not been tested by the maintainers of Pacman and the VDT.  Several "binary-compatible"
distributions such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.x (x=3,4) and Rocks 3.x (x>=1)
have been successfully installed by members of the OSG-ITB treating them 
as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 but no support is implied.
%RED% Can we add the right comment for Rocks? %ENDCOLOR%

---+++Installation Method
The installation and configuration method is based on <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/">Pacman</a>.  Pacman is a package manager like RPM or dpkg, but is able to work on and support multiple platforms.  Specific Pacman directions are given below, and in the pre-installation procedures.

---+++ Conventions used
The following conventions are used in these pages:
	* =monospaced text= indicates terminal output 
	* ==bold monospaced text== indicates terminal input (by the user)
	* =<i>monospaced text in italics</i>= indicates variable data that may differ on your installation
	* the =&gt;= prompt indicates commands that do not require a specific shell or root access
	* the =#= prompt indicates commands that require root access
	* the =$= prompt indicates sh- or bash-specific commands
	* the =%= prompt indicates csh- or tcsh-specific commands

---++ Pre-installation Checklist
---+++ System or Cluster Already Setup (including batch system)?
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should be likewise previously installed and configured, unless you intend to use the Condor system that can optionally be installed with VDT.	

---+++ Preserving a pre-existing Condor installation?
(Does this pertain to an external-to-VDT Condor installation?) If you would like to preserve your existing Condor configuration, you can set two environment variables so Pacman will recognize this. 

	* *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION* - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. _/opt/condor_). The Condor _bin/_, _bin_, _etc/_, _lib/_... directories should be directly under this location.
	* *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG* (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is _$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config_.

This will result in:
	* Condor being installed but not configured. 
	* VDT middleware services pointing to appropriate locations in your external Condor installation.

For example, if you wish to preserve a Condor installed in the standard location,

<pre>
# export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT
</pre>
will suffice (provided $CONDOR_ROOT is set, per the usual Condor config)

It is NOT necessary to execute the setup.sh from any previously existing VDT installation in order to do an upgrade.  
(DDS What does that mean ? Upgrade of what ? I thought VDT didn't do upgrades ?)
It is possible, though certainly not recommended, to ManuallyChangeCondorPath after the OSG installation is finished.  This might be necessary if you have to reinstall your batch scheduler into a different location.

---+++ Network setup ?
It is assumed that your hardware has a working network connection through which packages may be retrieved and from which services may contact your system. The full OSG CE packages is ~700MB so you don't want to be a the far end of a modem !

---++++ Firewall?
If your installation is inside a site firewall or has a host firewall setup (look at host.allow/deny), you'll need to review the [[OSGCEInstallGuide#Firewalls][Firewall section]] of this guide and arrange for appropriate Internet access.

---++++ Time synchronization (NTP) 
Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of eg. proxy lifetimes. 

---++++ Reverse name lookups (DNS)
For the middleware to correctly function both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system.

#UniqueName 
---+++ You'll need a unique OSG site name
Each OSG site will need to designate a *unique name* by which services and resources may refer to the site. This name will be displayed on the Site Catalog and used in tables for other monitoring and accounting.  For example, the University of New Mexico has a unique name of UNM_HPC; the University of Buffalo is Buffalo_CCR.

---+++ Previous OSG or Grid3 Installations?
If there is a _previous installation_ of the OSG or Grid3 environment or other Globus middleware, please _stop the processes_ which are currently running. This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), MonALISA and other services configured to start upon initialization on your system. More information is provided in [[OSG Shutdown Guide]].

---+++ Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs
UNIX user accounts need to be created by the system administrator for the VOs.  
You will need to create at least one local user account (with the appropriate configuration) for each VO to which you wish to provide resources.  The uid and name of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later in the installation, but there are assumed defaults detailed in OsgVoAccounts. Those defaults are assumed for examples used in this installation guide.

The accounts are: 
	* cdf
	* grase
	* fmri
	* gadu
	* btev
	* uscms01
	* uscms02
	* usatlas1
	* usatlas2
	* usatlas3
	* sdss
	* lsc01
	* ivdgl
	* star
	* osg

---+++ Do you have a user certificate?
You will need to have the ability to get your personal grid proxy on the machine to run the validation tests and for debugging purposes. If you don't have a user certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy, see your VO support center (%RED% or do what if this IS the VO expert %ENDCOLOR% ?).

---++ Installing and Setting up Pacman
Instructions for installing and setting up Pacman for your specific platform can be found at [[https://uimon.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/GetPacman][Pacman Notes]]. (%RED% Need to move this to OSG twiki %ENDCOLOR%.)

<hr>

---++ Installing OSG CE Services

Now you're ready to start installing the Compute Element services.

---+++ Choose an Installation Directory 
This is typically something like <b>/usr/local/grid</b>, but whatever suits the local resource structure is fine. If you are installing on a
cluster, this directory must be available on all the nodes. If this directory is not shared additional installation of
software will be required on each of the worker nodes. Nearly all of the software to be installed is from the VDT.

For example,
<pre>
	export VDT_LOCATION=/usr/local/grid
	cd $VDT_LOCATION
</pre>

(%RED% Should we add a warning about installing two pacman caches into the same directory ? %ENDCOLOR%)

---+++Installing the OSG CE software package

The installation described here is done as root.  However, non-root installs are supported. (%RED% There should probably be some caveat or supplemental reference here otherwise why have the "as root" default ? It IS dangerous if unnecessary. %ENDCOLOR%) Not all services will run as root; Condor, 
MonALISA and the GRIS will run as the user "daemon". If you prefer to run MonALISA and/or Condor with its own UID, you need only to create a 
<b>monalisa</b> and/or <b>condor</b> user before proceeding with the installation. The VDT will configure the daemons appropriately.  _Verify that the umask is set to "0022" prior to installation.  Failure to do so may render the installation unusable._

A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed. Please answer *y* (yes) so that the
software can be retrieved. (Note that it may be necessary to set your platform if you are installing a Linux version based upon Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3. See further [[https://uimon.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/GetPacman][Pacman Notes]]).  Finally, make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH.

<pre>
&gt; <b>pacman -get iVDGL:osg-0.1.6</B> 
Do you want to add [iVDGL] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>
Package [osg-0.1.6] found in [iVDGL]...
Package [osg-auto-0.1.6] found in [iVDGL]...
Package [VDT_136] found in [iVDGL]...
Do you want to add [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_136_cache] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>
...
...
...
</pre>
In the case of platforms such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.4 you may get
the following question:
<pre>
The VDT is unable to recognize your platform.  This version of the VDT is
supported on several Linux releases:

	 RedHat 7
	 RedHat 9
	 RedHat Enterprise Linux 3
	 Fedora Core 3
	 Debian 3.1

The VDT may work on other platforms, but it's not guaranteed.  If you
encounter problems and send mail to the VDT team for support please mention
that you are installing the VDT on an unsupported platform.

Do you wish to continue? [y/n]
</pre>
(Answer yes).

If you plan to use Condor, answer <b>y</b> (yes) to the question posed regarding setting up the Condor job manager.  
By default, a personal-condor instance is installed to facilitate testing.<br>

<pre>If you would like, we can set up a Globus jobmanager interface
to Condor.

This will allow Globus Gatekeeper to run jobs on Condor.

Would you like to enable Globus jobmanager for Condor?
Choices: y (yes), n(no), s (skip this question) <b>y</b>
</pre>

 Other questions may be asked. It is safe to answer <b>n</b> (no).


<b>This will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending
upon the system and network connection.</b> During this time you may open a second 
terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the <b>vdt-install.log</b> file.
The installation should complete
with the following message. (%RED% What message is that ?%ENDCOLOR%)

---+++Setup OSG Install Environment
 Assuming the Pacman install completed without fatal errors, you should now be able to source the OSG setup environment.
<pre>  $ <b>source setup.sh</b>
</pre> 
or
<pre>  % <b>source setup.csh</b>
</pre> 

---+++Path Modification for Kerberos 
If you are using Kerberos locally, note that $VDT_LOCATION/jdk1.4/bin has been prefixed to your $PATH, which contains (among other things) kinit, klist, and ktab.  This is almost certainly not what you want, and will be corrected in VDT 1.3.6.

---+++Post Install README
*Read the $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README file*.  Make changes as needed. (Ignore instruction to put users that need access to MDS into the gridmap file if you will be implementing GUMS. )

---+++Optional packages for PBS, LSF, or FBSNG
An extra package may be required to setup access to an existing PBS, LSF, or FBSNG installation. If you plan on using condor no action is necessary.  *Ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path*, then install the appropriate package (for PBS, LSF, or FBSNG, respectively): 
<pre>
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache:Globus-PBS-Setup
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache:Globus-LSF-Setup
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache:Globus-FBSNG-Setup
</pre>

---++Configure the Public Key Infrastructure
Minimally, you will need a host certificate and private key to identify of your CE.

---+++ Setup and maintenance of Certificate Authority connection

Configure the DOEGrids CA to be used by default by running the utility below. 
<I>If there is an option "<b>choose the option 
 which matches "1c3f2ca8 : ...</b>", then enter "<b>q</b>" at the prompts.</I>
		  <pre>&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/setup-cert-request</b>
Reading from /g3dev/globus/TRUSTED_CA
Using hash: 1c3f2ca8
Setting up grid-cert-request
Running grid-security-config...
<br>...<br></pre>

A <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.5/certificate_authorities.html">list of CAs</a> were added as authorized CAs on your system. Please review the list of authorized CAs and modify the set in /etc/grid-security/certificates as needed to match your local policy.  

The daemon <b>edg-crl-upgrade</b> should be running at all times in the background to refresh the CRLs from these CAs.  If CRLs are not kept current, incoming connections will fail. 
To check that it's running:

<verbatim>
 ps axwww | grep edg-crl-upgrade
</verbatim>
If not running, do
<verbatim>
 /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded start
</verbatim>

The CertScripts package can assist you with choosing CA's to trust and and periodically checking that the CRLs have not expired.

---+++ Request and Install Host Certificate
To authorize this resource for use, a host certificate needs to be obtained from an appropriate Certificate Authority. Currently the 
<a href="http://igoc.ivdgl.indiana.edu/grid-install/documentation/www.doegrids.org"> DOEGrids CA </a>is the most common CA in use for OSG participants.
iVDGL and PPDG project instructions for getting a certificate are available on the <a href="http://igoc.ivdgl.indiana.edu/RAinfo/newra/">iVDGL RA</a> and <a href="http://www.ppdg.net/RA">PPDG RA</a> sites. 
	 
Here is a brief guide to the process assuming you have a valid User Certificate. 
 
	* Run grid-cert-request to generate your host's private key 
(<b>hostkey.pem</b>) and the certificate request.
		  <pre>&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>. ./setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>./globus/bin/grid-cert-request -host <i>hostname.domain.tld</i></b>
Using configuration from <I>/usr/local/grid</I>/globus/etc/globus-host-ssl.conf

.++++++
.........................................................++++++
writing new private key to '<I>/usr/local/grid</I>/globus/etc/hostkey.pem'<br>-----<br>...<br></pre> 

	* Copy the <b>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/hostkey.pem</b> to the
<b>/etc/grid-security</b> directory <i>preserving
the read only for root permissions.</i>


	* The certificate request is stored as the file
<B>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/hostcert_request.pem</b> .
The important part (referred to as the PKCS#10 request) will look similar to the following:
<pre>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----
MIIBmzCCAQQCAQAwWzETMBEGCgmSJomT8ixkARkTA29yZzEYMBYGCgmSJomT8ixk

Connect to the DOEGrids CA server and paste this into the
area provided in the form at the URL &lt;<a href="https://pki1.doegrids.org/ManServerEnroll.html">https://pki1.doegrids.org/ManServerEnroll.html</a>&gt;.
		  <i> All of the information must be filled out and in the
additional comments

	* Email will arrive indicating a link to retrieve the host
certificate <b>hostcert.pem</b> .  Goto the link and download the certificate to
<b>/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b> on the host.

	* The following command will verify the certificate is readable.
<pre>&gt; <b>openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
</pre>
Outputs something like:
<pre>
Certificate:<br>	 Data:<br>		  Version: 3 (0x2)<br>		  Serial Number: 1578 (0x62a)<br>		  Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption<br>		  Issuer: DC=org, DC=DOEGrids, OU=Certificate Authorities, CN=DOEGrids CA 1<br>		  Validity<br>				Not Before: Mar 19 14:48:32 2004 GMT<br>				Not After : Mar 19 14:48:32 2005 GMT<br>		  Subject: DC=org, DC=doegrids, OU=Services, CN=worldgrid.iu.edu<br>.....<br></pre>
	 
---+++ Get an LDAP service certificate to run authenticated MDS (optional)
		  <pre>&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>. ./setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>./globus/bin/grid-cert-request -host <i>hostname.domain.tld</i> -service ldap</b></pre>
And follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating <b>ldapkey.pem</b> and <b>ldapcert.pem</b>. More info on service certificates can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.5/installation_post.html#servicecert">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.5/installation_post.html#servicecert</a>

---++ Configuration and Setup of OSG CE Services

---+++Globus Configuration
Globus has been pre-configured for this installation. If you wish
reconfigure it, please review the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/globus_config.html">
Globus Configuration Script</a> document on using
the <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus.sh</b> script. 

Review the configuration files <b>/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper</b> and
<b>/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp</b> (or in <b>/etc/inetd.conf</b>). Additionally 
these services must be listed in the <b>/etc/services</b> file.  When you are happy,
restart the xinetd (or inetd) daemon to pick up the configuration changes:
<pre>
[root@mysite grid]# /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart
Stopping xinetd:														 [  OK  ]
Starting xinetd:														 [  OK  ]
</pre>

To verify that the gatekeeper is running at this point, you should be able to telnet to the public IP address of your site on port 2119 and get a response. Run "telnet <i>hostname port</i>".  It should return "Connected to...". The same should be true of the gsiftp port(s) (2811 by default, or 2812 for the new server, gsiftp2).


---+++Configuring the Grid3 Information Provider

Grid3 developed a set of conventions about information to provide for a Computing Element. OSG is continuing to use those conventions to provide backward compatibility and as an interrim solution until consensus on a more dynamic information system is achieved. The Grid3 Information Provider collects that information and makes it available, via a standard config file ($VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-info.conf), to other applications/services.
There is a configuration script (<b>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-grid3.sh</b>) which automates much of the configuration.

The meaning and purpose of the various elements of the Grid3 schema are documented further in the GridThreeSchema
pages. New resource admins may want read that information carefully and determine how to map those elements onto their Resource before proceeding. Guidance on the basic elements and common defaults is provided below.

---++++ Gather configuration information

OSG strives to make the minimum requirements on a resource, however, to provide a basic execution environment that applications can build upon, certain information about file/filesystem locations is needed. Filesystem sharing and filesystem mount points available for a cluster requires specific coordination for applications to be installed and to be executed correctly. To this purpose, four special directory hierarchies (mount points) will be required to be defined and allocated in the OSG environment. These directories may be required to be available on the head node or gatekeeper node and also available, using the exact path, on each of the worker nodes or simply shared filespace.

* %RED%Grid Directory%ENDCOLOR%

	 This directory is where the Grid environment will be installed. This directory will contain the Globus middleware and other middleware applications. It should be writable for the user root. This directory contains both server and client utilities for the middleware and therefore should be shared between gatekeeper and worker nodes.

* %RED%Temporary Directories%ENDCOLOR%

	 There will be two temporary directories one will be local to the worker node and the other shared. The shared temporary directory will be the current working directory of a running application and persist only as long as the job is executing. The files in this directory should be managed by the running application Automated clean up may be required to be handled by the site administrator. All users should 
be able to use this directory for writing and reading files. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per worker node. The local temporary directory may be used by applications to reduce latency to data. At least 10G should be available in this directory. 

* %RED%Data Directory%ENDCOLOR%

	 The data directory will be required to be shared from the head node (gatekeeper node) to each of the worker nodes. This will be the directory to which applications will write input and output data files for running jobs. This directory should be writable by all users. Users will be able to create sub-directories which are private, as provided by the filesystem. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per worker node. One VO would like 100G+ per worker node. 

* %RED%Application Directory%ENDCOLOR%

	 If required or desired this will be the location of Grid3 the application software. Only users in the application VO will have write privileges to these directories. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per application. 


One of the questions enquires about the <b>VO sponsor</b> of this site.
This attempts to determine the longterm average allocation between VOs of the current cluster. The notation
incorperates a VOname followed by a percentage so that clusters are able to note multiple VO partners. 

---++++ Execute the configuration script

Run the following script as root to execute the configurations script.

<pre>
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring</b>
# <b>./configure-grid3.sh</b>
</pre>

For a typical installation, the script will look something like this:

<pre>

Please specify your GRID3 SITE NAME [_hostname.domain.tld_]: <b><i><a href="#UniqueName">UNIQUE_NAME</a></i></b>

Please specify your GRID3 BASE_DIR [/usr/local/grid]:

Please specify your GRID3 APP_DIR [/app]:

Please specify your GRID3 DATA_DIR [/data]:

Please specify your GRID3 TMP_DIR [/scratch]:

Please specify your GRID3 TMP_WN_DIR [/tmp]:

Possible Sponsors are usatlas, ivdgl ligo uscms sdss.
You can express the percentage of sponsorship using
the following notation. 'usatlas:50 ivdgl:10 uscms:20 local:20'
Please specify the VO sponsor of this site [iVDGL]:

Please specify the Batch Queuing to be used [condor]:


Please review the information:
Grid Site Name:  <i><a href="#UniqueName">UNIQUE_NAME</a></i>
Grid3 Location:  <i>/usr/local/grid</i>
Application:	  <i>/app</i>
Data:				<i>/data</i>
Shared Temp:	  <i>/scratch</i>
WorkerNode Temp: <i>/tmp</i>
JOB Manager:	  <i>condor</i>

Is this information correct (y/n)? [n]: <b>y</b>
#</pre>

This configure script creates the $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-info.conf file. 
This file is the standard resource information file used by several monitoring services and applications to obtain basic resource configuration information. This file is *required* to be readable from that location for OSG CE's.
The resource owner may choose which information services to run to advertise this information. Configuration of several of the more popular ones is described below in the Monitoring section.

---+++Job Policy and the Batch Queuing System 
The configuration of a production queue manager is beyond the scope of this document. Since there will be periodic validation submitted by DNs in the (which ? Has this been rationalized ?) VO, sites are strongly encouraged to provide at least two levels of priority and assign the lowest priority to the "osg" grid user.

The commands
<pre># <b>CONDOR_CONFIG="$VDT_LOCATION/condor/etc/condor_config"</b>
# <b>export CONDOR_CONFIG</b>
# <b>$VDT_LOCATION/condor/sbin/condor_master</b></pre>
will start the default personal-condor batch installation with 
default queuing, if you chose the default condor installation earlier.

---+++ Authorizing Users: Test Configuration

The first step is to configure the CE to allow access using your own Grid credentials. Once that's done you'll be able to run local tests and verify operation of your CE locally.

Make sure you have a Grid proxy for yourself. 
(Run grid-proxy-init or voms-proxy-init are the usual methods)  

<pre>
$ grid-proxy-info
</pre>
should return something like 
<pre>
subject  : /DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Dane Skow/UID=dane
issuer	: /DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=Certificate Authorities/CN=Kerberized CA
identity : /DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Dane Skow/UID=dane
...
</pre>

Take the subject string and prepend it to the file /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile and assign it to a local user account (you can use any of the VO accounts you've created at the beginning to test). So the grid-mapfile should have at least one entry like:
<pre>
 $ cat /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Dane Skow/UID=dane" usatlas1
</pre>

This is enough to enable the rest of the installation testing.
OsgCEAuthorization contains further instructions on how to configure the CE to allow others to access it. You can come back to that step after verifying basic operations of your CE. 

---++Monitoring Setup

---+++ Configure MIS-CI (CoreMIS)
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (MIS-CI) provides 
information on the site environment and computing resources. The OSG-CE package includes MIS-CI. 
This section describes how to configure MIS-CI if you wish to enable it.

The $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/configure-misci.sh performs the configuration. It
creates or adds a crontab for the MIS-CI information collectors:
<pre>
<b>#cd $VDT_LOCATION</b> 
<b>#. $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b> 

(If a GUMS maps the GridCat DN to a different account, not ivdgl, 
will this be a problem for MIS-CI? If yes, how to fix it?)

<b>#$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/configure-misci.sh</b> 
			Editing site configuration...
			...
			...
			...
			Would you like to set up MIS-CI cron now? (y/n) <b>y</b>
			At what frequency (in minutes) would you like to run MIS-CI ? [10]
			...
			...
			...
			Would you like to add MIS-CI crontab to this ? (y/n) <b>y</b>
			...
			...
			...
			configure--misci Done
			Please read $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/README 
</pre>

After finishing configuring the MIS-CI, a few checks might be necessary:

1. Check if crontab is created as root or as ivdgl user.
<pre>
<b>#crontab -u ivdgl -l</b>

2. As a non-root user, check if at least one table is filled
	(Depending on how the MIS-CI is configured, it might take 10 minutes or so before any table is filled.)
<pre>
<b>$ grid-proxy-init</b>
<b>$ globus-job-run &lt;hostname&gt;/jobmanager-mis /bin/sh "siteinfo"</b>
		(Here &lt;hostname&gt; is the CE hostname.)
</pre>

---+++Configure MonALISA

<!-- TWIKI BUG: For some reason, this section blocks the remaining sections at this level from appearing !-->
<!-- in the index. Needs to be last of the monitors here until fixed. !-->

The setup of MonALISA is done with the assistance of the
configuration script. However there are two files which need to be edited.
The <b>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/site_env</b> script must be modified 
manually to set the location of the batch queue.  In addition, the 
<b>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/VDTFarm/vdtFarm.conf</b> file must be updated
for the new <b>TracePath</b> module.  Instructions on how to edit these two 
files are below, following the configuration script.
  
	* Run the configuration script <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.5/configure_monalisa.html">$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_monalisa.sh</a> to set up MonALISA.
<i>The name <b>OSG-ITB</b> group should be used when queried for the "monitor group name."</i>
<br>
<pre>&gt; <b>./configure_monalisa.sh</b>


Please specify user account to run MonaLisa daemons as: [daemon]: 

This is the name you will be seen by the world, so please choose
a name that represents you. Make sure this name is unique in the 
MonaLisa environment.

Please specify the farm name [<i>hostname.domain.tld</i>]: <b><i><a href="#UniqueName">UNIQUE_NAME</a></i></b>

Your Monitor Group name is important to group your site correctly
in the global site list. OSG users should enter "OSG".

Please enter your monitor group name [<i>hostname.domain.tld</i>]: <b>OSG-ITB</b>
...
...
...</pre>

Fill in your site specific information. *NOTE: Check your latitude and longitude entries!  
If you are in the Americas, for example, your longitude will be a negative number.	
Typical continental U.S. latitudes range from 25 to 55 degrees and longitudes range from 
-60 to -120 degrees.  If you get it wrong, your site will not show up properly in MonALISA.*

<pre>
Please review the information:

MonaLisa user: daemon 
Farm name: <i><a href="#UniqueName">UNIQUE_NAME</a></i>
Monitor group: OSG-ITB
...
...
...

Is this information correct (y/n)? [n]: <b>y</b></pre>
	 
	* Edit the *site_env* file
			To have MonALISA interact with the local batch queuing system, 
			the file <b>site_env</b> will need to specify the location of the local 
			installation directories. 
<pre>&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD</b>
&gt; <b>vi site_env</b></pre>

	  Make sure the location variable for your batch system is setup and 
	  exported (*PBS_LOCATION*, *LSF_LOCATION*, or *FBSNG_LOCATION*,
	  as appropriate.)  E.g.:
 <pre><b>PBS_LOCATION="/usr/local/pbs";
export PBS_LOCATION;</b></pre>

	* Edit the vdtFarm.conf file 
 <pre>&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/VDTFarm</b>
&gt; <b>vi vdtFarm.conf</b></pre>

	  To have MonALISA use the *Tracepath* module the vdtFarm.conf
	  will need to be edited with the following line added:

 ==*Tracepath{monTracepath, localhost, " "}==

	* What's the Tracepath module, why do we need it, and why isn't it automatically installed?

	* Start Monalisa

	  <tt># <b>/etc/init.d/MLD start</b></tt> 

---++++ Testing MonALISA and its Information Providers

From a web browser, launch the MonALISA client tool (available at <a href="http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html">http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html</a>).
The client is launched from the "Start MonALISA Client" button on the
top of the left hand menu.  If it does not start automatically, you can save <b>MonaLisa_grid3.jnlp</b> to disk and execute
<pre>
<b>&gt; $JAVA_HOME/jre/javaws/javaws <nop>MonaLisa_grid3.jnlp</b>
</pre>
On the running MonALISA (ML) client, check
that your site is reporting to ML and that it has the correct geographical
location. Mouse over the dot and it will display the site name. Make
sure it is the name you picked out and that it conforms to the naming
convention (%RED% Where is this convention explained ? %ENDCOLOR%). 

To check that the various information providers are
reporting to ML, go to the !TabPan view (on the left hand menu bar) and
check that all of the table entries for your site are providing
information. If there are "Unknown" entries
in the fields, then most likely there is error in the ML configuration
files you modified.&nbsp; Please go through the instructions and
contact your local [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ops/][Support Center]] if you need help. 

---+++ Configure MDS (GRIS)

The Globus information system is called MDS and is preconfigured to read the grid3-info.conf information file. One may (optionally) start the Globus information service daemon (GRIS) with the following command (as root):

<pre>
# <b>/etc/init.d/gris start</b>
</pre> 

To test the GRIS, first you need an <a href="#Get_an_LDAP_service_certificate">LDAP service certificate</a> which needs to be owned by the user daemon.
<pre>
# <b>chown -R daemon /etc/grid-security/ldap</b>
</pre>
Then use your user account and proxy generated by <b>grid-proxy-init</b> to test the GRIS by running

<pre>
# <b>grid-info-search -h your.fully.qualified.hostname</b>
</pre>

---++ Installing Client Software

You may wish to install the VDT-Client package to get some additional Grid client tools (!GSIOpenSSH, !UberFTP, the Condor !ClassAds library, !PyGlobusUrlCopy, and Netlogger).

<pre>
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/%OSG_ITB_VDT_CACHE%:VDT-Client
</pre>

---++ Site Verification

Now you're ready to run the full CE site verification test suite. All elements of this test should now pass.

(Remember: To run the site verify script you should not be *root* )

<tt>
$ cd $VDT_LOCATION<br>
$ source ./setup.sh<br>
$ grid-proxy-init <br>
Enter "<i>Your Passphrase</i>"<br>
$ cd verify<br>
$ perl site_verify.pl --host=<i>hostname.domain.tld</i><br>
</tt>

---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to OsgCEAuthorization and authorize other users before registering your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!) 

---++ OSG Registration

To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the webform located [[http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=68&elMenu=Grid%20Support][here]].


---++ Firewalls

Grid components are distributed throughout the network, and services 
such as gatekeepers and data movement utilties are required to be 
accessible to the dynamic cloud of clients and peer services.
This ditributed and dynamic requirement places the burden
of the security on the implementation of the application.

Due to the discovery of significant vulnerabilities in recent years, network-based applications are untrusted by default. To solve the application
problem effort has focused on developing and deploying firewalls which
restricts full and free network access.  (You might say that this is analogous to building 
a house with no doors. Is it safe? Yes. Is it useful? No.)

Some essential network-based applications have been
"hardened," such as mail relay services, web servers, and secure
shell daemons. These are further protected further by IP address 
filtering to prevent access from unknown hosts or domains.

Grid components which are located behind network firewall 
face special challenges for Grid setup and operations. 

There are two styles of firewalls usually encountered. 

	* A network firewall which is upstream from your server 
(usually centrally maintained). This blocks all traffic to your 
host. 

	* Host-based firewalls which are setup and maintained 
by individual host administrators. This is usually setup and configured
by the <b>iptables</b> program which filters incoming network packets which 
arrive for the host.

 In addition to host-based firewalls, hosts can choose to 
 implement host based access rules (usually setup with the <b>tcp_wrapper</b>
  or <b>hosts_allow</b> utilties.

Network traffic can be blocked at the firewall for both incoming and outgoing dataflow
depending on hostnames, ip addresses, ports and protocols. 


A common setup is to allow any outgoing connection,
while significantly (if not completely) restricting 
incoming connections.  The Globus project provides thorough documentation on this subject which will not be repeated here.  It is strong encouraged that you read the document <A HREF="http://www.globus.org/security/v2.0/firewalls.html">Globus Toolkit Firewall Requirements</A> to avoid issues which may arise from firewall configuration.


IP port usage which may require firewall updates:

	* MDS: 2135/tcp
	* GRAM: 2119/tcp
	* GridFTP: 2811/tcp
	* GRAM callback: contiguous range if tcp ports as specified by definition <b>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=start,stop</b> .  A minmun range of 100 for a small site. 
	* Monalisa: 9000/udp (for ABping measurements).  These are specified in the file <B>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/<I>cluster_name</I>/ml.properties</B>
	
GRAM and GridFTP need to know the port range that you've opened up. You need to set two environment variables, GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE. Some people set these in the xinetd configuration, but you can also set it in $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh. Then these will be used by GRAM, GridFTP, and any clients that require them. This file is only present in VDT 1.3.5. 

By the way, the VDT is working on a better solution for setting these variables, and it will hopefully be in an upcoming VDT release. 

These ports and protocols <i>must be open</i> to all grid clients and
server machines participating in the grid in order to provide minimal
functionality.

You also may need to open the following optional ports for additional Grid services:

	* GIIS: 2136/tcp
	* GSISSH: 22/tcp
	* MyProxy: 7512/tcp
	* VOMS: 8443/tcp
	* RLS server: 39281/tcp

Here is a sample of the a /etc/hosts.allow with the GLOBUS services opened:
<verbatim>

# cat /etc/hosts.allow
#
# hosts.allow	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#					allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#					by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#
sshd: 129.79.6.113 
ALL : localhost
vdt-run-gsiftp.sh : ALL
vdt-run-gsiftf2.sh : ALL
vdt-run-globus-gatekeeper.sh : ALL
</verbatim>

*For RH9, RHEL3 or compatible iptables systems*

The default firewall configuration for Red Hat's iptables sets the system up with a stateful packet filter. This is different than some legacy RH7 systems as by default no ports that are not explicitly opened by the iptables script will be open. This includes high numbered ports that are often used by grid services. 

If your preference is to leave as much of the stateful packet filtering in place but enable just those grid services you want to deploy then you can use the following instructions. 

Two changes need to be made to an OSG gateway with a host based iptables stateful firewall. 

First is the configuration of the firewall itself. On RHEL or similar systems this is done in /etc/sysconfig/iptables

The Chain RH-Firewall-1-INPUT is a default chain for RHEL3. This chain is also sometimes called INPUT. Make sure the following rules use the chain that other rules in /etc/sysconfig/iptables do. 

Note: For GSISSH this port is often already open for systems. You can use either this rule or the default rule setup at install time if you selected custom firewall and enabled ssh. 

<verbatim>
# Globus: Requires addition configuration in /etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper
# set: env = GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,50000
# This allows up to 10,000 ports and matches the globus config.
# How globus is configured to use these ports is subject to change in an upcoming
# release
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 40000:50000 -j ACCEPT
# Monalisa, grabs 3 ports from the following range
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9000:9010 -j ACCEPT
# Gridftp
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2811 -j ACCEPT
# MDS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2135 -j ACCEPT
# GRAM
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2119 -j ACCEPT

# Optional Services
# RLS Server
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 39281 -j ACCEPT
# MyProxy
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 7512 -j ACCEPT
# GSISSH/SSH
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# GIIS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2136 -j ACCEPT
# GUMS/VOMS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
</verbatim>


Second is the configuration of globus to use the above port range. _This may change in upcoming VDT releases, see above_


/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper
<verbatim>
service globus-gatekeeper
{
			socket_type = stream
			protocol = tcp
			wait = no
			user = root
			instances = UNLIMITED
			cps = 400 10
			server = $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-run-globus-gatekeeper.sh
			env	 = GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,50000
			disable = no
}
</verbatim>

You should probably also add the port range to $VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/globus-job-manager.conf, 
to be sure it's always picked up, by adding the following line:

<verbatim>
		  -globus-tcp-port-range 40000,50000
</verbatim>

_Note: $VDT_LOCATION should be set by the pacman installer_

After editing the above files run the following commands

<verbatim>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables restart
Flushing firewall rules:											  [  OK  ]
Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter						  [  OK  ]
Unloading iptables modules:										  [  OK  ]
Applying iptables firewall rules:								  [  OK  ]
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload
Reloading configuration:											  [  OK  ]
# 
</verbatim>
