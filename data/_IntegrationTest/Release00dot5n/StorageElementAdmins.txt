---++ Introduction
This page contains how-to guides and other necessary information for ITB Testers who are either setting up a Storage Element or testing a Storage Element Implementation.

*What is a Storage Element ?* 
		
		A SE on OSG is a node/cluster of nodes which

	* Satisfies OSG Requirements Integration.LocalStorageRequirements
	* Provides Storage Space.
	* Is accessible to applications running on OSG through either gridftp and/or srm interface. 
	* Has GIP setup and configured properly which publishes its information.
	* Has well-defined policy for cleanup and usage.
	* Is registered with OSG.

---++ How to Test SE Implementation
		SRM-TESTER is available to test SRM based storage sites as well as popular file transfer protocol such as gsiftp, http or ftp, based storage sites. SRM-TESTER is integrated into the Integration.GridCat and also available as a stand-alone tester. SRM-TESTER can be installed through VDT pacman, or downloadable from http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist.
