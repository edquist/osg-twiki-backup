*UNDER CONSTRUCTION!*

---++Introduction
The Grid Exerciser (GEx) is a grid diagnostic and monitoring tool.  The GEx is currently run by the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Condor Project]] at the University of Wisconsin on [[http://www.ivdgl.org/grid3/ Grid3]] and the OSG [[http://www.ivdgl.org/osg-int/ Integration Testbed]] (ITB).  Though the GEx can be run from any site against any grid.

The GEx has these goals:

	* By providing a continuous stream of jobs for all sites on a grid, the GEx provides a continuous diagnostic capability for identifying errors, primarily when jobs don't run at all, or jobs abort with errors.

	* Second, the GEx provides a continuous _backfill_ load upon all sites in the grid.

When sites are configured correctly, GEx jobs run at the lowest priority. and directly indicate the unused computing capacity for a site.  Ideally, the GEx should accumulate a low level of successful run time at a site.  A net run time of zero indicates a problem, either with the GEx or the site.  A high run time indicates the site is either lightly loaded, or a problem prioritizing GEx jobs.

---++Site Loading Algorithm
Currently the GEx attempts to maintain a load of _N_ submitted jobs at each site, where _N_ is the minimum of the number of CPUs reported for the site by the [[http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/ GridCat]], or 10.  The latter is the current arbitrary limit for the maximum number of simulaneous jobs per site. The job itself is essentially a script wrapper around "sleep 900", and outputs other useful environment information to stdout and stderr.  The GEx job itself should result in little to no CPU load.

TODO: There is a pending change [below] to only submit jobs to sites that are identified as "active" in the GridCat.

---++GEx User Identity
The GEx runs from the GRIDEX VO, gridex user, with the certificate subject
<verbatim>
/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Alan De Smet 489066
</verbatim>
but will soon migrate to the new certificate
<verbatim>
/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Jeff Weber (Grid Exerciser) 365339
</verbatim>

TODO: What GEx user id(s) for sites with dynamic accounts?  How does this work with GUMs?

---++Configuring Site Policy for GEx Jobs
It is intended that each sites configures GEx jobs to run as backfill jobs.  This is done by configuring GEx jobs to run at the _poorest possible priority_.  Here are suggestions for accomplishing this for the various OSG job managers:

See
http://www.ivdgl.org/documents/document_server/uploaded_documents/doc--782--fair.html

---+++Condor
The Condor administrator should set a high user priority factor for the local GEx Condor user id(s).  A high user priority factor should be at least an order of magnitude larger than the number of CPUs available at the site.
<verbatim>
% condor_userprio -setfactor gridex 1000000
</verbatim>

Condor will always use this user priority factor to create a large (poor) effective user priority for the GEx user(s).  This is a persistent configuration change to Condor.

---++Pending GEx Changes:
	* Update to use new certificate
	* Modify GEx to dynamically restart each TBD period, and read GridCat at the start of each run.  Currently, site list is queried by script from GridCat, GEx is (re)started by hand.
	* Add interpretation of new GridCat status bit: only submit jobs to "active" sites, but log "inactive", "unknown" sites.  Note that a latency occurs from when the site status is updated in the GridCat until the GEx responds to the new status.

	* Publish most recent OSG-ITB report online similar to latest [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~adesmet/ge/results.txt Grid3]] report.

	* Add verification of job stdout and stderr

	* Increase maximum number of simultaneous jobs per site.  The current limit of up to 10 simultaneous jobs per site is an arbitrary starting point.  This limit is
arguably quite small when compared to sites with hundreds or thousands of CPUs, and  hampers the GEx goal of providing a realistic backfill load upon each site.  However, this limit has still caused issues with some site.  Until these issues are all understood and remedied, the current limit will remain unchanged.
