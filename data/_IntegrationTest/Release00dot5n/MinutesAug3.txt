---++ Agenda

   * New VDT 1.3.11 release: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.11/release.html
   * Information systems issues - discussion
   * OSG 0.5.0 packages
   * Upgrading an OSG 0.4.1 site with a CEMon service
   * AOB
     
---++ VDT release
   * 1.3.11 is out!
   * http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.11/release.html
   * Configuring squid caches: should work out of the box.  Larger question - which machine should it be on, how are apps informed?
      * Installation - on gatekeeper?  Squid uses lots of memory.
      * Could put squid location into the job environment.
      * What about CRL updates from workernodes.  Not hard to setup.
      * Is squid it a requirement? where does it sit? how do apps know about it?  --- these are the big questions.   Need some scalability tests.
      * Develop some recommendations as we gain experience.      
   * Old version of pacman recommened, but there's no reason.
   * No changes to managed-fork.
   * What about new version of voms?  Any reason to encourage VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's to upgrade?  Fermilab is upgrading. 
   * prima-gt4: doesn't seem to be a dependency. Have to enable by hand.

---++ Info system discussion

Leigh:
   * We have several monitoring systems - to avoid overlap, looking into whether the MIS-CI client page which is installed on the CE could be removed.
   * This client has been unstable, especially with regard to NFS-based filesystems.
   * We are relying on this package - it cannot be simply be remove - GridCat relies on it.  (tests with Johns machines)
   * Configure-gip script looks in the MIS-CI directory for the site state bit.
   * There is a larger problem of overlapping job monitoring systems.
 
Michael:
   * Has had a student working on discovery service improvements - and integration of DS with Gridcat. 
   * Have replaced the way Gridcat gets its info.  Listens to Monalisa, dumps into a database.  Still relies on mis-ci scripts running as cron jobs.
   * Future for Gridcat - prototyping now - will discuss at some point.

David:
   * Working with VDS and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS to aggregate information from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS.
   * Note - VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS does not use MIS-CI.

Questions:
   * Are the mis-ci scripts run by default by Gridcat? (rather than pulling from the database?)
   * Is this in the configuration of Gridcat server?  Its in the Global gridcat configuration.
   * Should the site state bit ("I'm open for business") be moved into the operations area?  Not suitable for scheduled outtage.
   * Are we deprecating MIS-CI?
   * Perhaps put this into Glue schema 1.3.

Burt:
   * Should we decouple the information service from the CE?
   * Still need an easy switch for site admins to update BDII information.

Recommendations:
   * Will continue to support mis-ci for the short term, but...
   * Monitoring group should come up with a plan for the longer term.
   * Operations - do have plans to have a scheduled outtage posting service for sites scheduling downtimes, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS.
   * Iowa will build a package to remove dependencies and publish through GIP; schedule this for VDT 1.3.12.  Will send email to Gabriele for requirements.

---++ OSG 0.5.0 packages
   * Easiest way to incorporate by putting CEMon on the same host as the CE. 
   * Note that CEMon is configured automatically, but not started/run by default. 
   * Start out by putting CEMon in CE; note it adds apache and tomcat, installs CEMon as a container in apache. 
   * To run, you will need to move it into /etc/initd./ by hand.
   * Timeframe for a ce package - we're still making decisions - but by Monday we can have a full complement of 0.5.0 packages.

---++ Upgrading an OSG 0.4.1 site with a CEMon service
   * What would it take to test "updating" a 0.4.1 with a version of CEMon from 0.5.0?
   * Steve: can someone put a sepeparate package out, so as not to mix 1.3.11 on top of a 1.3.10 distribution.
   * Alain: dependencies are not so clear.  configure-cemon script, another library.  Install in a separate directory, then "hook up".
   * Don't know how to do the hook-up to 0.4.1 GIPs.  Would need to change the configuration by hand if you wanted to use the older GIPs.  
   * Will need new environment variables.
   * There are apache and tomcat - not a problem if you didn't have before.

To do:

   * Steve has a machine that can try this out on an ITB site with 0.4.1.
   * Configure CEMon to point to the old GIP.
   * Other volunteers? Iowa - can work on this as well. 

---++ AOB
   * Condor 6.7.20 bugs?  For sites using Quill and managed-fork.
   * Rob Quick is putting to the basic instructions for 0.5.0.
   * Leigh will make a separate package for CEMon for 0.4.1 testing. 
   * GUMS probe - check whether a GUMS service is running or not.  Gabriele is working on a fix.
