---++Introduction

If MyProxy is a credential repository that stores long-term proxies of end users and provides derived short-term proxyies upon request. I.e. a typical use-case is to initialize the MyProxy server with one's end-entity certificate and private key from one's own workstation, and later retrieve a delegated proxy from the MyProxy server to use on a machine where one does not have access to their own certificate and private key.
<p>
The Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server in turn is an attribute server that provides users upon request with their attributes by embedding them in the user's proxy certificate durin proxy certificate initialization.
<p>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (UPDATED 2005-05-21): Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and MyProxy can interoperate if MyProxy is instructed to only create/use legacy globus proxies (where the DN is extended with CN=proxy for every delegation step). This can be achieved by setting an environment variable of "GT_PROXY_MODE=old" in the shell where the MyProxy client tools are used. <p>
Two general usage scenarios are possible. Scenario 1 stores a long-lived general-purpose proxy in MyProxy and the user, upon retrieval of a derived proxy, adds Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes before usage. Scenario 2 stores multiple customized Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS proxies in MyProxy and the user retrieves a delegation of the proxy with the desired Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/role attribute.<p>
INTEROPERABILITY WITH PRIMA:  in the current versions of PRIMA (0.2) if MyProxy is used in either scenario the PRIMA module will not validate the attribute certificate as it expects the attribute certificate to be bound to the issuer (cert) of the proxy certificate that was used for authentication. I like the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS solution of binding the attribute certificate to the end-entity certificate better and we will adjust the next release of PRIMA (0.3) to accomodate this use-case and accept such attribute certificates. Further more, attribute validation on the gatekeeper side is not required if the GUMS server is used as the GUMS server has a complete replica of all authorized group and role memberships from the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS databases. Thus this validation step may be disabled.
<p>

As noted above there are two possible ways of how Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and MyProxy can be used together:

---+++ SCENARIO ONE - long term proxy in MyProxy (do MyProxy before Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS)

<b>This is the desired operation IMO!</b>
<p>
1. Initialize MyProxy with your end-entity credential (myproxy-init)<br>
2. retrieve a short term proxy from MyProxy (myproxy-get)<br>
3. retrieve a Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attribute by using the voms-proxy-init tool with 
   your desired Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/role and using the previously retrieved proxy from 
   MyProxy as your input to voms-proxy-init <br>
<p>
Part of this could be scripted, mainly steps 2 and 3 can be abstracted 
and the user only needs to execute a script that does these two steps. 
Only the MyProxy password would be required. Basically the MyProxy proxy
would be "customized" with the appropriate attribute just before it would
be put to use.

---+++ SCENARIO TWO - many specialized proxies (one per VO) in MyProxy

This approach would require to <br>
1. get a proxy with a Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMs attribute <br>
2. insert this proxy into MyProxy with a handle identifying the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/role <br>
3. retrieve the proxy from MyProxy on the desired machine with a username/password
combination that fits the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/role<br>
<p>
If this approach is taken then the management of proxies in MyProxy becomes a
dounting (scary) task for the user as he has to provision a proxy for every possible
Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/role combination up front to MyProxy and have a different username/password
for each proxy. 


---++Test Environment

To test the integration between Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and MyProxy and the two above noted scenarios
I installed a MyProxy server using VDT 1.3.5 on cmssrv17.fnal.gov that accepts any
doegrids certificate and allows retrieval from any host if proper username/password are given.

To install I did:
1. upgrade to packman 1.3.1
2. pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache:MyProxy -pretend-platform:linux-rhel
3. modify /opt/vdt/globus/etc/myproxy-server.config to allow for doegrids certs and
to allow retrieval from any host
4. copy globus/share/myproxy/etc.init.d.myproxy to /etc/init.d and customize it (automatic start at boot is not activated)
5. issue a "myproxy start"

I also installed MyProxy in a VDT 1.3.3 distrib on gyoza7.fnal.gov for testing the clients from a different machine

---++SCENARIO ONE - MyProxy before Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS

UPDATE: This scenario can now be made to work if Globus and MyProxy are forced to only produce/use legacy proxies with the DN attribute CN=proxy added to the DN of the end-entity. <b>To achieve this the environment variable GT_PROXY_MODE=old needs to be
set when the MyProxy commands are used</b>
<p> 
Here the procedure:
<p>
<code><pre>

<p>
If in this scenario we do not have legacy-compatibility mode enabled for MyProxy then the generated standard proxy cannot be processed by Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS. The error message received indicates a socket error which is misleading.  Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is unable to process a new-style proxy certificate as the means of authenticating the user. The voms-proxy-init status output below shows this. Voms-proxy-init is unable to retrieve the user's DN if a new proxy certificate is used as input
"Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Markus Lorch 98196/CN=445535163/CN=1221395140/CN=1294112888"

The Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS proxy init with a VDT 1.3.1 voms client and server failed, while the same command without the use of the myproxy derived proxy succeeds:

<code><pre>
$voms-proxy-init -voms uscms

The same problem exists if the VDT 1.3.5 Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS client and SERVER is used. 



---++SCENARIO TWO - Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS before MyProxy

Summary: This scenario can be made to work. MyProxy is able to accept the 
legacy proxies from Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS as input. However, this scenario is cumbersome to use
as best, requires users to manage many MyProxy accounts and passwords and to
watch over the lifetime of a large number of proxies. 

Here is the procedure I follows, I first verify that I can do a standard proxy
<code><pre>
$unset GT_PROXY_MODE
$unset X509_USER_CERT
$unset X509_USER_KEY

grid-proxy-init -debug -verify

User Cert File: /home/mlorch/.globus/usercert.pem
User Key File: /home/mlorch/.globus/userkey.pem

Trusted CA Cert Dir: /etc/grid-security/certificates

Output File: /tmp/x509up_u9525
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Markus Lorch 98196
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ...++++++++++++
.....++++++++++++
 Done
Proxy Verify OK
Your proxy is valid until: Thu Apr 21 02:02:37 2005
</pre></code>

Second, I get a Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS proxy (overriding the first test proxy)
<code><pre>
$ voms-proxy-init -voms cmssrv17
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Markus Lorch 98196
Enter GRID pass phrase:
Creating temporary proxy ........................................ Done
Contacting  cmssrv17.fnal.gov:15001 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cmssrv17.fnal.gov] "uscms" Done
Creating proxy .................................................... Done
Your proxy is valid until Thu Apr 21 02:03:07 2005
</pre></code>

Now I set the newly created proxy to be my end-entity certificate and key
(thus from now on I am no longer using usercert.pem and userkey.pem from
my .globus directory)

<code><pre>
$ id
uid=9525(mlorch) gid=5063(us_cms) groups=33914,41504,5063(us_cms),5064(globus),9548(gums)
$ export X509_USER_CERT=/tmp/x509up_u9525
$ export X509_USER_KEY=/tmp/x509up_u9525
$ grid-proxy-init -debug -verify

User Cert File: /tmp/x509up_u9525
User Key File: /tmp/x509up_u9525

Trusted CA Cert Dir: /etc/grid-security/certificates

Output File: /tmp/x509up_u9525
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Markus Lorch 98196/CN=proxy
Creating proxy .............++++++++++++
.....++++++++++++
 Done

ERROR: Couldn't verify the authenticity of the user's credential to generate a proxy from.

</pre></code>

This proxy verify failed as the proxy that we got from Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is an old-format proxy.
Now lets switch to old-proxy compatibility mode:

<code><pre>
$ export GT_PROXY_MODE=old
$ grid-proxy-init -debug -verify

User Cert File: /tmp/x509up_u9525
User Key File: /tmp/x509up_u9525

.........++++++++++++
 Done
Proxy Verify OK

Warning: your certificate and proxy will expire Thu Apr 21 02:03:07 2005
 which is within the requested lifetime of the proxy
</pre></code>

Inject the old-style proxy from Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS into myproxy via delegation:
<code><pre>
$ myproxy-init -c 5
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Markus Lorch 98196/CN=proxy/CN=proxy
Creating proxy ................................... Done
Proxy Verify OK
Your proxy is valid until: Wed Apr 20 19:05:37 2005
Enter MyProxy pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter MyProxy pass phrase:
A proxy valid for 5 hours (0.2 days) for user mlorch now exists on cmssrv17.fnal.gov.
</pre></code>

Retrieve this proxy (overriding the original one) and verify with
voms-proxy-info -all

<code><pre>
$ myproxy-get-delegation
Enter MyProxy pass phrase:
A proxy has been received for user mlorch in /tmp/x509up_u9525

$ voms-proxy-info -all
error = 5025

</code>

Voila, eventually we are back were we started ... we got a Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS proxy that was
delegated 5 times in the process. :)

I have tested this process several times by loading different voms proxies with changing Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo affiliation and lifetimes into MyProxy ... this seems to work.
