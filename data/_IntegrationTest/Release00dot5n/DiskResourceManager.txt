---++Introduction
The DRM Disk Resource Manager is grid middleware that allows you to add an SRM interface on top of any normal unix filesystem. Version 1.2 of the DRM service supports v1.1 of the SRM protocal. For more information on DRM please refer to the [[https://plone3.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/activities/DRM/docs/][documentation section]] on the OSG plone for the DRM Trash/Deployment Activity. 
---++Installation
To install the DRM you will need to decide how and from where you want to offer your storage resources to the grid. DRM can be deployed on the same host as the CE or it can be deployed on a seperate host. We will make specific recomendations for this as we gain experiance testing and validating the service in the readiness and integration phase of our tests. At this time the only installation procedure under way is that which deploys the service on the same server as the CE. The proceedure is described  in the [[https://plone3.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/activities/DRM/install/][installation section]] on the plone for the OSG DRM Trash/Deployment Activity. 
---++Validation
The validation procedure is currently under development in the DRM Trash/Deployment Activity under its readiness plan. 
---++Integration Plans
We are currently working on the DRM readiness activity and plan to complete that before we request for for a full integration on to the OSG-ITB integration testbed. An half day installation fest for a subset of ITB sites has been scheduled for Wednesday March 16, 2005. The goals for the fest and meeting summaries of past meeting are available from the DRM Trash/Deployment plone's [[https://plone3.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/activities/DRM/install/][meetings section]]
