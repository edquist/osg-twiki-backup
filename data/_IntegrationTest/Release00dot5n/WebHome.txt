---+Introduction

---++Integration Objectives and Scope
This OSG Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, and establishes a framework for releases. 

---++Call for Contributions
The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG integration activities.
It is intended to be a resource available to (and editable by) OSG users. If you have a problem, trying using the 'Search' link below.  The principle is simple though - click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of this page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').
_Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!_
