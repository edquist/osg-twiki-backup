---++Introduction

---+++!!Integration Objectives and Scope
This OSG Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, and establishes a framework for releases. 

---+++!!Call for Contributions
The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG integration activities. It is a resource available to, and editable by, all OSG users (if you're new, register at TWiki.TWikiRegistration; Leigh will then have to add you to the group with write access). To edit content, click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of any page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').
_Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!_

---++OSG Services

	* The OSGServiceOverview provides an overview and context for the current major service components comprising the OSG integration testbed.

	* NewOSGServices describes the process for integrating new services into the OSG


---++ITB Releases
Here we describe the integration testbed releases.  An ITB release is defined as a set of functionalities that are provide by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), a _VO_ (VO specific services provided by that VO, such as a VOMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB. 

	* [[ItbRel014][ITB 0.1.4 description]]
	* [[ItbRel013][ITB 0.1.3 description]]


---++VO Administrators

This is a lightweight proposal for a [[ItbVo][VO registration procedure]] for VO participants in the ITB.  
This serves two purposes – to let the operations team know some basic contact information for the service, 
and to transmit certain information to the OSG ITB software intergration team to allow VO connection information
to be distributed. 

---++Site Administrators
Information for SiteAdmins including installation instructures for the core infrastructure, 
site regigration procedures, and guidelines for participating in the integration testbed
activity.

---++Visible Testbed and Validation
The OSG ITB undergoes a number of validation tests, provided by applications groups and service providers.

	* The IntegrationTestBed provides a view of the current integration testbed.
	* The ValidationPage is where validation procedures, tools, and results are collected.
