---++ Introduction
The purpose of this topic is to establish best practices for creating the documentation as we go through the integration process. Contributors to these practices include: Forrest Christian, Robert Gardner, Anne Heavey,
David Meyers and John Weigand. 

---++Structuring Conventions
A number of document structuring conventions have been established and need to be maintained.
The following conventions are used in these pages:

   * =mono-spaced text= indicates terminal output
   * ==bold mono-spaced text== indicates terminal input (by the user)
   * =<i>mono-spaced text in italics</i>= indicates variable data that may differ on your installation
   * the =&gt;= prompt indicates commands that do not require a specific shell or root access
   * the =#= prompt indicates commands that require root access
   * the =$= prompt indicates sh- or bash-specific commands
   * the =%= prompt indicates csh- or tcsh-specific commands

---++Versioning Conventions
The ITB version numbers are always in an odd number series (0.3.n, 0.5.n, ...). 
OSG Production version numbers are always in an even number serices (0.4.n, 0.6.n, ...).
Currently the ITB series is 0.5.n. It is expected that the culmination of the ITB series 0.5.n
will result in the Production release of 0.6.n.

---++Version Practice in the "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions"
The "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions"  is a large document with many sections that need to revised repeatedly during the life cycle of software components and services. The practices recommended to 
maintain the CE Installation Instructions are:

1. A single document in the Documentation Table050 for each release of the 
OSG CE 0.5.n software which will be titled: "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions" that will be
edited in-line.

2. A fully versioned sub-section (e.g. OSG 0.5.1) will be created for each incremental release of the 
"OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions" under the section titled: "What's getting installed?" This sub-section
is expected to be an accurate enumeration of each VDT cache version employed (e.g. 1.4.0)
and the version of each component from the VDT (e.g. Condor/Condor-G 6.7.20).
Components that are installed from the OSG cache should also be enumerated here.
Services managed by xinetd, init.d, and cron should be accurately described for each ITB version.

---++Modularization of the "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions"
John Weigand has developed a practice to decompose the "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions"
into a number of modules that can be edited as separate components. In the "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions" one will notice the tag "Edit this section". These tags support the modular editing of the section so tagged. John will document the practices under development surronding this work in the future.
