---++Introduction

VO's have a number of responsibilities in OSG for organizing their work and their use of the Grid. The most fundamental of these is to maintain the list of their members and what roles they may play withing the organization. Within OSG, the method of maintaining this information is through a VOMS service.  A VOMS service provides two functionalities:  it provides a list of DN's of VO members for use in creating a gridmapfile, and it provides an attribute service where it creates signed attributes asserting that the bearer can play the specified role within the VO.  

The Privilege Project has bundled a number of component to help setting up and maintaining a VOMS service as well as components to utilize the VOMS attributes.  A detailed description of all of the elements and how they relate can be found at <URL>

---++Recommendations

We recommend that all VOs update to this release's VOMS service if they are running a VOMS version earlier than XXX. This solves a number of potential interoperability problems as well as provides the option of using roles within the VO. VO managers will need to use either the VOMS-Admin interfaces or the VOMRS service to maintain the data within the VOMS database.

VOs that desire to use role based authorization, need to distribute the VOMS client tools to their users and teach them how to use them (eg. what the roles are within the VO, etc.). Users need to attach the attributes they wish to assert to their proxy by using the voms-proxy-init command. This
command is used to contact the VOMS server and extend the grid proxy with the user's attributes.
This information must be presented with the users request in order for services to make role based decision.

Sites wishing to use VO membership and roles to do uid mapping (for example, to use a pool of accounts), need to install the PRIMA modules on their gatekeeper and one GUMS server per site.
The PRIMA modules parse the attributes and pass them to the GUMS server for a mapping to a local userid.	Sites that do not wish to support attribute based decisions, may still find GUMS useful as a 
centrally maintained gridmap file.

---++Strategic Direction

Maintenance of gridmapfiles is a large portion of the current grid site maintenance. In the era where all users obtain VOMS attributes as part of their grid proxy, then sites receiving requests for service have reliable statements of VO membership embedded in the requesters proxy. Using a mapping of all VO members onto a single local userid, or use of GUMS to manage assignment from a pool of local accounts, allows a grid service to not need to maintain a gridmap for that VO.
