---+!!<nop>Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Release Notes
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction
This page provides information related to specific Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS releases as best as we know them. 

---++Interoperability Issues
<b>5/26/2005</b> - The following was provided by Vincenzo Ciaschini (vincenzo.ciaschini@cnaf.infn.it):
   * The GT2/GT3 patch only applies to the client utils (voms-proxy-*), so you can
      use them to contact older versions of the server.   
   * v1.4.x clients are compatible with v1.5.x servers
      * One caveat, though. 
       Since the patch was about the proxy certificate used to contact the server ,  if you specify 
       the --noregen option of voms-proxy-init you are not taking advantage of it.  

---++Release 1.6 (in development)
The following bugs/changes are being addressed in Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS v1.6:

   * <a href:"http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=5834">Bug 5834</a> 
       Misleading error messages on Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS database access.<br>
       The orginal problem identified with the bug was a problem with the installation scripts which was fixed a long time ago.
        The open problem addresses  the misleading error message that is generated whenever Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS has a problem 
         accessing the database.  This message is generated for any failure on db access such as wrong db name, wrong username, 
          wrong password, mysql server not running, etc.
    <verbatim>
     Detected DB version: 0
     Required DB version >= 1
     [FAILED] 
    </verbatim>
   More meaninful error messages are forthcoming in v1.6.

   * <a href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=5856">Bug 5856</a>
      Misleading/confusing voms-proxy-init error  messages.<br>
        One of the original problems identified in this bug related to a bad vomses.template file has been resolved.  The confusing
        error messages coming from a bad vomses file used by the voms-proxy-init script is being addressed..


---++Release 1.5
---+++1.5.0: 
This version (based on 1.4.1) includes support for Oracle DBs, as well as MySql Ds <br>
 Clients  (voms-proxy-*) from 1.4.x are compatible.

MySQL DBs from 1.4.x may be reused, but need to be upgraded 
through the update1to2 script, distributed along with the server.

At least one of voms-mysql or voms-oracle should be installed.

---+++1.5.1:
No noticeable differences for the users.  Some changes to the build 
       infrastructure for gLite.

---+++1.5.2:
This version includes the GT2/GT3 compatibility patch, plus the logging
 of the user's certificate serial number.

---++Release 1.4
---+++1.4.0
Correction to the ASN1 format of ACs, to make it conformant  to the relevant RFC.  <br>
This means that this version is incompatible  with previous ones.

       countless bugfixes.

       N.B: due to a bug, this version identifies itself as version 1.3.x,
            compiled on 4 March 2005

---+++1.4.1
 mixed bugfixes.

       The incompatibility among 1.4.0 and previous version could be "silent", 
       e.g. not printed when doing voms-proxy-init.  1.4.1 instead prints an 
       error message.

---+++1.4.2
Ignore this version

---+++1.4.3
 This version include the GT2/GT3 compatibility patch

Unless show-stopping problems are found. the 1.4.x series stops here.
