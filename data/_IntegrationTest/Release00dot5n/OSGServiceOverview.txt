---++GT4 Services
Various services from GT4 available at GlobusOSG.

The bundle includes Globus, Condor, VOMS and other services.  Included in VDT 1.3.3 and later is the Globus 4 version of GridFTP.

---+++Grid Cat

---+++BDII and GLUE
Discussions regarding OSG-specific uses of BDII and issues of GLUE schema are availble at GlueOSG.

---+++Discovery Service 
The discovery service provides a registry for publishing and querying grid services. It has similar functionality to a UDDI registry but provides a more lightweight API, xmlrpc accessibility and a much more dynamic and distributed architecture. Service publications can be performed at any instance of the discovery service and the publication will be automatically broadcast to all other instances of the discovery service. This allows clients to locate services from any discovery service instance, regardless of where the initial service publication took place. 

	* Service Readiness Plan for the JClarens-based discovery service is available here: [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]].
	* DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions specific to the OSG are in place.

---++Accounting
Accounting will be provided by MonALISA and ACDC.

---++Storage Services
---+++Disk Resource Manager
The SRM DiskResourceManager product available in the VDT is used to provide a 
storage management interface to disk-based storage resources presented to the OSG.
