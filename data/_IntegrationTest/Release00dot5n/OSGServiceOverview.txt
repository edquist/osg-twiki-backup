%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%

---++Pacman
The PacmanTool is used for installing the core infrastructure and many of the other OSG services.
---++Virtual Data Toolkit
The VirtualDataToolkit (VDT) is the basic middlewaare platform for the OSG Integration Testbed. 
The bundle includes Globus, Condor, VOMS and other services.  Included in VDT 1.3.3 and later is the Globus 4 version of GridFTP.

---++VO Administrative Services
The VO administrative services are being organized by the Privilege project.  The
PrivilegeOSG web provides a summary of OSG specific information for VO management.


---++Monitoring and Information Services
---+++Core MIS
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (CoreMIS) is being has been successfully deployed during the Integration test bed meeting and is now releasing MIS-CI version 0.2.5. The current version can be obtained: 

<verbatim> 
pacman –get iVDGL:MIS-CI
</verbatim>

---+++Grid Cat
GridCat provides a catalog of site attribute information and results of validation tests.

---+++Monalisa
MonALISA provides a repository of time-sampled information from various sources.

---+++BDII and GLUE
Discussions regarding OSG-specific uses of BDII and issues of GLUE schema are availble at GlueOSG.

---+++Discovery Service 
The discovery service provides a registry for publishing and querying for grid services. It has similar functionality to a UDDI registry, but provides a more lightweight API, xmlrpc accessibility, and a much more dynamic and distributed architecture. Service publications can be performed at any instance of the discovery service, and the publication will be automatically broadcast to all other instances of the discovery service. This allows clients to locate services from any discovery service instance, regardless of where the initial service publication took place. 

	* Discussions for the JClarens-based discovery service are available here [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]].

---++Accounting
Discussions between Dane Skow, Matteo Melani, and Marco Mambelli regarding initial work on OSG accounting systems are summarized here.
	* Step 1:  Recover Grid3 functionality. Assuming that MonALISA will be installed on all OSG 0.2 ComputeElements, then what is required is to revive MDViewer. Marco is working on that now and hopes to complete this in ~2wks in time for the next ITB release.
	* Step 2:  Provide some basic information about Storage Elements.  For purposes of basic accounting we will track two quantities: a) total available storage (1 number of Gigabytes),
b) storage used by VO.  This information will be collected via MonALISA via some standard format exchange. The goal is to see if this exchange format can be common with feeds to MIS-CI and GRIS.  Matteo is working on this with Marco and the LBL PDSF team.
	* Step 3: Revive accounting activity at requirements/design stage (current status captured by the December document) sometime around midApril.  We suggest this be started as an activity around that time. Work on that deferred until steps 1 & 2 complete.


---++Storage Services
---+++Disk Resource Manager
The SRM DiskResourceManager product available in the VDT is used to provide a 
storage management interface to disk-based storage resources presented to the OSG.
