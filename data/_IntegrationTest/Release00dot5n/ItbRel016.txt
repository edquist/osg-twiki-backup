%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.1.6, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). We expect this release will be likely picked up by the OSG Provisioning Activity for large scale deployment (at least we hope so).
   * Guides for site and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators are provided below. 
   * This release of the ITB will incorporate major changes in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/%OSG_ITB_VDT_CACHE6%/index.html][VDT %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION6%]]
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo services should be registered using the [[ItbVo][VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration]] procedure.
   * A new MIS-CI release, version 0.2.6RC2, is included,
   * Generic Information Providers (GIP) from LCG

---+++!! Release version indicator

---+++PRIMA Authorization (PRIMA-GUMS-VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS) Issues

   * Service/host  (e.g.  CN of certificate is CN=service/host.site.com)  problem in PRIMA/GUMS.  See ([[ServiceHostCertGumsProblem]] ) for details.<br>
     <b>Work Around:</b> %GREEN%In the wildcard attribute of the hostGroup element of the gums.config file, force GUMS to match  on the service part of the DN. In the example, below, this is the word 'host'.  The caveat here is that any gatekeeper node requesting authorization will be allowed access. <br>
     e.g.  wildcard="*.fnal.gov,host", will match on all fnal.gov requests and any from 'host'.<br>
     (Main.GabrieleCarcassi - 4/29/2005)<br>%ENDCOLOR%
      <b>Resolution:</b> Will be fixed in GUMS 1.1.0, which will be in VDT 1.3.7 - per Gabriele Carcassi%ENDCOLOR%<br>
      (Main.JohnWeigand - 5/31/05)

   * VOs and subgroups containing an underscore character (e.g. ppd_theory) are not being 
       accepted by GUMS.  The problem was identified  when GUMS was retrieving members
       for a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called ppd_astro. (Main.JohnWeigand - 6/1/05) <br>
       <b>Work-around: </b> %GREEN%The only site currently using underscore in the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name/group are in the fermigrid environment and they have agreed to change the names.  Consistency in validation of all elements of an FQAN (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/group/subgroup/role) across VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/GUMS is still required to fully resolve the issue.%ENDCOLOR% Main.JohnWeigand - 03 Jun 2005<p>
       <b>Resolution: </b> Still under review by Gabriele Carcassi.<br>
        <b>Symptom:</b>The retrieval from the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server for the ppd_astro vo was 
       successful, but GUMS failed to update its database with the following error in the 
        gums-service-admin.log:
         <verbatim>
31 May 2005 21:02:34,268 [WARN ]: VOMSGroup:

      (syntax: /VO[/group[/subgroup(s)]][/Role=role][/Capability=cap])]
         </verbatim>

   * %BLACK% Need policy instructions on minimal GUMS config (Steve Timm)--minimal GUMS config is included in gums-service package now and instructions are available Anne Heavey Working on this May 20,2005 Dan Yocum contacting VOs for policy.    Plan is also to have a minimal default configuration for folks who do not reply.<br>
   *Partial resolution*:Anne H provided instructions in GumsConfigStepByStep, but hasn't addressed policy issues (5/27/05.)

---+++VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Specific Issues
   * In the VDT 1.3.6  VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS cache the  ==edg-crl-upgrade== daemon package is missing.   This should probably affect those installing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS for the first time or if another VDT package has been installed on the host and the ==crl_upgrade== daemon is needed.<p>
   To verify, check for ==VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/edg-crl-upgrade==.  You should also verify that it is set to start on boot by the existence of  ==/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded==.<p>
    <b>Work-around:</b>%GREEN% Install the VDT EDG-CRL-Update cache.  It can be installed  without shutting down any other services.%ENDCOLOR%<br>
    <b>Resolution:</b> Will be added to the VDT 1.3.7 release. [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/support/tickets/619.html][VDT ticket 619]]<br>
   Main.JohnWeigand - 16 Jun 2005

---+++GUMS Specific Issues
   * In the VDT 1.3.6  GUMS cache the  ==edg-crl-upgrade== daemon package is missing.   This should probably affect those installing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS for the first time or if another VDT package has been installed on the host and the ==crl_upgrade== daemon is needed.<p>
   To verify, check for ==VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/edg-crp-upgrade==.  You should also verify that it is set to start on boot by the existence of  ==/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded==.<p>
    <b>Work-around:</b>%GREEN% Install the VDT EDG-CRL-Update cache.  It can be installed  without shutting down any other services.%ENDCOLOR%<br>
    <b>Resolution:</b> Will be added to the VDT 1.3.7 release. [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/support/tickets/619.html][VDT ticket 619]]<br>
   Main.JohnWeigand - 16 Jun 2005

---+++VDT Installation Issues

   * Conflict with PERL 32 bit libraries and 64 bit PERL on x86_64 machines.<br>
     <b>Work Around:</b> Put a 32 bit PERL first in the execution path before performing the pacman get. (Not yet reported as successfully done)
     (Main.DaneSkow - 6/2/2005)<br>
     <b>Work Around verification:</b> Even after building the 32 bit PERL, and placing in the execution path, pacman will still fail due to most of the scripts, Globus in particular, have defined a default perl location of /usr/bin/perl.  A second work around is to replace the location on the top of each string with /usr/bin/env perl. (Main.ChristoperBaumbauer - 11/14/2005)<br>
      <b>Resolution:</b> %RED% VDT working on more persistent solution.%ENDCOLOR%<br>
   * GIP configuration wrapper =$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/libexec/lcg-info-wrapper= did not contain the full path to the configuration file.  This prevented the general site configuration from showing up in the BDII server.  I'm not sure if this is a general problem, or something that was specific to the CIT_CMS_OSG site installation.<br>
     <b>Workaround:</b> %GREEN%Edit the script and insert the full path to =lcg-info-generic.conf= %ENDCOLOR%
     (Main.MichaelThomas - 10 Jun 2005)
    
---++Guides for Site Administrators
The SiteAdmins web describes how services listed below are installed, configured, and checked
by the site administrators.  The is where, for example, you'll find the "Core Middleware" or "Computing Element" installation instructions.
   * To shut down services prior to the upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
   * For a detailed step-by-step guide to the core installation procedures, see the OSGCEInstallGuide-0.1.6.

---++Guides for GUMS Administrators
The GumsAdmins topic describes how and why to use the Privilege software, GUMS. The broader context is outlined in PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo.

---++Guides for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Administrators
The VoAdmins page provides information for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators.  There are also some pages specific to the authentication / authorization chain available:
   * VoServiceOverview introduces VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, provides some recommendations and discusses strategic direction.
   * VomsWhatToDo describes how to install and configure a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service
   * PrivilegeOSG describes the components of the Privilege Project, of which VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is a part
   * VoServices discusses agendae and action items for OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo coordinators.
   * PrivilegeVOWhatToDo (superseded by VomsWhatToDo).
   * OsgCEAuthorization describes the OSG-supported authorization scenarios.
   * GoldenChainDebugging for debugging the privilege components and their interaction.

The [[ItbVo][VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration]] procedure should be used to communicate a *VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo level* service to grid resources (sites/gatekeepers).

---++ MonALISA
MonALISA from VDT is used for this release. 

---++ Privilege and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo services infrastructure
Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release. As of this release, the PRIMA interpretation of extended proxies has been fixed to match the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS usage. Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization decisions is supported as of this release. 
The GUMS version should be 1.0.1 from VDT 1.3.6 and the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Server should be installed from the VDT 1.3.6. to ensure correct functioning.

---++ Discovery Service
Description of the 
[[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]]
deployed in this release.  Here are the DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.

The Discovery Service version 0.5.3 is deployed on a JClarens server version 0.5.3 for this OTB release.  Installation of the Discovery Service is optional for the ITB.

---++ Disk Resource Manager

   * We are not recommending installation and use of the disk based storage resource manager, SRM-DRM.
   * Stay tuned to DiskResourceManager for updates.


---++ Site Verify
The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the pacman cache as of this release.


---++ CMS Tier1 SE
The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 interface, with additions for implicit 
space reservation.  CMSSrmdCache provides the readiness plan. The service will be available to all registered OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's.
To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client.  This is available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available and should probably be the version deployed.)

[v1_15 has been announced by Timur on May 13. The recommended version may be the same, needs to be confirmed : Abhishek S R, 05/20/2005]

---++ SRM DRM (Testing)
A disk based storage resource manager from the LBL group.  Integration plan and associated activities are available at SrmDrm.
