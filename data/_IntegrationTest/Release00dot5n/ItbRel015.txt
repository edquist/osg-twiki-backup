From Vijay:
I have started getting these errors in my apache log.
My client is also not working anymore. I don't know what changed. It used to
work before. I will ask Markus since he was doing something on this host

	* %GREEN%PRIMA configuration section in PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo points to off-twiki page <a href="https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege"> https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege</a> which dates from VDT 1.3.1, there are some steps in there that say to modify shell scripts that are no longer necessary.  Summary should be integrated into the twiki and updated.  (Steve Timm 4/20/05) (Actually the direct link is [[https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege/prima-authz-module-setup-in-vdt][here]].)%ENDCOLOR%
	* Under the section "Monalisa and its information providers" in the OSGCoreInstallGuide there's a broken reference to the TabPan view of MonALISA which doesn't seem to exist anymore.  What's the equivalent?  (S. Timm, 4/20/05)
	* %GREEN% OSGShutdownGuide says that the shutdown of MonALISA daemon should be done as user monalisa but if you follow the default instructions, the daemon will be running as user daemon.  I see default instructions have been modified to reflect the choice of user for running MonALISA. I have changed the OSGShutdownGuide to alert the sysadmin that it could be either monalisa or daemon%ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% MonALISA documentation is referenced by three different wikiwords, Monalisa, !MonaLisa, and MonALISA, need to fix,--Fixed (all now MonALISA) (S. Timm 4/20)%ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% New prompt from monitoring/configure-grid3.sh, explanation is needed (S. Timm 4/19/05) %ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% No instructions given to start Core MIS services in general instructions. (Steve Timm) %ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% Core MIS release description is not specific.%ENDCOLOR%
	* Initial pacman-3.11 hardwired to use python binary 'python', which on RH7 is 1.5.2.  To fix, edit
	  python/build_python_if_necessary.py and src/pacman to use the right python (Craig Prescott) --forward this to Saul?
		* (Nate) I don't think Saul can do anything about this.  There's no consistent name for python v2.2 between systems.  Somewhere it's "python", in other places "python2" or "python2.2".  We've run into this with the VDT and you can see our workaround at $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/python2.  Is this causing any problems, or do you just not want to wait for python to be built?
			* (Craig) I understand.  Call me old-fashioned, though, but I don't want an "extra" python installed on my CE if I can avoid it.  I've already got a perfectly good python2.
	* %GREEN% Need policy instructions on minimal GUMS config (Steve Timm)--minimal GUMS config is included in gums-service package now and instructions are available%ENDCOLOR%
	* If condor-from-the-VDT is requested, /etc/init.d/condor is not replaced (Fixed in VDT 1.3.6); for this release, you'll need to start by hand.  Not important (Alain)
	* %GREEN%LDAP service for MDS is mentioned but no mention of what is MDS or why will you ever run it. (Steve Timm) --- until GIP's are available, there is no hard requirement for a running GRIS. A service certificate is required. Translation--MDS for our purposes is the GRIS--correct?  I have noted the equivalence where the GRIS is started, noted that ldap certificate for authenticated MDS is optional where this is mentioned.%ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% No obvious explanation of what orange, red, green mean in the MonALISA display (Steve Timm) orange vo_jobs, mean no jobs running, red means missing grid3 file--I have now added this to the VO Modules section of the MonALISA wiki.%ENDCOLOR%
	* There is no instructions for site admins for creating apps, tmp, data, tmp_wn directories and the correct permissions to apply, also I believe that there should also be a apps/etc directory (Mark Green) --- Leigh will bring old Grid3 instructions forward.
	*  %GREEN% ATLAS validators reported that if /app directory is a symlink on some nodes but not on others, Pacman will expand the symlink on those where it is and get confused on those where it is not....evidently ATLAS is using Pacman to install their validation application.  (Steve Timm 4/20) I fixed my nodes accordingly so /app and /data are straight directories but these instructions should still be noted above
		* (Craig) Why doesn pacman do this?  Naively, this sounds like a pacman bug.%ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN%Provide clear directions on how to install GUMS.-PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo section does not mention that GUMS server isn't installed in default OSG install. (Steve Timm), now this documentation is in GumsAdmins%ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% problem $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt isn't made, in at least 2 different installs. (Steve Timm) I have verified that this fix was made in 0.1.5-2 release.%ENDCOLOR%
	* Not clear when in the install sequence to do the GUMS installation (nate suggests before doing the core installation itself), or how to change from one GUMS source to another.  Core install guide does not mention GUMS at all...
		* Clarification:  I'd suggestion installing VOMS first, then one GUMS server per site and then all the gatekeepers.  This is more of an incremental approach then gatekeeper-VOMS-GUMS and it will let you ensure that all the requirements are in place for each step.  
	* Configure GUMS section is light on details and heavy on redirection.  Too many links to other web sites - would be best to have on a single page in a recipe format.
	* Gotta find some better, more descriptive names for sections.  What the heck is a PrivilegeSite?  Eschew Obfuscation!  
	* %GREEN%Instructions on edg-mkgridmap are wrong in PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo guide, have to fix.  Steve Timm.  Says it's installed automatically but isn't anymore. Documentation now fixed to show that you have to copy the edg-gridmapfile-upgraded to /etc/init.d %ENDCOLOR%
	* %GREEN% Should the dzero VO be included? also who sets the policy for osg on what vo's are in and which ones are out?  (S. Timm) From the recent policy additions to the twiki it is clear that the answer for the ITB is no, it should not be included, that all of the accounts in the list should be made in the ITB setup but there will be a new list in provisioning/deployment which can differ by site both in how many accounts per VO and which VO's.%ENDCOLOR%
	*  After installing VDT1.3.5, first I set a password for root in mysql, then tried to do the GUMS addAdmin. addAdmin failed because it assumed there was no password required for root account. (Doug O.)
		* (Nate again) The VDT has a couple places where people with access to the local box can do bad things.  By default anyone with a login can administer VOMS and muck with the !MySQL server (GUMS, VOMS, RLS).  I brought this up in the past and people weren't too worried.  If that's changed I can bump up the priority of a fix.  For now you can run "configure_apache --secure" and set a password for root@localhost's !MySQL account, but you need to add your first VOMS and GUMS admins first.
	* Until !GridCAT interface issues are resolved by the community, provide direct acces to the !GridCAT mysql database in the same manner as is provided for !Grid3.  This should be done via a "safe" login that has only read-access priviledges. This will enable current users gridcat-mysql to test and debug more effectively on the ITB. (Mike Wilde)
		* (Craig)  The interface issues should be documented, if they aren't already.  For the record, CMS is just fine with the current XML-RPC interface.  I think all grid users would appreciate it if GridCat had the ability to change its underlying MySQL schema without affecting users.  Hiding the MySQL schema behind a web service interface is good and important, even if that interface isn't perfect (my 2 cents).
	* At U Buffalo mama.ccr.buffalo.edu and Fermilab fnpcg.fnal.gov, GT4 !GridFTP server hangs, when conecting via uberftp, with message on client side: "an end-of-file was reached". (Mike Wilde)  Now uberftp into fnpcg.fnal.gov works for me, have fixed tcp wrappers there, please try again.  (Steve Timm).
	* At TTU testwulf.hpcc.ttu.edu, authentication to both GT2 and GT4 server takes between 15 and 25 seconds. Authentication to GRAM (globus-job-run) takes less than 1 second.  All other sites do !GridFTP auth in around one second. (Mike Wilde)
		* (Craig) Confirmed - authenticating to TTU has always been slow; I'm not sure why (shrug).
	* Resolve procedures for sites to correctly set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE for GT4 !GridFTP server. Discussed with Alain Roy, Alain to clarify procedures. (Mike Wilde)
		* (Craig) I believe site admins should put this in their "local" VDT setup script.
	* %GREEN% gris install error message: - 
<verbatim>
Installing /gris.
Adding rc based service: gris
Using init dir at /etc/rc.d/init.d
Don't know how to install the service on this arch
 ERROR: Error setting up GRIS
</verbatim>
(Suresh Singh) %ENDCOLOR%
	* Transient authentication error (to gsiftp 2811 service) simultaneously at IU_iutalas and IUPUI_ITB:
%GREEN% 
<verbatim>
error: globus_ftp_client: the server responded with an error
530 530-Login incorrect. : gridmap.c:globus_gss_assist_map_and_authorize:1483:
530-Error invoking callout
530-globus_callout.c:globus_callout_handle_call_type:714:
530-The callout returned an error
530-prima_module.c:Globus Gridmap Callout:359:
530-Gridmap lookup failure: Identity Mapping Service could not be contacted
530 End.
</verbatim>
%ENDCOLOR%

This was only occurring for a brief time around 2:20 CDT Apr 21, but I'm curious if this is something we need to watch out for in normal operation? It was odd to see an auth failure affect more than one site at a time.  Is this Identity Mapping a shared service between all sites? (Mike W)

	 * (Craig) Fragility of host-based security (hosts.allow) should be remarked upon somewhere (a deployment issue?).  It is an issue that has come up for a long time, since Grid3.  My 2 cents - tcp-wrapper security won't scale when lots of VO users are turned loose on the OSG.

---++Guides for Site Administrators

The SiteAdmins web describes how services listed below are installed, configured, and checked
by the site administrators.  To shut down services prior to the upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
For a detailed step-by-step guide to the core installation procedures, see the OSGCoreInstallGuide.


---++Guides for GUMS Administrators

The GumsAdmins topic describes how and why to use the Privilege software, GUMS. 

* PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo

---++Guides for VO Administrators

The VoAdmins page provides information for VO administrators.  There are also some new pages specific to the authentication / authorization chain available:
	* PrivilegeVOWhatToDo 
	* PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo
	* GoldenChainDebugging for debugging the privilege components and their interaction.

The [[ItbVo][VO registration]] procedure should be used to communicate a VO level service to 
grid resources (sites/gatekeepers). 

---++ Pacman Recommendation
The installation instructions are based on PacmanTool.  For this release, we recommend *Pacman 3.11*.

---++ OSG Core Description
The OSG core installation is done with the Pacman command <verbatim>pacman -get iVDGL:osg-0.1.5.</verbatim> This delivers the following components:

	* Root package: <a href="http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/osg-0.1.5.pacman">osg-0.1.5.pacman</a>
	* Depends on [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/osg-auto-0.1.5.pacman][osg-auto-0.1.5.pacman]] which sets some default answers to VDT configuration questions. It also distributes the OSG Release Notes.

	* Depends on [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/VDT_135.pacman][VDT_135.pacman]]. Installed are three VDT packages:
		* [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache/VDT-Gatekeeper.pacman][VDT-Gatekeeper]]
		* [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache/Globus-Client.pacman][Globus-Client]]
		* [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache/MyProxy.pacman][MyProxy]]
	* Depends on [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/grid3-schema.pacman][grid3-schema.pacman]] which installs the Globus MDS Grid3 schema.
	* Dependent package: [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/osg-grid3-info-prov.pacman][osg-grid3-info-prov.pacman]] which installs the Globus MDS Grid3 information providers.
	* Dependent package: [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/vo-0.1.5.pacman][vo-0.1.5.pacman]] which installs the configurtion script to retrieve VO information.
	* Dependent package: [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/MIS-CI.pacman][MIS-CI.pacman]] which installs the current Monitoring Core Infrastructure descibed below.

---++ VDT
We will use release %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION% of the VirtualDataToolkit %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%, see <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/%OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%/release.html">release notes</a>. 

---++ Globus 4 gridftp

Included with VDT.  The GridFTP page describes the service integration in detail.

---++ Core MIS
Description of the CoreMIS infrastructure to be used.  MIS-CI Version 0.2.5p1  
The Core MIS will be configured by the configure_misci.sh script as a post installation
 step.

---++ Grid Cat
Description of the GridCat site monitoring catalog to be used.

---++ MonALISA
Any special configuration needed for MonALISA for this release, noted here.

---++ Privilege and VO services infrastructure
Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release.
As of this release, the PRIMA interpretation of extended proxies has been fixed to match the VOMS usage.
Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization decisions is supported as of this release (0.1.5) but not in earlier releases.
The GUMS version should be 1.0.1 from VDT 1.3.5 and the VOMS Admin and VOMS Server should be installed from the VDT 1.3.5.
to ensure correct functioning.

---++ Discovery Service
Description of the 
[[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]]
deployed in this release.  Here are the DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.

The Discovery Service version 0.5.3 is deployed on a JClarens server version 0.5.3 for this OTB release.  Installation of the Discovery Service is optional for the ITB.

---++ Disk Resource Manager

	* We are not recommending installtion and use of the disk based storage resource manager, SRM-DRM.
	* Stay tuned to DiskResourceManager for updates.


---++ Site Verify

The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the pacman cache as of this release.


---++ CMS Tier1 SE

The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 interface, with additions for implicit 
space reservation.  CMSSrmdCache provides the readiness plan. The service will be available to all registered OSG VO's.
To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client.  This is available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available and should probably be the version deployed.)
