---++Reports from Sites Installing ITB 0.1.6

   * IU - all went okay
   * OU - not here today
   * UB - not here today
   * BNL_OSG_Test1 - showing gray. Need to set active bit. 
   * CIT - Suresh; upgraded smoothly. Problems with mapping users pool.
   * FNAL_CMST1_TEST - Tim Messers. 
   * UC_Teraport_OSG_ITB - Greg. AMD64/Opteron/SUSE8 went okay after check config fixed.
   * IU_WALLABY - setup okay
   * GRASE-BINGHAMTON - gray
   * UIOWA-ITB - slight problems, already reported to VDT. GUMS is configured, using defaults, reporting to ML.
   * FNAL_GPFARM_TEST - installed okay, leave as gray.
   * UM_ATLAS- showing gray. 

---++ Jobs run on ITB 0.1.6

   * ATLAS - some intermittent jobs.
   * CMS - Bockjoo - as a user, has noticed that some sites do not have enough space.  Needs about 4 GB/project. 

General feeling is that 0.1.6 has not been tested at large scale scale, but that the previous testing from 0.1.5 have carried forward. 

---++Release Candidate Recommendation

   * *Recommendation* is that ITB 0.1.6 is the release candidate for OSG 0.2.1.


---++GIP Configurtion

Feedback to Alain from the ITBon GIP config.

   * Were put in very quickly, lots of room for improvement.
   * Sample config file to edit.  Latest version is very LCG-specific and complicated.
   * YAIM - tool from LCG
      * used for configuration
      * a config script does replacements from a template (a site definition file).
   * Long discussion of how to do this configuration. 
   * What exactly is needed for LCG?

---++BDII Issues

   * A front end to an open ldap server. LCG aggregates GIP information into a single repository.
   * Sites use BDII as a GRIS. 
   * Iowa uses a BDII as a site level GIIS; uses globus MDS as GRIS'.  LCG schedulers use the site BDII.
   * What about authentication?  Not solved in current BDII.
   * Several related 'big' questions about how resources get presented to LCG.
   * There doesn't seem to be a compelling reason to add it to the software cache and OSG 0.2.1 release specification.  It can be done outside of this in a straightforward manner for a few groups.
   * If we need a BDII service for OSG, it shouldn't take too long to do this by hand.

---++ Misc Notes

   * Development of a toolset for a VO, that could be run as ITB testers.
   * Some sites don't have wget from worker nodes.  Not in our specification.
   * Common tools used by LCG are outside our specification.
   * Suggestion that VDT_LOCATION should be mounted on the worker nodes, as well IP connectivity.
   * Where does this type of info live?  Trash/Deployment document.
   * Q: how does a user from a given VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo know how many CPUs he can get? Simple answer for Condor managed sites, hard to get a general answer.


---++ Action Items

   * Need to work on GIP config documentation. (all)
   * CIT - to intall GIP (M. Thomas)
   * Bockjoo - will attempt CMS install on ITB sites, UC Teraport.
   * Issues for OSG service specification (VDT client availability, wget, IP connectivity, etc) need to be captured in the OSG 0.2 Trash/Deployment document.
   * Need to discuss with L. Field what the minimum requirements are for LCG.  Take Iowa's configuration and post. (Showen, Ransom). See GenericInformationProviders.
   * Gabriele will double-check that the reverse mapping instructions are written correctly.
