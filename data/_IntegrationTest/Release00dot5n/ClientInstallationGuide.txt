---++Introduction

for the client installation.</p>

<p> Depending upon your operating system, you may be prompted by the

	RedHat 9
	RedHat Enterprise Linux 3
	Fedora Core 3
	Debian 3.1
	ROCKS 3.3

<pre>VDT 1.3.10 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

	  http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.3.10

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

<pre>The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
		  l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
		  n (no)	 - do not install
</pre>

<p> Press<code>&#160;l&#160;</code>(the letter l) to select the location for the certificates.
</p> 

<p>The client will complete with the following output:</p>

<pre>The VDT version 1.3.10 has been installed.</pre>

You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests. If
you don't have a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a
grid proxy (<code>grid-proxy-init</code>, etc.), contact your <a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&elMenu=Grid%20Support">VO
