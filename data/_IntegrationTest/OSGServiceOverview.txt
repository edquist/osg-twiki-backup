---++Pacman
The PacmanTool is used for installing the core infrastructure and many of the other OSG services.
---++Virtual Data Toolkit
The VirtualDataToolkit (VDT) is the basic middleware platform for the OSG Integration Testbed. 
The bundle includes Globus, Condor, VOMS and other services.  Included in VDT 1.3.3 and later is the Globus 4 version of GridFTP.

---++VO Administrative Services
The VO administrative services are being organized by the Privilege project.  The
PrivilegeOSG web provides a summary of OSG specific information for VO management.


---++Monitoring and Information Services
---+++Core MIS
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (CoreMIS) has been successfully deployed during the Integration testbed meeting and is now released as MIS-CI version 0.2.5. The current version can be obtained with: 

<verbatim> 
pacman –get iVDGL:MIS-CI
</verbatim>

---+++Grid Cat
GridCat provides a catalog of site attribute information and results of validation tests.

---+++Monalisa
MonALISA provides a repository of time-sampled information from various sources.

---+++BDII and GLUE
Discussions regarding OSG-specific uses of BDII and issues of GLUE schema are availble at GlueOSG.

---+++Discovery Service 
The discovery service provides a registry for publishing and querying grid services. It has similar functionality to a UDDI registry but provides a more lightweight API, xmlrpc accessibility and a much more dynamic and distributed architecture. Service publications can be performed at any instance of the discovery service and the publication will be automatically broadcast to all other instances of the discovery service. This allows clients to locate services from any discovery service instance, regardless of where the initial service publication took place. 

	* Service Readiness Plan for the JClarens-based discovery service is available here: [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]].
	* DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions specific to the OSG are in place.

---++Accounting
Accounting will be provided by MonaLisa and ACDC.

---++Storage Services
---+++Disk Resource Manager
The SRM DiskResourceManager product available in the VDT is used to provide a 
storage management interface to disk-based storage resources presented to the OSG.
