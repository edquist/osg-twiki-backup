---+!!<nop>Include for creating a "where used" of a BASETOPIC
This twiki is intended to be used as an include in all documents.  It will provide a 2 cross-references for the page it is included in:
<OL>
  <LI>The first showing all twiki topics that reference the BASETOPIC.
  <LI>Showing all links reference that the BASETOPIC
</OL>
In twiki world, the BASETOPIC is defined as "The name of the topic where a single or nested INCLUDE started - same as TOPIC if there is no INCLUDE".

The syntax for using this on a page is:
<pre>
   <nop>%INCLUDE{"WhuReferences"}<nop>%
</pre>
It should almost always be placed AFTER the  <nop>%STOPINCLUDE<nop>% in the topic.  This will allow it to be visible when the topic is accessed directly, but it will not appear when a topic is "INCLUDE"d in another topic.
