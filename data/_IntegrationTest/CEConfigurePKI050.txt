Minimally, you will need a host certificate and private key to identify of your CE.

---+++ Setup and maintenance of Certificate Authority connection
Configure the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA) to be used by default by running the utility below. 

If you are given the option "<b>choose the option which matches "1c3f2ca8 : ...</b>", <br>
then enter "<b>q</b>" at the prompts.
<pre>
  &gt; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/setup-cert-request
  Reading from /g3dev/globus/TRUSTED_CA
  Using hash: 1c3f2ca8
  Setting up grid-cert-request
  Running grid-security-config...
  ......
</pre>

A <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.10/certificate_authorities.html">list of CAs</a> were added as authorized CAs on your system. 

<b>Important Note:</b> In the past, you had the option of putting these certificates in the 
<i>/etc/grid-security/certificates</i> directory or in the local <i>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA</i> directory.
<b>This is no longer an option.</b>  
The OSG installation is pre-configured to place the certificates in 
the local <i>TRUSTED_CA</i> directory.  The <i>edg-crl-upgrade</i> daemon will be updating CRLs in this local directory only. 
 If you want to maintain certificates in the <i>/etc/grid-security/certificates</i> directory you should 
 link it to the local <i>TRUSTED_CA</i> location (symlink in either direction) and copy the CA files appropriately.

Please review the list of authorized CAs and modify the set in $X509_CERT_DIR= $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA as needed to match your local policy.  

From OSG 0.5.0/VDT-1.3.11 and greater the daemon <i>edg-crl-upgrade</i> has been
replaced with a root cron job called fetch-crl which runs daily from cron.  This will 
refresh the CRL's from these CA's.  Some of them expire in less than 1 day and you 
may find it necessary to increase the frequency of the fetch-crl to be more than daily.
The CRL's 

The [[Trash.Trash/Trash/IntegrationCertScripts050][Certificate Scripts Package Guide]] which has been installed can assist you with choosing Certificate Authorities to trust and periodically checking that the CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) have not expired.

---+++ Request and Install Host Certificate
After the pacman installation of the OSG CE software completes you should have the PPDG-Cert-Scripts  package installed (in $VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts) and the instructions below show the use of those scripts.

To authorize this resource for use, a host certificate needs to be obtained from an appropriate Certificate Authority. 
<UL>
<LI>Currently the  <a href="http://www.doegrids.org"> DOEGrids CA</a> is the most common CA in use for OSG participants. 
<LI>The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra][OSG Registration Authority]] with DOEGrids handles most certificate requests for OSG participants. 
</UL>
Here is a brief guide to the process assuming you have a valid User Certificate. 
 
Run the <i>cert-request</i> script  to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.
<pre>
   $ <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
   $ <b>source  ./setup.sh</b>
   $ <b>cd <i>some-work-dir</i></b>
   $ <b>cert-request -ou s -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>
Processing OU=Services request.
Give reason (1 line) you qualify for certificate, such as
  member of CMS experiment    or
  collaborating with Condor team,  etc.

You must agree to abide by the DOEGrids pollicies,
at
and you assert that you are authorized to request and install this
certificate on the specified host.
Do you agree (y,N): <b>y</b>

Your Certificate Request has been successfully submitted
Your Certificate Request id: <i>2394</i>

        You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate
        has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your
        certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</pre>
(Note--it is possible to go on and do most of the rest of the steps in the install 
guide while you are waiting for your host certificate to be approved.)

After the certificate is approved you will receive an email which includes the serial number of the new certificate.  
Use that serial number to retrieve the certificate and move it to the installation directory.
<pre>
  $ <b>cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0x2e7</i> -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>
Checking that the usercert and ./my-hostkey.pem match
writing RSA key
./usercert.pem and ./userkey.pem now contain your Globus credential


   $ <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
   $ <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
   $ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
   $ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
</pre>


The following command will verify the certificate is readable.  The output shown will be similar, but specific to your request.
<pre>
   $ <b>openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 743 (0x2e7)
        Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: DC=org, DC=DOEGrids, OU=Certificate Authorities, CN=DOEGrids CA 1
        Validity
            Not Before: Oct 17 22:03:24 2006 GMT
            Not After : Oct 17 22:03:24 2007 GMT
        Subject: DC=org, DC=doegrids, OU=Services, CN=my-host.some.domain
          .........
</pre>
    
---+++ Get an LDAP service certificate to run authenticated MDS (optional)
MDS is the monitoring and directory service. The GRIS (Grid Resource info service, a sensor that collects site data and publishes it to MDS) is 
configured by default to allow anonymous access only.  Only those sites which keep anonymous access available will be able to publish their information to the OSG BDII. 

Instructions are in the 
$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README on how to allow only authenticated and authorized access.  Authenticated access requires an LDAP service certificate (two files), owned by the MDS owner (if you installed as root, the owner is probably daemon -- check).
<pre>
   $ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
   $ <b>cert-request -ou s -dir . -host <i>my-host.some.domain</i> -service ldap -label <i>my-host-ldap</i></b>
</pre>
And follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating <b>ldapkey.pem</b> and <b>ldapcert.pem</b>. 

---+++ Get a personal grid certificate if you don't already have one (optional)
If you do not already have a personal grid certificate, which will be needed to run the tests, then you can request one in a similar manner to the host certificate described above.
You should be logged in to the user account where you will normally initiate grid actions, and the commands below will place your certificate
in the globus default location (~/.globus).  You should specify OSG for the RA affiliation and also for the Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo unless you already know the more appropriate
values to use.
<pre>
 $ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
 $ <b>cert-request -ou p</b>
</pre>
After you receive email notification that the certificate have been issued, then you can retrieve it with the following
command, and using the serial number shown in the email notice.
<pre>
 $ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
 $ <b>cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0xYYYY</i></b>
</pre>
