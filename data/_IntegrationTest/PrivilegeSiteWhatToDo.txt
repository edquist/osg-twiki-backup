---++Figure out what to do

The flowchart below will help you decide what kind of configuration you should setup.


Definitions:
	* Role based authorization: a user can get a different extended proxy from the VO VOMS server. This says, for example, that in a moment he is acting as a member of the analysis group, and the other is acting as a production coordinator. Role based authorization will allow you to map the user to a different account depending on the role.
	* Account pools: as implemented by GUMS, work as follow: GUMS will assign to each DN one account. The user will be mapped always to the same DN from then on. Accounts won't be created or recycled by GUMS. You can choose to have one or more pools (for example, a pool for VO, a pool for group in VO, a pool for role in a VO, a pool for groups accross VO, etc...)
	* Central management: it means being able to control all gatekeepers access from a single file, and not having to look/change configuration on each gatekeeper.

</verbatim>

---+++ Full privilege site configuration
In this configuration, you will have:
	* One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username.  A local account domain is similar to an YP domain.
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with the PRIMA module to connect to the GUMS server for each gatekeeper request.
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with gums-host to retrieve the accounting inverse map in a cron job
So you need to:
	* Install one GUMS at your site for the grid account domain (e.g. YP domain)
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Configure the PRIMA module on your gatekeeper(s)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ Compatibility site configuration
You do not _require_ the full privilege site configuration, but it's advisable. You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. Also, you will introduce delays since each gatekeeper will have to regenerate the map before implementing the new policy or allowing new users. You should fall back to this configuration if:
	* Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured through grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipolate that file directly, without passing through globus)
	* The idea of running GUMS 24/7 scares the hell out of you, and you'd rather approach with caution.
In this configuration, you will have:
	* One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with gums-host to retrieve both maps in a cron job
So you need to:
	* Install GUMS at your site
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ "Ye olde grid3" site configuration
You do not _require_ "full privilege" or "compatibility", but you still can use them if you want. You'll probably prefer this configuration if:
	* You are a small site (one gatekeeper)
In this configuration, you will have:
	* The EDG mkgridmap creating the grid-mapfile running as a cron job

---++Do it!


---+++ Full Privilege or Compatability Mode

The services are the same, just differences in the configurations.

---++++ GUMS service

  The GumsAdmins topic covers the installation and basic configuration of the GUMS service.

---++++ Configure the PRIMA module
PRIMA comes with your VDT installation, you will just need to change a couple of configuration files.

You can find documentation on how to activate the PRIMA Authorization module in VDT to query a GUMS Identity Mapping Service at: https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege: Title: "Activating the PRIMA Authorization Module in VDT 1.3.1". 

Also on this site is a document with the URLs of two test GUMS Servers that may be used for evaluation: Title: "GUMS Mapping Servers for ITB 0.1.0". 

---++++ Configure gums-host

The GUMS-Client is installed as part of the OSG ITB Core install from the VDT to the
$VDT_LOCATION/gums directory.

A site uses the following file, _gums-client.properties_ to connect to the GUMS service

<verbatim>
# cd $VDT_LOCATION/gums/etc
# cat ../etc/gums-client.properties
gums.location=https://localhost:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin
gums.authz=https://localhost:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</verbatim>

The _localhost_ in this example should be the name of the GUMS Service host.

The gums command in _$VDT_LOCATION/bin_ can be used to test the GUMS service connection.

<verbatim>
# ./gums
usage: gums command [command-options]
Commands:
  generateGrid3UserVoMap - Generate grid3-user-vo-map.txt for a given host.
  generateGridMapfile - Generate grid-mapfile for a given host.
  manualGroup-add - Includes a DN in a group.
  manualGroup-remove - Removes a DN from a group.
  manualMapping-add - Adds a DN-to-username in a mapping.
  manualMapping-remove - Removes a DN from a mapping.
  mapUser - Local credential used for a particular user.
  mapfileCache-refresh - Regerates mapfiles in the cache.
  updateGroups - Contact VO servers and retrieve user lists.
For help on any command:
  gums command --help
</verbatim>

Test the service by generating a mapfile at the command line

<verbatim>
# ./gums generateGridMapfile 
</verbatim>

Once tested setup the cron job to generate the maps at 6 hour intervals:
<verbatim>
# ln -s $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin/gums-host-cron /etc/cron.hourly/gums-host-cron
</verbatim>

For more information about the GUMS Client, look within at:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html
They are toward the end.

---+++ "Ye olde grid3 mode"

Install and configure EDG mkgridmap
It will come prepackaged and preconfigured with the OSG installation. You just need to check that the daemon "edg-gridmapfile-upgraded" is running.
To create a gridmapfile containing an entry for every member of the VO, first you need to move and start the edg-gridmapfile-upgraded daemon.
<verbatim>
# cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded /etc/init.d/

# /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded start
</verbatim>
