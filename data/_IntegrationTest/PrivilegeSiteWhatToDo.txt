---++Figure out what to do

The flowchart below will help you decide what kind of configuration you should setup.


Definitions:
	* Role based authorization: a user can get a different extended proxy from the VO VOMS server. This says, for example, that in a moment he is acting as a member of the analysis group, and the other is acting as a production coordinator. Role based authorization will allow you to map the user to a different account depending on the role.
	* Account pools: as implemented by GUMS, work as follow: GUMS will assign to each DN one account. The user will be mapped always to the same DN from then on. Accounts won't be created or recycled by GUMS. You can choose to have one or more pools (for example, a pool for VO, a pool for group in VO, a pool for role in a VO, a pool for groups accross VO, etc...)
	* Central management: it means being able to control all gatekeepers access from a single file, and not having to look/change configuration on each gatekeeper.

  -----------------------
</verbatim>

---+++ Full privilege site configuration
In this configuration, you will have:
	* One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username.  A local account domain is similar to an YP domain.
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with the PRIMA module to connect to the GUMS server for each gatekeeper request.
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with gums-host to retrieve the accounting inverse map in a cron job
So you need to:
	* Install one GUMS at your site for the grid account domain (e.g. YP domain)
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Configure the PRIMA module on your gatekeeper(s)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ Compatibility site configuration
You do not _require_ the full privilege site configuration, but it's advisable. You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. Also, you will introduce delays since each gatekeeper will have to regenerate the map before implementing the new policy or allowing new users. You should fall back to this configuration if:
	* Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured through grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipolate that file directly, without passing through globus)
	* The idea of running GUMS 24/7 scares the hell out of you, and you'd rather approach with caution.
In this configuration, you will have:
	* One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with gums-host to retrieve both maps in a cron job
So you need to:
	* Install GUMS at your site
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ "Ye olde grid3" site configuration
You do not _require_ "full privilege" or "compatibility", but you still can use them if you want. You'll probably prefer this configuration if:
	* You are a small site (one gatekeeper)
In this configuration, you will have:
	* The EDG mkgridmap creating the grid-mapfile running as a cron job

---++Do it!


---+++ Full Privilege or Compatability Mode

The services are the same, just differences in the configurations.

---++++ Install GUMS
First of all, make sure no old copy of gums is installed on the system you're using for the GUMS server ('ls $VDT_LOCATION/gums-service' should return fail to find the file).  You should install GUMS from VDT (VDT 1.3.4 or newer). The full GUMS service description and detailed manual is at the GUMS site:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS

<verbatim>
# pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache:GUMS
</verbatim>

This will install both the GUMS server and the GUMS client. To start/stop GUMS:
<verbatim>
# $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/tomcat-5 start|stop
# $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/apache start|stop
</verbatim>

You'll want to make it so it starts/shuts down with the server.  The VDT will do this for you if you answer "y" to the question "Would you like to enable the GUMS server to run automatically?".  If you answer "n", or do the install as non-root, you can set up the services with the following commands:
<verbatim>
# ln -s $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/tomcat-5 /etc/init.d/tomcat-5
# ln -s $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/apache /etc/init.d/apache
# chkconfig --list
# chkconfig --add tomcat-5
# chkconfig --add apache
# chkconfig tomcat-5 on
# chkconfig apache on
# chkconfig --list
</verbatim>

You can also install it manually, or learn more about the installation at:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html

---++++ Configure GUMS

	* Add yourself to the list of gum admins.  Log into your gums host (as root), cd to $VDT_LOCATION/gums-service/sbin and run './addAdmin "your CN"' to gain admin access to your gums web interface.  
		* Note: you must run addAdmin from the sbin directory.  The VDT hopes to fix this in a future release.
	* A template gums.config file is installed in $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v5/webapps/gums/WEB-INF/classes/gums.config.  It is very bare.  To get some instant gratification, place the following into the file:

<verbatim>
		<groupMapping name='osg' accountingVo='osg' accountingDesc='OSG'>
		  <userGroup className='gov.bnl.gums.VOMSGroup'
					 url='https://grid03.uits.indiana.edu:8443/edg-voms-admin/vos/services/VOMSAdmin'
					 persistenceFactory='mysql' name='osg' voGroup="/vos/osg"
					 sslCertfile='/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem'
					 sslKey='/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem' ignoreFQAN="true"/>
		 <accountMapping className='gov.bnl.gums.GroupAccountMapper' 
					 groupName='osg' />
	  </groupMapping>
</verbatim>

	* Now, go back to your gums web interface at https://your-gums-server:8443/gums, click on "Generate Grid Mapfile," enter the hostname of the gums server and click "Generate grid-mapfile."  You should get the text of a grid-mapfile formatted output.
	* Now, connect your gums server to your VOMS server.  First you need to allow others (i.e., your gums server) to list the contents of your VO.  Point your browser at your VOMS server (https://your-voms:8443/edg-voms-admin/your-vo/webui/Admin/global-acl/edit.  Click on "Operation -> List", then click "Add new entry."  This will allow all outside users to view your VO.  
	* Add an entry for your VOMS server to your gums.config like the one above, modified accordingly.  There are lots of options that can be added to the gums.config file.  For full details see the following documents:  
	* PRIMA 0.2 (from ItbRel015) can not interface to a GUMS server that runs with a service (vs host) certificate.  If you will be using PRIMA you need to switch the certificate used by gums:
<verbatim>
		# cd /etc/grid-security/http
		# mv httpkey.pem httpkey.pem.sav
		# mv httpcert.pem httpcert.pem.sav
		# cd ..
		# cp hostkey.pem http/httpkey.pem
		# cp hostcert.pem http/httpcert.pem
		# chown -R daemon:daemon http
</verbatim>
	
The gums configuration guide:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_configuration.html
and the gums.config reference:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_config_gums.html
to explore more options.

---++++ Configure the PRIMA module
PRIMA comes with your VDT installation, you will just need to change a couple of configuration files.

You can find documentation on how to activate the PRIMA Authorization module in VDT to query a GUMS Identity Mapping Service at: https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege: Title: "Activating the PRIMA Authorization Module in VDT 1.3.1". 

Also on this site is a document with the URLs of two test GUMS Servers that may be used for evaluation: Title: "GUMS Mapping Servers for ITB 0.1.0". 

---++++ Install and configure gums-host
You can install the GUMS client from VDT:

<verbatim>
# pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_134_cache/GUMS-Client
</verbatim>

To generate the maps at 6 hour intervals:
<verbatim>
# ln -s $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin/gums-host-cron /etc/cron.hourly/gums-host-cron
</verbatim>

For more information about the GUMS Client, look within at:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html
They are toward the end.

---+++ "Ye olde grid3 mode"

Install and configure EDG mkgridmap
It will come prepackaged and preconfigured with the OSG installation. You just need to check that the deamon "edg-gridmapfile-upgraded" is running.
