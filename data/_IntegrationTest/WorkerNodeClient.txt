---++ Introduction

This is a minimal set of executables that need to be made available to the worker nodes in a Compute Element.

It may be installed on a shared filesystem, or locally on each worker node (as long as the path on each worker node is the same).

You will be prompted for this path when running the =configure-osg.sh= script on the gatekeeper in order to set
the =$OSG_GRID= variable.

---++ Installation
Install with <Br>
=pacman -get OSG:osg-wn-client-0.4.0=
