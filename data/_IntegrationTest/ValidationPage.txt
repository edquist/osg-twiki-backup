---++Introduction

This page is the starting point for all validations for the integration testbed.

---++ Daily Validation
	* [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/Validation/][Daily Validation project]] from USCMS.

---++For !GridCat Validation
	* http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/. What to check besides red/green?

	* See the MonALISA twiki web for details.
	* http://madman.uits.indiana.edu:8888/
		 <br>then go to 'Site Status' and verify there are no red or orange boxes for your site and you are running version 1.4.4
		
---+++ Notes

I am having an inconsistent reporting of site information in MonALISA. Under the Statistics - VO Jobs View the report is listing the number of jobs I submitted correctly. That is when I submit 10 CMS jobs, with 4 running and 6 idle the report correctly displays that information. However under my site report http://madman.uits.indiana.edu:8888/display?page=i&farm=UCSanDiegoITB3.1&pTime=1+day the current running jobs and running job graphs are blank. Are these two reports getting their information from different locations? -- Main.TerrenceMartin - 30 Nov 2005

---++For ACDC Validation

	* How to check whether ACDC is collecting job metrics?
	* Start from http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/operations-dashboard.php?grids=6&vos=13
	* Select the Ad-hoc Grid (not the ITB)
	* Then email your DN to Mark Green (mlgreen@ccr.buffalo.edu)
	* Make sure the corresponding certificate is loaded in your browser.
	* Then press "Register the Resource"
	* Then the cron will automatically site verify their resource using the MIS VO
	* If there are problems then they click on the red or yellow box and look at the detail service status box for what is wrong. 
	* Operations matrix: http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/statistics/acdc/vo_support_matrix.php
