---++Introduction

This page is the starting point for all validations for the integration testbed.

---++ Current Validation Table

	* SiteValidationTableITB031

---++ Daily Validation
	* [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/Validation/][Daily Validation project]] from USCMS.

---++For !GridCat Validation
	* http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/. What to check besides red/green?

---++For !MonALISA Validation

	* See the MonALISA twiki web for details.
	* http://madman.uits.indiana.edu:8888/
		 <br>then go to 'Site Status' and verify there are no red or orange boxes for your site and you are running version 1.4.4
		
---+++ Notes

I am having an inconsistent reporting of site information in MonALISA. Under the Statistics - VO Jobs View the report is listing the number of jobs I submitted correctly. That is when I submit 10 CMS jobs, with 4 running and 6 idle the report correctly displays that information. However under my site report http://madman.uits.indiana.edu:8888/display?page=i&farm=UCSanDiegoITB3.1&pTime=1+day the current running jobs and running job graphs are blank. Are these two reports getting their information from different locations? -- Main.TerrenceMartin - 30 Nov 2005

---++For ACDC Validation

	* How to check whether ACDC is collecting job metrics?
	* Start from http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/operations-dashboard.php?grids=6&vos=13
	* Select the Ad-hoc Grid (not the ITB)
	* Then email your DN to Mark Green (mlgreen@ccr.buffalo.edu)
	* Make sure the corresponding certificate is loaded in your browser.
	* Then press "Register the Resource".
	* Click on the black box next to your resource on [[http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/operations-dashboard.php?grids=6&vos=13][the ACDC page]].  
	* Then the cron will automatically site verify their resource using the MIS VO.
	* Click on the "Pull resource data" button near the top of the screen (this will cause ACDC to submit a job to re-read your grid3-info.conf file).
	* Verify the values at http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/grid_vo_stats.php?showall&vo_id=13&grid_id=6
	* Click the "Re-test active resource" button to force an update of test data.
	* If there are problems then they click on the red or yellow box and look at the detail service status box for what is wrong. 
	* Operations matrix: http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/statistics/acdc/vo_support_matrix.php

---++VO Status
	* See VoAdmins page for the latest.  (This needs to be updated.)


---++Discovery Validation

The DRM server running at LBL has successfully reported its existence to the ITB discovery server at Caltech.  We were able to see the DRM service show up in the web browser interface of the Discovery Service.

Gabrielle Carcassi installed the jClarens-Publisher package at BNL and successfully used it to publish the STAR and ATLAS voms services to the Discovery Service:  http://ultralight.caltech.edu:8080/jclarens/web/rendezvous/rendezvous_interface.html

In addition, we successfully used the mkgridmapconf.sh script from jClarens-Publisher to generate a edg-mkgridmap.conf file from the above voms server registrations:

<verbatim>
$ bin/mkgridmapconf.sh
# Generating edg-mkgridmap.conf from 2 Discovery Service entries
# STAR VO admin star-vo@bnl.gov
group vomss://vo.racf.bnl.gov:8443/edg-voms-admin/star star
# ATLAS VO admin usatlas-vo@bnl.gov
group vomss://vo.racf.bnl.gov:8443/edg-voms-admin/atlas/usatlas usatlas1
</verbatim>
