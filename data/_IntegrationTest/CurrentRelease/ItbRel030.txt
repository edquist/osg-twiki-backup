	* Stay tuned to DiskResourceManager for updates.


---++ Site Verify
The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the pacman cache as of this release.


---++ CMS Tier1 SE
The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 interface, with additions for implicit 
space reservation.  CMSSrmdCache provides the readiness plan. The service will be available to all registered OSG VO's.
To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client.  This is available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available and should probably be the version deployed.)

[v1_15 has been announced by Timur on May 13. The recommended version may be the same, needs to be confirmed : Abhishek S R, 05/20/2005]

---++ SRM DRM (Testing)
A disk based storage resource manager from the LBL group.  Integration plan and associated activities are available at SrmDrm.
