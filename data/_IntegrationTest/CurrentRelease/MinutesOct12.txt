---++Introduction
Minutes of the Integration meeting, October 12, 2006
   * Last meeting: MinutesOct5
   * Previous meetings: MeetingMinutes
   * Coordinates: 2:30pm Central, 1-510-665-5437 #1212

---++ Attending
   * David Cafaro/GTU, Gabriele/FNAL, Burt Holzman, Doug Olson, David Meyers, Alain Roy
   * UIOWA Grow team, Horst Severini, Steven Timm, Shaowen Wang, John Weigand, Xin Zhao

---++ Agenda
   * VDT 1.4.0 released.
   * ITB  0.5.1 available for testing as of Friday October 6.
   * Roll Call of sites that have installed or are installing ITB 0.5.1:  
      BNL-ITB-Test1 (Xin), GP_FARM_Test and one other FNAL site per Steve Timm, 
      CMS-BURT-ITB (Burt), GROW-ITB (Shaowen), GTU delayed due to hardware acquistion (David C.), 
      ITB-INSTALL-TEST and ITB-INSTALL-TEST2 (John W.) ,
      LIGO-CIT-ITB (David M.), OUHEP_ITB (Horst)
   * Installation issue #1:
      Steve T. noted there is not yet a Twiki page for the O.5.1 installation. Only a 0.5.0 installation
      guide exists on the Twiki. What is the best practice? Create a new 0.5.1 guide from a renamed copy of
      the 0.5.0 guide or edit-in-place revisions and comments on the existing 0.5.0 guide? John W pointed  
      out that he has often created new documentation for a release by editing-in-place the last ITB 
      installation Twiki pages.  ACTION: As there is no content mangement system or version control 
      system on the Twiki, we have delegated the activity to propose a recommended practice for ITB 
      participants to a sub-committee of three:Rob Gardner (chair), Rob Quick and John Weigand and to 
      report at the next ITB meeting on the proposed recommended practice.
   * Installation issue #2:
      David M. noted that on installation of ITB 0.5.1, the Tomcat v5 container for Globus web services is 
      now installed and started by default. In prior releases the container explicitly needed to be configured
      by the site administrator. Alain Roy will determine if this is due to a change introduced in VDT 1.4.0.

---++ Any Other Business
   * Adding VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-Client to the Worker Node package has been requested to allow jobs to use the 
      voms-proxy-info command (agenda item submitted by Leigh). Steve T. noted that additional 
      certificate components will need to be distributed to the WNs to support the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-Client and wanted 
      to know the proposed distribution and update mechanisms for these components. ACTION: As Leigh 
      is on vacation, we will postpone discussion of this item to the next ITB meeting
      where Leigh can lead a discussion on the trade-offs on mechanisms for supporting the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-client on
      the WNs.
   * Call for beta-site participants for BDII/GIP client scripts under development. Shaowen and the GROW
      team have repackaged scripts that query BDII so that site administrators and developers can query
      the state of their BDII services directly. As these scripts are not mature enough for the VDT at 
      present, please email Shaowen directly if you want access to these tools.
   * Gabriele at FNAL has requested ITB sites configure the CeMON infrastructure component.  David M.   
      noted he will attempt to configure this component in the future.
