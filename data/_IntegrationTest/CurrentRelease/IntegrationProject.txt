---+++ Components
The VTB will have a flexible and distributed infrastructure for hosting services required for OSG required systems tests.  VTB sites (A, B, C and G=GOC-hosted) will provide infrastructure and effort to host system elements comprising the VTB.  A preliminary set of VTB components include: 

   * CE_n: compute elements
      * CE services may be distributed over one or more hosts.
      * WN_n: worker node testing
   * SE_n: storage elements, n >= 1
      * This may be multiple servers depending on the OSG SE under test.  For example, a 
   * ES_n: edge service elements
   * CI_n: client interface hosts (client testing, job submission host, workload generator) 
   * VTB GUMS service host
   * VTB VOMS service host
   * VTB information service host
   * VTB resource selector/discovery host
   * VTB monitoring service host
   * VTB accounting service host

Some of these services may be combined on hosts.  In addition, we envision a multi-site VTB infrastructure monitor and configuration database to emulate a single site facility.
   * VTB facility monitor - providing web-visible feedback and monitoring data of combined services.
   * VTB configuration database
   * VTB metrics data and reduced performance results archival

The project will be executed within the overall project execution plan (PEP) which will include task and priority assignment, regular effort reporting, schedule and milestone evaluation, and reviews.
