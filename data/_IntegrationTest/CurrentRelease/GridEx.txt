---++Introduction
The Grid Exerciser (GEx) is a grid diagnostic and monitoring tool.  The GEx is currently run by the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Condor Project]] at the University of Wisconsin on [[http://www.ivdgl.org/grid3/ Grid3]] and the OSG [[http://www.ivdgl.org/osg-int/ Integration Testbed]] (ITB).  Though the GEx can be run from any site against any grid.

The GEx has these goals:

	* By providing a continuous stream of jobs for all sites on a grid, the GEx provides a continuous diagnostic capability for identifying errors, primarily when jobs don't run at all, or jobs abort with errors.

	* Second, the GEx provides a continuous _backfill_ load upon all sites in the grid.

When sites are configured correctly, GEx jobs run at the lowest priority. and directly indicate the unused computing capacity for a site.  Ideally, the GEx should accumulate a low level of successful run time at a site.  A net run time of zero indicates a problem, either with the GEx or the site.  A high run time indicates the site is either lightly loaded, or a problem prioritizing GEx jobs.

---++Site Loading Algorithm
TBD: MIN(10 or # CPUs/site in GridCat), 

TODO: only sites with GridCat status==active

---++GEx User Identity
The GEx runs from the GRIDEX VO, gridex user, with the certificate subject
<verbatim>
/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Alan De Smet 489066
</verbatim>
but will soon migrate to the new certificate
<verbatim>
/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Jeff Weber (Grid Exerciser) 365339
</verbatim>

---++Configuring Site Policy for GEx Jobs
TBD: Condor, other batch systems

---++Most Recent OSG-ITB GEx Report
TBD.

---++Interpreting GEx Reports
TBD:

---++Links
TBD

---++Pending GEx Changes:
	* Update to use new certificate
	* Modify GEx to dynamically restart each TBD period, and read GridCat at the start of each run.  Currently, site list is queried by script from GridCat, GEx is (re)started by hand.
	* Add interpretation of new GridCat status bit: only submit jobs to "active" sites, but log "inactive", "unknown" sites.  Note that a latency occurs from when the site status is updated in the GridCat until the GEx responds to the new status.

	* Publish most recent OSG-ITB report online similar to latest [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~adesmet/ge/results.txt Grid3]] report.

	* Add verification of job stdout and stderr
