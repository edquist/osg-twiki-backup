   For Item number 1) VO registrations 

  The current OSG-ITB release has the following seven VOs.
  THese were settled upon at the OSG integration meeting.

    1) iVDGL 
    2) USCMS
    3) ATLAS
    4) GRACE
    5) GADU
    6) SDSS
    7) CDF

   For the new release *each* of these VO's and any additional ones
   need to submit a VO registration as described on the page:

</verbatim>

http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ItbVo

<verbatim>

   Using the VO registartion information I will be able to create and
   build the software which wil be distributed by the vo-0.1.4.pacman 
   package.

   As we discussed at last weeks meeeting, the voms service is now
   dependant upon the VDT 1.3.3 release.

   Thus the OSG ITB 0.1.4 VO infrastructure is waiting the 
   release of VDT 1.3.3 and the OSG 0.1.4 release is awaiting 
   the VO infrastructure information.  

   So in a timeline fashion:

    time 0)  VDT 1.3.3 is released
    time 1)  VOMS admins install, configure and, register thier VO's
    time 2)  I add each of the VO registration information to the 
               osg release via the vo-0.1.4.pacman package. 
    time 3)  OSG ITB 0.1.4 is released


  Item number 2 .  MIS-CI notification call out

   The current version of MIS-CI does not provide a notification
   to a service administrator when it is configured.  It was mentioned
   by Mark Green that this would be desirable. 

    Is there a MIS-CI version 0.2.6 which will include this?
