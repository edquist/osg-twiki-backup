---++Installing a srm client
   * Installation Location: Vanderbilt
   * Client Used: LBNL's srm client version (http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist/client/index.html)
   * Source Obtained: From Alex Sim's group at LBNL (directly contacting them)

      * Step 1.  Obtain the client tgz. Untar it.
      * Step 2.  Install java. The client used was tested with Java 1.4.2_07. It should works with any version of    Java 1.4.2_x. They seem to have a client version that does not have this limitation.
      * Step 3.  setenv JAVA_HOME <full path where your run time java is installed>
      * Step 4.  setenv SRM_HOME <full path to this directory>
      * Step 5.  Please obtain a user certificate from authorities like the DOEGrids. YOu can get your from the online request system at ivdgl.org. 
      * Step 6.  Globus needs to be installed. Globus toolkit is used for generating grid proxies which the client uses.
      * Step 7.  I used the vdt for installing globus (http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html)
      * Step 8.  Once globus is installed, use /Globus install dir/globus/bin/grid-proxy-init to generate a proxy. You would need the usercert.pem and the userkey.pem set before you run this command. Point to be noted is that your grid proxies are valid only for 12 hours and they need to be regenerated using Step 8 every time it expires.

At this point you are ready to use the srm-client:

---++Installing a srm server
   * Installation Location: Vanderbilt
   * Server Used: LBNL's srm server based on srm spec v2.1.2 modified for receiving external plugin libs
   * Source Obtained: From Alex Sim's group at LBNL (directly contacting them)

      * Step 1.  Obtain the server tgz. Untar it.
      * Step 2.  Again the server i used for this installation needed a java 1.4.2.x version. 
      * Step 3.  In order to administer a srm server the user needs to obtain a host certificate from the DOE Grid authjorities. The difference between a host cert and a user cert is that, a user cert can be used on any machine by using the grid-proxy-init to generate grid proxies. A host cert can only be used for the physical machine you are requesting a host cert for.For more information check the ivdgl website.
      * Step 4.  Once the host certs have been properly installed in the /etc/grid-security folder you are ready to start configuring the server.
      * Step 5.  In order to configure the server the ws.rc file (included in your /serverintaldir/server) needs to be modified. The ws.rc provides example entries and these will change depending on your local system conditions.
      * Step 5.  Once the ws.rc is set up the final step is to create a file in your /etc/grid-security folder. Name the file as grid-mapfile. IN the grid-mapfile you have to enter the user cert entries of sll the users that are allowed to use your server. A typical entry in a grid-mapfile looks like this:

      * "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Doe Smith 98187" johndoe

      * Step 6. At this point you are ready to run your sevrer. Form your /serverintaldir/server execute the runMe.sh or runMe.tcsh (depending on your shell) and the server should start.
