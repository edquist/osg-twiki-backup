	* Storage discussion (Neha)
	* Monalisa issue (John, Iosif)
	* Validation
	* Worker node environmnent in OSG 0.4
	* ITB 0.3.0 sites status update
	* Sign-off on next face-to-face meeting, November 30-Dec 1, Fermilab


---++ Storage Focus

Neha will lead a walk-through of storage documents :

	* http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Storage/WebHome
		* StorageElementAdmins information for Integration
		* SRMClientTools - srmcp client tools and such
	* LocalStorageRequirements  - notes from the "ad-hoc CE storage group"

It is important that all OSG site administrators and application
developers understand the changes these might imply for the next release of
OSG 0.4.  It is important to have read these before the meeting so we can provide 
meaninful feedback.


---++ Monalisa and Vojobs Issue (John, Iosif)


---++ Validation

	* ValidationPage, in particular USCMS Daily validation of the ITB, [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/Validation/][here]].  Burt and John have setup a page to validate the production releases. For the ITB it is under production.


---++ Workernode environment setup

	* Follow up on last week's discussion (Alain was to discuss with Stu)
	* Relevant for VDT 1.3.8 and therefore next ITB release


---++ ITB Installations as of last week (tbu: "to be udpated" during meeting)

	* Status of testbed installaions of ITB 0.3.0:
		* UC - [[http://pgl.uchicago.edu/twiki/bin/view/Tier2/DevITB][in progress]].  
		* IU - OSG 0.3.0-ws up, WS-GRAM working, MDS4 opened Bug [[http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3856][3856]]. Resource is in  GridCat with the shortname of [[http://osg-itb.grid.iu.edu/index.php?view=sitename&whichmap=us&numentries=100&sortval=services&id=16][IUPUI]]
		* TTU - not here
		* UB - not here
		* BNL - not here: from Xin via email: _Yes, I have done the pacman install part on gridtest01, our new ITB GK. There was a problem in VDT that couldn't handle the globus user account home dir if it's on NFS (root squash), Alain said that will be fixed in VDT 1.3.8. We got around it yesterday and now I am about to configure it, but get distracted to many other things today..._
		* FNAL - no success - 
			* Burt was having problems with grid exerciser.  need to confirm with another site.  Alain consulted.  
			* John is having trouble with the configure monalisa script (this comes from VDT).  Alain is aware of this - needs a pretty big update - will be targeted for 1.3.8.  This was re-written to fit into the VDT environment better.  John has a URL describing the problem.  Some of this is VDT specific, not easily integrated back into VDT.  Iosif is helping, hope to provide a new version by tomorrow. 
		* IOWA - Have installed ITB release, and still have to configure Condor.  Could submit fork jobs just fine (pre-webservices version).  Hope to fix by end week. 
		* PU - was able to sort out issues with ws-gram not finding pbs logs.  Problem was with how local installation organizes its logfiles. Fixed with a symlink. Allow a site to designate a filename rather than a directory location (this is for ws-gram)?  Alain doesn't think its configurable at the moment (confirms later that the piece of gram that reads logfiles).  Submitting simple jobs from another box with gt4 client tools. Note - these are available separately in the VDT (for those that want to test).  Question comes up as to whether GridCat can develop a status check of these WS gatekeepers?  Suggestion is to whether this could be presented into the Discovery service.  (Aside - can the interface to the discovery service documented some place? Michael says is really meant as proof of concept rather than a designed interface for users. Can this be captured on a readiness plan? 
		* Caltech - Suresh is starting to work on upgrading their Opteron cluster.  Probably delayed till after SC05.
		* Kent - ligo will install after SC05.  Also want to upgrade with FC4.  (John is installing on FC4).  Alain - thought FC4 was already supported.  (Note will be trying to run on 0.3.0 sites.) Have tried on FSU.  Let Kent know when a site is ready, will send a LIGO application.
		* Horst - will also install when Panda work cools down.

	* Other comments - many of the questions are now gone.  Possible issue with Condor and Monalisa configuration.
