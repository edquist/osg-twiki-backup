---++ Introduction

      A GridFTP based SE is simply a directory ($DATA) accessible via gridftp and srm interfaces.

      From OSG CE Install Guide: 
      "The data directory will be required to be shared from the head node (gatekeeper node) to each of the worker nodes. This will be the directory to which applications will write input and output data files for running jobs. This directory should be writable by all users. Users will be able to create sub-directories which are private, as provided by the filesystem. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per worker node."
