---++Introduction

This document describes how CE administrator can configure "CE storage" (LocalStorageRequirements) during the installation and after (if he needs to change hte layout of his CE). 

LocalStorageRequirements describes what the different CE storage are and LocalStorageRequirements#Minimum_requirements specifies the  minimum requirements for being OSG compliant. NB: It is NOT mandatory to provide all the CE storages.


---++Installation

How to answer the configure-osg script ...

---++Reconfiguration

If you feel confident, you can adjust and already installed OSG site by editing =osg-info.conf= this way...
(or rerun the configure-osg script ...)

---++Examples
These examples present also relationships between what's visible from the inside of the CE (from the jobs) and what is available from the outside (SE, !GridFTP) for staging operations.
Your conficuration may be different from any of these.

---+++Very very simple CE
Lets say I have one or two computers, I want to install OSG using a disk partition on one of them and bring up a compliant CE that users can use for tests. I want also a SE provided bi a GridFTP server on the same machine.
[add a picture]

<br>
For sake of brevity, let's say the partition is =/opt= (If you prefer each of =/opt/grid=, =/opt/app=, =/opt/data=, =/opt/wngrid= can be on a different partition. Anything inbetween is fine also); users are mapped to different unix accounts but all belong to the same =griduser= unix group. The space available in =/opt= has to be at least...
 
<br>
	* Create the subdirectories =/opt/grid=, =/opt/app=, =/opt/app/etc=, =/opt/data=, =/opt/wngrid=. 
	* Change ownership =:griduser=
	* Change permissions (group write+sticky on data, ...)
	* install the server (OSG) in =/opt/grid= and the user client (OSG-WN-Client) in =/opt/wngrid=
	* Configure variables (=GRID=/opt/wngrid=, =APP=/opt/app=, =DATA=/opt/data=, =WN_TMP=/opt/data=)
	* Point the gridftp server to =/opt/data= (gsifpt://myserver.domain/mydir/ -> =/opt/data=)

---+++Grid3 style CE
These CE have a mechanism to share directories, a GridFTP or SRM server visible from aourside (but not mandatory from the inside)

---+++LCG style CE

---+++SRM style CE

---++Contributed Examples
Here administratirs can add tips or links to descriptions of their installation. These may include specific references that may not apply to any other CE.
