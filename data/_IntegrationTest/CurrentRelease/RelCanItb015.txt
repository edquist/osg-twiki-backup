---++Introduction
A face-to-face meeting of OSG integrators, VDT, a few hardy site administrators, and a documentarian for final integration of the OSG "release candidate" for mid-May deployment.  The focus of the meeting will be on functionality all services in the release candidate.  Note - this will likely be something like ITB 0.1.5, which we will define based on this week's experiences and developments.

   * *FOLLOW-ON SCHEDULE* Week of April 18 we will release the ITB 0.1.5 and begin deployment on all ITB sites, perform validations for services and applications.  See RelCanItb015Val.
