%STARTINCLUDE%

---++Description
<p>
The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_JOBS module of MonALISA collects metrics on the following:
 <OL>
   <LI><a HREF="#job_manager_queue_status_metrics">Job Manager Queue Status Metrics</a>

        These show the status of user grid jobs in the job manager queue 
        of the gatekeeper.
<pre>
  Total Jobs
  Idle Jobs
  Running Jobs
  Held Jobs
</pre>
      
   <LI> <a HREF="#job_submissions_metrics">GLOBUS Gatekeeper Job Submission Metrics</a>

     These show the status of job submissions through the Globus gatekeeper process.
<pre>
  Total Submissions
  Failed Submissions
  PingOnly Submissions
  Failed Jobs
  Job Success Efficiency
</pre>
</OL>

Each consists of a set of metrics depending on the data available in the
systems/files used as the source of information.   The metrics are collected using the UNIX account authorized by the gatekeeper (using  either the grid-mapfile or the Prima/GUMS authorization services).
The grid users are then mapped to a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo User  using  the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-User map table and the metrics reported on that basis.

Additional documentation on the !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_Modules metrics  not described on this page can be found:

---++User-VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo map file

The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_JOBS module maps the UNIX user accounts that jobs are assigned 
to the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo they belong to.  In the pre-PRIMA world where group accounts are used
exclusively the map file would look something like this.
<p>
File: $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt
<pre>
  #User-VO map 
  # #comment line, format of each regular line line: account VO
  # Next 2 lines with VO names, same order, all lowercase, with case (lines starting with #voi, #VOc)
  #voi btev ivdgl ligo sdss usatlas uscms gridex gadu grase
  #VOc BTeV iVDgL LIGO SDSS ATLAS CMS GRIDEX GADU GRASE
  btev btev
  ivdgl ivdgl
  lsc01 ligo
  sdss sdss
  usatlas1 usatlas
  uscms01 uscms
  uscms02 gridex
  gadu   gadu
  grase  grase
</pre>

The <b>#voi</b> line contains the lower case name of the VO.<br/>
The <b>#VOc</b> line contains the mixed case name of the VO. 
This is the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name that is actually reported to MonALISA. 
The order is critical to the correct mapping and is positional.  

The <b>remaining lines</b> map the Unix account (e.g., uscms01) to the lower case VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name (uscms).

The validation performed on this file was quite extensive in Grid3 and the VoModules (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_JOB and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoIO) will fail if every user cannot be mapped to a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and vice versa.
This validation has been relaxed somewhat for OSG and a WARNING will be issued if not all users can be mapped to a reportable (mixed case) VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name.


---++MonALISA setup
<p>
To setup up the collection of these metics in !MonALISA requires the following
configurations:
<ol>
 <li><b>VDTFarm.conf file</b><p> 
    The following entry in your VDTFarm.conf file will invoke the 
    monVoJobs module in the <b>FarmMonitor.jar</b> file every 300 seconds. 
    Both sets of metrics are generated from this module.
    <verbatim>
  *VO_JOBS {monVoJobs,localhost}%300
    </verbatim>
    In addition, the code for this module (monVoJobs) can be found in the
    $MonaLisa_HOME/Service/usr_code/VoModules-{version} directory.
  
 <li><b>$MonaLisa_HOME/Service/CMD/site_env file</b>     <p>
    The <b>site_env</b> is intended to support any local variables, setups or
    preprocessing requirements needed by any (not just the <b>monVoJobs</b>) 
    module specific to this implementation of MonALISA.  On startup, 
    MonALISA will first source the ml_env file and then the <b>site_env</b> 
    file, if it exists.
    <p>
For the <b>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_JOBS</b> module, the <b>site_env</b> file requires the
following:
<p>
<ol type=a>
<li>GLOBUS_LOCATION<p> 
- VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_JOBS needs this data to find the globus gatekeeper log file
for the job submissions metrics.<p>
- VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_IO needs this to identify the location of the gridftp log
<p>
<li> The next variable serves 2 purposes: identifying the job queue 
manager(s) and their respective location:<p>
<pre>
   PBS_LOCATION
   CONDOR_LOCATION
   LSF_LOCATION
   FBS_LOCATION
   SGE_LOCATION
</pre>
More than one job queue manager  can be in effect, but usually just one is.<p>
For some job queue managers additional environmental variablesare required:
<ul><li>CONDOR: requires CONDOR_CONFIG set 
<li>SGE: requires SGE_ROOT set 
</ul><p>
This can be accomplished by exporting this variable in the 
<b><i>site_env</i></b> script or by sourcing the VDT_LOCATION 
setup script in <b><i>site_env</b></i>. 
</ol>
<p>
</ol>
<p>

<a name="job_manager_queue_status_metrics"></a>
---++Job Manager Queue Status Metrics
<p>
The job manager queue metrics cover 4 statuses:
<ol>
<li>Total Jobs
<li>Idle Jobs
<li>Running Jobs
<li>Held Jobs
</ol>
Total Jobs is the sum of the Idle, Running and Held Jobs.
<p>
There are 5 Job Queue Managers supported and the table 
shows the mapping of their respective job status modules and the command used 
to query the job manager.  The individual grid users are mapped to VO 
 using the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-User map table.

---++GLOBUS Gatekeeper Job Submission Metrics

Submissions that have passed authentification and for which a 
job has been submitted to the local job queue manager:
condor, pbs, lsf, pbs and fork.
<p>
Those jobs have been assigned a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo user account are included in
the metrics.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>Failed Submissions</td>
<td>
Submissions that never make it to the local job manager.
<p>
In general, these submissions have failed authentification.
Since these submissions failed authentification they have not likely
been asssigned a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo user account and will not show in the metrics.
<p>
There may be some instances where they fail for other than
authentification and will appear, but I have not seen one yet.
</td>

<tr><td valign=top>PingOnly Submissions</td>

So far it is a mystery  to me as to what these are.  They never
result in a job submission to the local job manager and always
result in a failure message, but do not appear to really be faulures.
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td valign=top>Failed Jobs</td>
<td>
Job submissions that have been handed to the local job manager and 
have processed in the local cluster.  These jobs have failed at
some point in there processing.  
<p>

The Gram log files in the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo user account home directory identifies 
the error.

The examples below  illustrate problems problems with parsing the gatekeeper log file prior to the OSG-ITB version of Globus, i.e., the Grid3 version.  The pre-osg gatekeeper log never identified the thread  or job the messages belonged to.  So, on a heavily loaded system, the messages from various job submittals would be interspersed in the log file.  The examples shown below show this condition.  It made it impossible to, then , to associate the user assigned or error with a given job.  In these cases, the metric was dropped and, hence, job submittals understated.

Recently, we noticed that a PID is now assigned and logged for each job submittal.  This will solve the above mentioned problem.  The changes have not  been made for this as yet.
