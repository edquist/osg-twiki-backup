---++Introduction

An Information Service allows to publish informations about a resource and therefore to make the resource usable.
The Information Service can be characterized by the data that is publishing (set of attributes), the way  this data is organized (information schema), the system used to gather the information (information provider) and the system used to make the information available (information publisher or server).
In order to use a resource I have to be able to access all the information that I need, using a known schema (to know where to look for it) and a know server (I have to have a client for it).
An LCG resource broker, in order to submit jobs to a CE, need to access its information, organized according the [GLUE] schema and published through a [BDII]
A Grid3 submit client requires the information in the Grid3 schema and published through GridCat or Globus MDS.
The discussion about information system and information schema is important for several reasons including defining a way to describe resources within OSG and interoperate with other grids.
Therefore, it suggested immediate actions for the OSG deployment activity,  and directions for the (broader) GLUE schema discussion and development community.  

---++GLUE

The GLUE (Grid Laboratory Uniform Environment) information model is an information schema initially developed in 2002 to forster interoperation between Grids. 
More information about the GLUE project can be found  [[http://www.cnaf.infn.it/~sergio/datatag/glue/][here]] and [[http://infnforge.cnaf.infn.it/projects/glueinfomodel/][here]].  

GLUE Meeting at RAL
To work on the problems of the current schema and to provide a new version, there will be a meeting on February 24 at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) with representatives from the OSG, EGEE, LCG, Nordugrid, Globus and the R-GMA team (an EGEE project).  The current GLUE schema has an inadequate representation of the Storage Element (SE) and almost no VO related information.  Nordugrid has voiced criticisms for the schema previously.	Part of our discussions during the workshop was to identify a logical path forward for working with our European colleagues on the schema issues, to the extent that time is not wasted and that progress for interoperability can be made.
Since we currently have limited use of the current GLUE schema in OSG, to accommodate the requirements of other HEP related grids should not imply big development  efforts for OSG.  Approving a new GLUE version which solves at least the issues listed in the LCG minor upgrade proposal is a top priority for OSG, to be completed in the short time.  In general, we feel that a strategy of working iteratively with the LCG team and others interested in moving forward is the best approach.
To summarize, OSG is committed to working with LCG to evolve the GLUE schema so that interoperation between grids is possible, including for example: resource characterization, job submission, and data exchange.	We hope this direction works favorably for each of the GLUE stake-holding groups. 

---++BDII
“BDII” (Berkeley Database Information Index) is an LCG implementation of Globus GIIS-like information index based on the Berkeley Database.  For USATLAS and USCMS, it can be used as a mechanism to make US LCG resources (CE’s now, later SE’s) within OSG visible to the LCG grid.  Due to its importance for two large stakeholders of the OSG, the Deployment Activity recommended that its integration be considered within the ITB.  Note that not all OSG sites in the ITB or in the Spring-deployed OSG 0.2 may be required to publish to LCG servers.  Interoperability tests for job submission from an LCG resource broker using this scheme have already been exercised by US CMS and by iVDGL.
Related to BDII or the LDAP-based Globus 2 based information service is which information schema to publish, and which information providers to use to fill the required fields.  There is a long-running discussion and number of participants in the aforementioned GLUE activity.  In addition, Grid3 and the principal GLUE schema developer have met to discuss extensions that accommodate the Grid3 extensions; UML diagrams were made but no progress was made on implementing the extensions and moving it forward.	Finally, the LCG team has recently circulated a document (cite) outlining modest changes to the GLUE schema.

---++Actions
---+++OSG-ITB (now)
Within the OSG-ITB and in the following OSG deployment, the GIP (generic information provider) for GLUE will be installed as a separate Pacman package (provided by Leigh) that will replace the GLUE IP (information  provider) which is included VDT.  (A future version of the VDT itself will include the GIP.)  A Globus MDS authenticated GRIS service will be started at OSG sites,  and Lawrence Fields (CERN/LCG) will query it from a BDII (initially the service may be started unauthenticated on a voluntary basis to allow testing).	A site administrator would send email to Fields to announce the availability of its GRIS, and have the site added to an LCG BDII.

We identified actions to test information service (IS) infrastructure:
	* Perform a local test of the information provider.
	* Perform a local GRIS query.
	* Perform a query from our OSG-ITB BDII server (Leigh) 
	* Need to check that an LCG BDII server can query the GRIS, if applicable.
