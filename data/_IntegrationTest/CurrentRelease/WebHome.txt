---++Introduction

---+++!! Trash/Integration Objectives and Scope
This OSG Consortium Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, establishes a framework for releases, and coordinates the OSG Trash/Integration Testbed (ITB).

---+++!! OSG Trash/Integration Project
The OSG Trash/IntegrationProject delivers the core ValidationTestbed (VTB) for first pass systems-level integration and validation of VDT services and tools.

---+++!! Call for Contributions
The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG integration activities. It is a resource available to, and editable by, all OSG users (if you're new, register at TWiki.TWikiRegistration; Main.KyleGross or Main.RobQ will then have to add you to the
[[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GridGroup][GridGroup]] to allow write access. To edit content, click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of any page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').
_Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!_

---++OSG Services

   * The OSGServiceOverview provides an overview and context for the current major service components comprising the OSG integration testbed.
   * OsgMisOverview provides an overview of the monitoring and information services framework and landscape for OSG.

   * NewOSGServices describes the process for integrating new services into the OSG


---++ITB Releases
Here we describe the integration testbed releases and point to installation instructions.  An ITB release is defined as a set of functionalities that are provided by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), a _VO_ (Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo specific services provided by that VO, such as a Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB.  Client packages and libraries for use with an ITB release are provided by VDT releases - either the VDT Client distribution or sub-sets as needed by the client application or user.

---++Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Administrators

Information for VoAdmins including installation instructions, registration, and guidelines for participating in the OSG.

---++GUMS Administrators

Site administrators may be responsible for providing and maintaining a Grid User Management Service (GUMS) for clusters at their site.  Information including the definition of the service, installation instructions and setting up GUMS to support account mapping are available at GumsAdmins. The GUMS service is also necessary for setting up the role-based access control  mechanisms with PRIMA, etc.


---++Compute Element Administrators
CE Installation instructions are maintained in OSGCEInstallGuide. The SiteAdmins page includes information for CE site admins including:
   * Site registration procedures, and guidelines to for participation in the OSG Trash/Integration Testbed.
   * Installation instructions for the basic compute element
   * Installation instructions for additional site administration services, such as Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo management using GUMS.


---++Storage Element Administrators

Information for Storage Element (SE) Administrators includes 
   * How to setup SE based on SRM/dCache, SRM/DRM and Gridftp-based Filesystem. 
   * Instructions for ITB Testers to test a SE Implementation.
   * Other useful links related to Storage. 
      * Trash.Trash/IntegrationDCacheUsageTips

It is a work in progress and most updated information is available at Trash.Trash/IntegrationStorageElementAdmins. 

---++Visible Testbed and Validation
The OSG ITB undergoes a number of validation tests, provided by applications groups and service providers.

   * The Trash/IntegrationTestbed provides a view of the current integration testbed Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and site participants.
   * The ValidationPage (and previously ValidationPageRel01) is where validation procedures, tools, and results are collected.
