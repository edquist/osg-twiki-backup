---+!!<nop>OSG ITB CE Install Guide

%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%

This document is intended for administrators responsible for installing and configuring an OSG Compute Element (CE). 
It is not meant as an all-inclusive guide to Grid computing or even all the options for configuring a CE. It provides a recipe for a default configuration of the OSG provided reference implementation. It makes recommendations that have been found to be sensible starting points by OSG participants and may exceed the minimum requirements. Parties who wish to adapt to some local requirements/configuration should expect to have to adapt these instructions to their use.
Those interested in the formal requirements of a Compute Element are referred to the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=28OSG Deployment Document]].


This document is intended for administrators responsible for installing and configuring an OSG Compute Element (CE) into the OSG Integration !TestBed (ITB). It is not meant as an all-inclusive guide to Grid computing or even all the options for configuring a CE. Instructions for installing a CE intended for the OSG Production grid can be found [[Documentation.OsgCEInstallGuide][here]].

---+++ Operating Systems

The instructions assume you're using one of the following Linux distributions:

	* Red Hat 7.x
	* Red Hat 9.0
	* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
	* Fedora Core 3 
	* Debian Linux 3.1 (Sarge)

Installation may be successful with other Linux distributions, but they have not been tested by the maintainers of Pacman and the VDT.  Several "binary-compatible"
distributions such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.x (x=3,4) and Rocks 3.x (x>=1)
have been successfully installed by members of the OSG-ITB treating them 
as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 but no support is implied.

---+++Installation Method
The installation and configuration method is based on <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/">Pacman</a>.  Pacman is a package manager like RPM or dpkg, but is able to work on and support multiple platforms.  Specific Pacman directions are given below, and in the pre-installation procedures.

---+++ Conventions used
The following conventions are used in these pages:
	* =monospaced text= indicates terminal output 
	* ==bold monospaced text== indicates terminal input (by the user)
	* =<i>monospaced text in italics</i>= indicates variable data that may differ on your installation
	* the =&gt;= prompt indicates commands that do not require a specific shell or root access
	* the =#= prompt indicates commands that require root access
	* the =$= prompt indicates sh- or bash-specific commands
	* the =%= prompt indicates csh- or tcsh-specific commands

---++ Pre-installation Checklist
---+++ System or Cluster Already Setup (including batch system)?
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should be likewise previously installed and configured, unless you intend to use the Condor system that can optionally be installed with VDT.

The installation will ask for local storage space for 3 separate purposes: OSG applications, data, and temporary caching. It is recommended that you have separate, dedicated partitions for each purpose. For details on this storage use and configuration, please reference the section on "Configuring the Grid3 Information Provider" (URL).

---+++ Preserving a pre-existing Condor installation?
(Does this pertain to an external-to-VDT Condor installation?) If you would like to preserve your existing Condor configuration, you can set two environment variables so Pacman will recognize this. 

	* *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION* - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. _/opt/condor_). The Condor _bin/_, _bin_, _etc/_, _lib/_... directories should be directly under this location.
	* *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG* (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is _$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config_.

This will result in:
	* Condor being installed but not configured. 
	* VDT middleware services pointing to appropriate locations in your external Condor installation.
==# export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT==
For example, if you wish to preserve a Condor installed in the standard location,

==$ export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT==

(DDS What does that mean ? Upgrade of what ? I thought VDT didn't do upgrades ?)

It is NOT necessary to execute the setup.sh from any previously existing VDT installation in order to do an upgrade.  
%RED%(DDS What does that mean ? Upgrade of what ? I thought VDT didn't do upgrades ?)%ENDCOLOR%
It is possible, though certainly not recommended, to ManuallyChangeCondorPath after the OSG installation is finished.  This might be necessary if you have to reinstall your batch scheduler into a different location.

---++++ Firewall?
It is assumed that your hardware has a working network connection through which packages may be retrieved and from which services may contact your system. The full OSG CE packages is ~700MB so you don't want to be a the far end of a modem !

---++++ Time synchronization (NTP) 
If your installation is inside a site firewall or has a host firewall setup (look at host.allow/deny), you'll need to review the [[OSGCEInstallGuide#Firewalls][Firewall section]] of this guide and arrange for appropriate Internet access.

---++++ Reverse name lookups (DNS)
Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of eg. proxy lifetimes. 

---++++!! Reverse name lookups (DNS)
---+++ You'll need a unique OSG site name
Each OSG site %RED%(where site is equivalent to CE?)%ENDCOLOR% will need to designate a *unique name* by which services and resources may refer to the site. This name will be displayed on the Site Catalog and used in tables for other monitoring and accounting.  For example, the site at University of New Mexico has a unique name of UNM_HPC; the site at University of Buffalo is Buffalo_CCR.
#UniqueName 
---+++ You'll need a unique OSG resource name
Each OSG resource needs a *unique name* by which services and resources may refer to the resource. This name will be displayed on the Site Catalog and used in tables for other monitoring and accounting.  For example, the site at University of New Mexico has a unique name of UNM_HPC; the site at University of Buffalo is Buffalo_CCR.

If there is a _previous installation_ of the OSG or Grid3 environment or other Globus middleware, please _stop the processes_ which are currently running. This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), MonALISA and other services configured to start upon initialization on your system. Also, if you've sourced the $VDT_LOCATION/setup.[c]sh on your previous VDT install, just log out and log back in to clear out your environment.
---+++ Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs

More information is provided in [[OSG Shutdown Guide]].
---+++ Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs for OSG ITB
UNIX user accounts need to be created by the system administrator for the VOs.  
You will need to create at least one local user account (with the appropriate configuration) for each VO to which you wish to provide resources.  The uid and name of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later in the installation, but there are assumed defaults detailed in OsgVoAccounts. Those defaults are assumed for examples used in this installation guide.

The accounts are: 
	* cdf
	* grase
	* fmri
	* gadu
	* mis
	* uscms01
	* uscms02
	* usatlas1
	* usatlas2
	* usatlas3
	* sdss
	* lsc01
	* ivdgl
	* star
	* osg

</b></pre>

Note - as a rule, one should never install two separate pacman-obtained packages (two invocations of <tt>%pacman -get cache:<i>package</i></tt>) in the same directory.

---+++Installing the OSG CE software package

The installation described here is done as root.  However, non-root installs are supported. (%RED% There should probably be some caveat or supplemental reference here otherwise why have the "as root" default ? It IS dangerous if unnecessary. %ENDCOLOR%) Not all services will run as root; Condor, 
MonALISA and the GRIS will run as the user "daemon". If you prefer to run MonALISA and/or Condor with its own UID, you need only to create a 
<b>monalisa</b> and/or <b>condor</b> user before proceeding with the installation. The VDT will configure the daemons appropriately.  _Verify that the umask is set to "0022" prior to installation.  Failure to do so may render the installation unusable._

Grid3 developed a set of conventions about information to provide for a Computing Element. OSG is continuing to use those conventions to provide backward compatibility and as an interrim solution until consensus on a more dynamic information system is achieved. The Grid3 Information Provider collects that information and makes it available, via a standard config file ($VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-info.conf), to other applications/services.
There is a configuration script (<b>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.sh</b>) which automates much of the configuration.

pages. New resource admins may want read that information carefully and determine how to map those elements onto their Resource before proceeding. Guidance on the basic elements and common defaults is provided below.

---++++!!Gather configuration information

OSG strives to make the minimum requirements on a resource, however, to provide a basic execution environment that applications can build upon, certain information about file/filesystem locations is needed. Filesystem sharing and filesystem mount points available for a cluster requires specific coordination for applications to be installed and to be executed correctly. To this purpose, four special directory hierarchies (mount points) will be required to be defined and allocated in the OSG environment. These directories may be required to be available on the head node or gatekeeper node and also available, using the exact path, on each of the worker nodes or simply shared filespace.

* %RED%Grid Directory%ENDCOLOR%

	 This directory is where the Grid environment will be installed. This directory will contain the Globus middleware and other middleware applications. It should be writable for the user root. This directory contains both server and client utilities for the middleware and therefore should be shared between gatekeeper and worker nodes.

* %RED%Temporary Directories%ENDCOLOR%

	 There will be two temporary directories one will be local to the worker node and the other shared. The shared temporary directory will be the current working directory of a running application and persist only as long as the job is executing. The files in this directory should be managed by the running application Automated clean up may be required to be handled by the site administrator. All users should 
be able to use this directory for writing and reading files. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per worker node. The local temporary directory may be used by applications to reduce latency to data. At least 10G should be available in this directory. 

* %RED%Data Directory%ENDCOLOR%

	 The data directory will be required to be shared from the head node (gatekeeper node) to each of the worker nodes. This will be the directory to which applications will write input and output data files for running jobs. This directory should be writable by all users. Users will be able to create sub-directories which are private, as provided by the filesystem. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per worker node. One VO would like 100G+ per worker node. 

* %RED%Application Directory%ENDCOLOR%

	 If required or desired this will be the location of Grid3 the application software. Only users in the application VO will have write privileges to these directories. At least 10G byte of space should be allocated per application.

This configure script creates the $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-info.conf file. 
This file is the standard resource information file used by several monitoring services and applications to obtain basic resource configuration information. This file is *required* to be readable from that location for OSG CE's.
The resource owner may choose which information services to run to advertise this information. Configuration of several of the more popular ones is described below in the Monitoring section.

---+++Job Policy and the Batch Queuing System 
The configuration of a production queue manager is beyond the scope of this document. Since there will be periodic validation submitted by DNs in the "mis" VO, it is recommended sites provide at least two levels of priority and assign the lowest priority to user mapped to the "mis" VO.

The commands
<pre># <b>CONDOR_CONFIG="$VDT_LOCATION/condor/etc/condor_config"</b>
# <b>export CONDOR_CONFIG</b>
# <b>$VDT_LOCATION/condor/sbin/condor_master</b></pre>
will start the default personal-condor batch installation with 
default queuing, if you chose the default condor installation earlier.

There is a file $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/condor which can be copied
to /etc/rc.d/init.d for auto startup of personal condor if you wish.
Also note that the CONDOR_CONFIG variable is usually set correctly 
---++++Test Configuration (using local grid mapfile)

---+++ Authorizing Users
---++++!!Test Configuration (using local grid mapfile)

The first step is to configure the CE to allow access using your own Grid credentials. Once that's done you'll be able to run local tests and verify operation of your CE locally.

Make sure you have a Grid proxy for yourself.

---+++Configure MonALISA
%RED%This section is redundant: go to MonALISA for configuration instructions. AH
%ENDCOLOR%

The setup of MonALISA is done with the assistance of the
configuration script. However there are two files which need to be edited.
The <b>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/site_env</b> script must be modified 
manually to set the location of the batch queue.  In addition, the 
<b>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/VDTFarm/vdtFarm.conf</b> file must be updated
for the new <b>TracePath</b> module.  Instructions on how to edit these two 
files are below, following the configuration script.
  
	* Run the configuration script <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.5/configure_monalisa.html">$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_monalisa.sh</a> to set up MonALISA.
<i>For the ITB machines, the name <b>OSG-ITB</b> group should be used when queried for the "monitor group name."</i>
<br>
<pre>&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_monalisa.sh</b>

Your Monitor Group name is important to group your site correctly
in the global site list. OSG ITB users should enter "OSG-ITB".

Please enter your monitor group name [<i>hostname.domain.tld</i>]: <b>OSG-ITB</b>
...

...</pre>

Fill in your site specific information. *NOTE: Check your latitude and longitude entries!  
If you are in the Americas, for example, your longitude will be a negative number.	
Typical continental U.S. latitudes range from 25 to 55 degrees and longitudes range from 
-60 to -120 degrees.  If you get it wrong, your site will not show up properly in MonALISA.*

<pre>
Please review the information:

</pre>
	 
	* Edit the *site_env* file
			To have MonALISA interact with the local batch queuing system, 
			the file <b>site_env</b> will need to specify the location of the local 
			installation directories. 
<pre>&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD</b>
&gt; <b>vi site_env</b></pre>

 <pre><b>PBS_LOCATION="/usr/local/pbs";

	  &gt; <b>vi vdtFarm.conf</b></pre>

	  To have MonALISA use the *Tracepath* module the vdtFarm.conf
	  will need to be edited with the following line added:
	* Tracepath module lets you trace network activity near your cluster.  Why isn't it automatically installed?
 ==*Tracepath{monTracepath, localhost, " "}==

---++++ Testing MonALISA and its Information Providers
	  <tt># <b>/etc/init.d/MLD start</b></tt> 

---++++!!Testing MonALISA and its Information Providers

From a web browser, launch the MonALISA client tool (available at <a href="http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html">http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html</a>).
The client is launched from the "Start MonALISA Client" button on the
top of the left hand menu.  If it does not start automatically, you can save <b>MonaLisa_grid3.jnlp</b> to disk and execute
<pre>
<b>&gt; $JAVA_HOME/jre/javaws/javaws <nop>MonaLisa_grid3.jnlp</b>
</pre>
On the running MonALISA (ML) client, check
that your site is reporting to ML and that it has the correct geographical
location. Mouse over the dot and it will display the site name. Make
sure it is the name you picked out and that it conforms to the naming
convention (%RED% Where is this convention explained ? %ENDCOLOR%). 

To check that the various information providers are
reporting to ML, go to the !TabPan view (on the left hand menu bar) and
check that all of the table entries for your site are providing
information. If there are "Unknown" entries
in the fields, then most likely there is error in the ML configuration
files you modified.&nbsp; Please go through the instructions and
contact your local [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ops/][Support Center]] if you need help. 

---+++ Configure MDS (GRIS)

The Globus information system is called MDS and is preconfigured to read the grid3-info.conf information file. 

To test the GRIS, first you need an <a href="#Get_an_LDAP_service_certificate">LDAP service certificate</a> which needs to be owned by the user daemon.
<pre>
# <b>chown -R daemon /etc/grid-security/ldap</b>
</pre>

One may (optionally) start the Globus information service daemon (GRIS) with the following command (as root):

<pre>
# <b>/etc/init.d/gris start</b>
</pre> 

Then use your user account and proxy generated by <b>grid-proxy-init</b> to test the GRIS by running

<pre>
# <b>grid-info-search -h your.fully.qualified.hostname</b>
</pre>

If MDS is configured anonymously (in vdt 1.3.6, default is anonymous bind), simply query by issuing :
<pre>
# <b>grid-info-search -x -h your.fully.qualified.hostname -p port_number </b>
</pre>

---+++Setting Site State To Active
Since the default site state is presumed to be inactive, the CS site admin has to proactively switch the site state to be active. The switching can be done by modifying the file
<pre>
$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info
</pre>
to be 1 (see below).
If the value of grid_site_state_bit is 1, the site commences its active state, i.e.,
the content of $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info will look like:

If the value of <tt>grid_site_state_bit</tt> is 1, the site commences its active state, i.e.,
the content of <tt>$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info</tt> will look like:
</pre>
If the site decides to become inactive for various reasons, e.g., site maintenance, the site admin can set the value of grid_site_state_bit to be other than 1.

---++ Additional Client Software

The VDT-Client package contains some additional Grid client tools (!GSIOpenSSH, !UberFTP, the Condor !ClassAds library, !PyGlobusUrlCopy, and Netlogger) that some people find useful. You will not need these for most installations.

<pre><b>&gt; pacman -get <nop>http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_136_cache:VDT-Client</b></pre>

---++ Site Verification

Now you're ready to run the full CE site verification test suite. All elements of this test should now pass.
<tt>
(NB: To run the site verify script you should not be *root* )

$ grid-proxy-init <br>
Enter "<i>Your Passphrase</i>"<br>
$ source ./setup.sh<br>

---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to OsgCEAuthorization and authorize other users before registering your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!) 
To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the webform located [[http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=68&elMenu=Grid%20Support][here]].


To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=68&elMenu=Grid%20Support][webform]] located under the OSG [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=47&Itemid=65][Administrator Support page]]. If you are registering into the ITB, be sure to check the appropriate box for which grid catalog you are registering with. You should receive an email response automatically back from the GOC to the operations contact you supplied. If this response doesn't arrive within a reasonable delay, please resubmit your registration.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a site to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make site and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.

---++ Firewalls

Grid components are distributed throughout the network, and services 
such as gatekeepers and data movement utilties are required to be 
accessible to the dynamic cloud of clients and peer services.
This ditributed and dynamic requirement places the burden
of the security on the implementation of the application.

Due to the discovery of significant vulnerabilities in recent years, network-based applications are untrusted by default. To solve the application
problem effort has focused on developing and deploying firewalls which
restricts full and free network access.  (You might say that this is analogous to building 
a house with no doors. Is it safe? Yes. Is it useful? No.)

Some essential network-based applications have been
"hardened," such as mail relay services, web servers, and secure
shell daemons. These are further protected further by IP address 
filtering to prevent access from unknown hosts or domains.

Grid components which are located behind network firewall 
face special challenges for Grid setup and operations. 

There are two styles of firewalls usually encountered. 

	* A network firewall which is upstream from your server 
(usually centrally maintained). This blocks all traffic to your 
host. 

	* Host-based firewalls which are setup and maintained 
by individual host administrators. This is usually setup and configured
by the <b>iptables</b> program which filters incoming network packets which 
arrive for the host.

 In addition to host-based firewalls, hosts can choose to 
 implement host based access rules (usually setup with the <b>tcp_wrapper</b>
  or <b>hosts_allow</b> utilties.

Network traffic can be blocked at the firewall for both incoming and outgoing dataflow
depending on hostnames, ip addresses, ports and protocols. 


A common setup is to allow any outgoing connection,
while significantly (if not completely) restricting 
incoming connections.  The Globus project provides thorough documentation on this subject which will not be repeated here.  It is strong encouraged that you read the document <A HREF="http://www.globus.org/security/v2.0/firewalls.html">Globus Toolkit Firewall Requirements</A> to avoid issues which may arise from firewall configuration.


IP port usage which may require firewall updates:

	* MDS: 2135/tcp
	* GRAM: 2119/tcp
	* GridFTP: 2811/tcp
	* GRAM callback: contiguous range if tcp ports as specified by definition <b>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=start,stop</b> .  A minmun range of 100 for a small site. 
	* Monalisa: 9000/udp (for ABping measurements).  These are specified in the file <B>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/<I>cluster_name</I>/ml.properties</B>
	
GRAM and GridFTP need to know the port range that you've opened up. You need to set two environment variables, GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE. Some people set these in the xinetd configuration, but you can also set it in $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh. Then these will be used by GRAM, GridFTP, and any clients that require them.

By the way, the VDT is working on a better solution for setting these variables, and it will hopefully be in an upcoming VDT release. 

These ports and protocols <i>must be open</i> to all grid clients and
server machines participating in the grid in order to provide minimal
functionality.

You also may need to open the following optional ports for additional Grid services:

	* GIIS: 2136/tcp
	* GSISSH: 22/tcp
	* MyProxy: 7512/tcp
Here is a sample of the a /etc/hosts.allow with the GLOBUS services opened:
	* RLS server: 39281/tcp

Here is a sample of the a <tt>/etc/hosts.allow</tt> with the GLOBUS services opened:
<verbatim>

# cat /etc/hosts.allow
#
# hosts.allow	This file describes the names of the hosts which are
#					allowed to use the local INET services, as decided
#					by the '/usr/sbin/tcpd' server.
#
sshd: 129.79.6.113 
ALL : localhost
vdt-run-gsiftp.sh : ALL
vdt-run-gsiftf2.sh : ALL
vdt-run-globus-gatekeeper.sh : ALL
</verbatim>

*For RH9, RHEL3 or compatible iptables systems*

The default firewall configuration for Red Hat's iptables sets the system up with a stateful packet filter. This is different than some legacy RH7 systems as by default no ports that are not explicitly opened by the iptables script will be open. This includes high numbered ports that are often used by grid services. 

If your preference is to leave as much of the stateful packet filtering in place but enable just those grid services you want to deploy then you can use the following instructions. 

Two changes need to be made to an OSG gateway with a host based iptables stateful firewall. 

First is the configuration of the firewall itself. On RHEL or similar systems this is done in /etc/sysconfig/iptables

The Chain RH-Firewall-1-INPUT is a default chain for RHEL3. This chain is also sometimes called INPUT. Make sure the following rules use the chain that other rules in /etc/sysconfig/iptables do. 

Note: For GSISSH this port is often already open for systems. You can use either this rule or the default rule setup at install time if you selected custom firewall and enabled ssh. 

<verbatim>
# Globus: Requires addition configuration in /etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper
# set: env = GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,50000
# This allows up to 10,000 ports and matches the globus config.
# How globus is configured to use these ports is subject to change in an upcoming
# release
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 40000:50000 -j ACCEPT
# Monalisa, grabs 3 ports from the following range
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9000:9010 -j ACCEPT
# Gridftp
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2811 -j ACCEPT
# MDS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2135 -j ACCEPT
# GRAM
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2119 -j ACCEPT

# Optional Services
# RLS Server
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 39281 -j ACCEPT
# MyProxy
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 7512 -j ACCEPT
# GSISSH/SSH
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# GIIS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2136 -j ACCEPT
# GUMS/VOMS
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
</verbatim>


Second is the configuration of globus to use the above port range. _This may change in upcoming VDT releases, see above_


/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper
<verbatim>
service globus-gatekeeper
{
			socket_type = stream
			protocol = tcp
			wait = no
			user = root
			instances = UNLIMITED
			cps = 400 10
			server = $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-run-globus-gatekeeper.sh
			env	 = GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=40000,50000
			disable = no
You should probably also add the port range to $VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/globus-job-manager.conf, 
</verbatim>

You should probably also add the port range to <tt>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/globus-job-manager.conf</tt>, 
to be sure it's always picked up, by adding the following line:

<verbatim>
		  -globus-tcp-port-range 40000,50000
</verbatim>

_Note: $VDT_LOCATION should be set by the pacman installer_
<verbatim>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables restart

<verbatim><b>
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables restart</b>
Flushing firewall rules:											  [  OK  ]
# /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload
Reloading configuration:											  [  OK  ]
#

</verbatim>

---++Troubleshooting Guide
As you install, monitor the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log.  

	* If pacman tries to retrieve something from a website that's having problems, you'll get an error message that's unrelated to the real problem because pacman can't recognize 404 errors when downloading tarballs.  For example, when the PRIMA download site was down, it told us the file wasn't in the correct format:
<pre>
vdt-untar is untarring prima-0.3.x86_rh_9.tar.gz
gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
