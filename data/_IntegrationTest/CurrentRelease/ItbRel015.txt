---++Problems
(Please put your name next to your item)

	* SiteAdmins documentation references 0.1.4 ITB release.
	* No instructions given to start Core MIS services in general instructions.
	* Core MIS release description is not specific.
	* Initial pacman-3.11 hardwired to use python binary 'python', which on RH7 is 1.5.2.  To fix, edit
	  python/build_python_if_necessary.py and src/pacman to use the right python.
	* Need policy instructions on minimal GUMS config
	* Globus-Client not installed with 'pacman -get iVDGL:osg-0.1.5'.  Workaround: from install area, do a 
	  'pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache:Globus-Client'
	* Previously running edg-crl-upgrade not stopped during install.
	* If condor-from-the-VDT is requested, /etc/init.d/condor is not replaced.
	* LDAP service for MDS is mentioned but no mention of what is MDS or why will you ever run it.
	* Do you have to start up jClarens?
---++Summary

	* VO services should be registered using the [[ItbVo][VO registration]] procedure.
	* New MIS-CI version

The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 interface, with additions for implicit 
space reservation.  CMSSrmdCache provides the readiness plan. The service will be available to all registered OSG VO's.
To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client.  This is available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available and should probably be the version deployed.)
