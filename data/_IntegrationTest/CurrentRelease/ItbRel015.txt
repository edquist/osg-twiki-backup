%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Summary of this Release

	* This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.1.5, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). Detailed installation procedures are available in the OSGCoreInstallGuide.  Guides for VO administrators are also provided below. 
	* This release of the ITB will incorporate major changes in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/%OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%/index.html][VDT %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%]]
	* VO services should be registered using the [[ItbVo][VO registration]] procedure.
	* New MIS-CI version 0.2.5p1.
	
---++ Validation

Validation of ITB release 0.1.5.  

	* ITB 0.1.5 validation coordination page,  RelCanItb015Val.
	* Validation page is located at the ValidationPage.  

---++Problems
(Please put your name next to your item)
	* New prompt from monitoring/configure-grid3.sh, explanation is needed (S. Timm 4/19/05)
	* No instructions given to start Core MIS services in general instructions. (Steve Timm)--fixed
	* Core MIS release description is not specific.
	* Initial pacman-3.11 hardwired to use python binary 'python', which on RH7 is 1.5.2.  To fix, edit
	  python/build_python_if_necessary.py and src/pacman to use the right python.
	* Need policy instructions on minimal GUMS config (Steve Timm)
	* If condor-from-the-VDT is requested, /etc/init.d/condor is not replaced (Fixed in VDT 1.3.6)
	* LDAP service for MDS is mentioned but no mention of what is MDS or why will you ever run it.  (Steve Timm)
	* No obvious explanation of what orange, red, green mean in the MonALISA display (Steve Timm) orange vo_jobs, mean no jobs running, red means missing grid3 file
	* There is no instructions for site admins for creating apps, tmp, data, tmp_wn directories and the correct permissions to apply, also I believe that there should also be a apps/etc directory (Mark Green)
	* Provide clear directions on how to install GUMS.- privilegeOSG section does not mention that GUMS server isn't installed in default OSG install. (Steve Timm)
	*  problem $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt isn't made, in at least 2 different installs. (Steve Timm) workaround, copy from 1.3.4 version, symptom, vo_jobs,vo_io show red in MonALISA.  Fix is claimed to be added to OSG 0.1.5 cache to put this file back.
	* Not clear when in the install sequence to do the GUMS installation (nate suggests before doing the core installation itself), or how to change from one GUMS source to another.  Core install guide does not mention GUMS at all...
		* Clarification:  I'd suggestion installing VOMS first, then one GUMS server per site and then all the gatekeepers.  This is more of an incremental approach then gatekeeper-VOMS-GUMS and it will let you ensure that all the requirements are in place for each step.  
	* Configure GUMS section is light on details and heavy on redirection.  Too many links to other web sites - would be best to have on a single page in a recipe format.
	* Gotta find some better, more descriptive names for sections.  What the heck is a PrivilegeSite?  Eschew Obfuscation!  
	* Instructions on edg-mkgridmap are wrong in privilegesiteadmins guide, have to fix (can't because it is locked at the moment).  Steve Timm.  Says it's installed automatically but isn't anymore.
	* Should the D0 vo be included? also who sets the policy for osg on what vo's are in and which ones are out?  
	*  After installing VDT1.3.5, first I set a password for root in mysql, then tried to do the GUMS addAdmin. addAdmin failed because it assumed there was no password required for root account. (Doug O.)
		* (Nate again) The VDT has a couple places where people with access to the local box can do bad things.  By default anyone with a login can administer VOMS and muck with the !MySQL server (GUMS, VOMS, RLS).  I brought this up in the past and people weren't too worried.  If that's changed I can bump up the priority of a fix.  For now you can run "configure_apache --secure" and set a password for root@localhost's !MySQL account, but you need to add your first VOMS and GUMS admins first.

---++Guides for Site and VO Administrators

The SiteAdmins web describes how services listed below are installed, configured, and checked
by the site administrators.  To shut down services prior to the upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
For a detailed step-by-step guide to the core installation procedures, see the OSGCoreInstallGuide.

The VoAdmins page provides information for VO administrators.  There are also some new pages specific to the authentication / authorization chain available:
	* PrivilegeVOWhatToDo 
	* PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo
	* GoldenChainDebugging for debugging the privilege components and their interaction.

The [[ItbVo][VO registration]] procedure should be used to communicate a VO level service to 
grid resources (sites/gatekeepers). 

---++ Pacman Recommendation
The installation instructions are based on PacmanTool.  For this release, we recommend *Pacman 3.11*.

---++ OSG Core Description
The OSG core installation is done with the Pacman command <verbatim>pacman -get iVDGL:osg-0.1.5.</verbatim> This delivers the following components:

	* Root package: <a href="http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/osg-0.1.5.pacman">osg-0.1.5.pacman</a>
	* Depends on [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/osg-auto-0.1.5.pacman][osg-auto-0.1.5.pacman]] which sets some default answers to VDT configuration questions. It also distributes the OSG Release Notes. 
		* VDTSETUP_AGREE_TO_LICENSES=y
		* VDTSETUP_ENABLE_GATEKEEPER=y
		* VDTSETUP_ENABLE_GRIDFTP=y

		* [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_135_cache/MyProxy.pacman][MyProxy]]
	* Depends on [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/grid3-schema.pacman][grid3-schema.pacman]] which installs the Globus MDS Grid3 schema.
	* Dependent package: [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/osg-grid3-info-prov.pacman][osg-grid3-info-prov.pacman]] which installs the Globus MDS Grid3 information providers.
	* Dependent package: [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/vo-0.1.5.pacman][vo-0.1.5.pacman]] which installs the configurtion script to retrieve VO information.
	* Dependent package: [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/MIS-CI.pacman][MIS-CI.pacman]] which installs the current Monitoring Core Infrastructure descibed below.

---++ VDT
We will use release %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION% of the VirtualDataToolkit %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%, see <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/%OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%/release.html">release notes</a>. 

---++ Globus 4 gridftp

Included with VDT.  The GridFTP page describes the service integration in detail.

---++ Core MIS
Description of the CoreMIS infrastructure to be used.  MIS-CI Version 0.2.5p1  
The Core MIS will be configured by the configure_misci.sh script as a post installation
 step.

---++ Grid Cat
Description of the GridCat site monitoring catalog to be used.

---++ Monalisa
Any special configuration needed for MonALISA for this release, noted here.

---++ Privilege and VO services infrastructure
Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release.
As of this release, the PRIMA interpretation of extended proxies has been fixed to match the VOMS usage.
Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization decisions is supported as of this release (0.1.5) but not in earlier releases.
The GUMS version should be 1.0.1 from VDT 1.3.5 and the VOMS Admin and VOMS Server should be installed from the VDT 1.3.5.
to ensure correct functioning.

---++ Discovery Service
Description of the 
[[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]]
deployed in this release.  Here are the DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.

The Discovery Service version 0.5.3 is deployed on a JClarens server version 0.5.3 for this OTB release.

---++ Disk Resource Manager

	* We are not recommending installtion and use of the disk based storage resource manager, SRM-DRM.
	* Stay tuned to DiskResourceManager for updates.


---++ Site Verify

The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the pacman cache as of this release.


---++ CMS Tier1 SE

The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 interface, with additions for implicit 
space reservation.  CMSSrmdCache provides the readiness plan. The service will be available to all registered OSG VO's.
To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client.  This is available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available and should probably be the version deployed.)
