---++Introduction

This is a list of sites and VOs participating in this workshop for building a release candidate. These
are a subset of the ITB and will be working dynamically throughout the workshop to create the candidate.
This means that the contents of ITB 0.1.5 are likely to change over the course of the next two days and 
people should expect to need to be tightly coupled to the workshop to understand the finegrained timeline
of the 0.1.5 development. At the end of the workshop, we will freeze an ITB 0.1.5 release for distribution to 
the rest of the ITB for further testing. The goal is also to deliver this to the Provisioning activity as an OSG Release Candidate.
