---++Agenda


1) Status of ITB 0.1.6 installs

Sites
http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/
   
Known problems http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/ItbRel016#Known_Problems

Need to find out when Gabrielle's patch for GUMS 1.1.0 will
arrive for VDT 1.3.7.  Can we live with this problem+workaround
in OSG 0.2.1?  Workaround is simple, problem is minor.

Underscores in vo names/subgroups is also minor.  Don't do that!

64-bit support.  VDT is waiting for a volunteer to test the
32-bit perl workaround until the VDT obtains a 64-bit machine.

CMS and Atlas current issues seem to be minor local configuration
issues, not related to the OSG deployment.  They are ready for
stress testing on 0.1.6.

GridCat state flag is new in 0.1.6.  Earlier versions can create
the file and add the line in the file manually.  If someone has
already installed 0.1.6, do they need to reinstall 0.2.1 from the
cache?  Rob recommends a reinstall.  What about sites that don't
want to register with the ITB, but are running a production
cluster before the 0.2.1 deployment?  Rob says that this is a
transient problem and will be a non-issue until 0.2.1 is
available.  Just wait until 0.2.1.

2) GIP service integration status/needs
 
http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/GenericInformationProviders

We need VOs who really need this to step forward with some
documentation effort.  Do we have any volunteers?  Yujun at the
USCMS ITB site will help with this.  Michael and Suresh will work
with this at the Caltech site.

3) Status of validations
   Mark - ACDC metrics, http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/

   Others?

Mark wants job submitters to look at ACDC and drill down to the
Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo jobs and see if it shows what's really happening.  The
gatekeeper page will show resource usage for gatekeepers across
grids by selecting multiple grids (grid3, osg-itb, acdc).  Site
admins should validate that the gatekeeper load/memory usage is
being reported correctly.  This information is currently being
collected via globus-job-run, but will be collected using MIS-CI
once the MIS-CI activity starts.  Leigh has a script that will
enable sites to automatically notify ACDC once a site is online.

Can we add a ACDC data validation step to the OSG installation
validation steps?  ACDC is not ready for a service readiness plan
because not all modules are done or fully exercised yet (such as
the gridftp module).  Sites are requested to go to the TG-MIS group
and make requests and comments.


4) Discovery Service readiness plan, http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/SoftwareDiscoveryService

The service was presented.  Some issues that were discussed:

Each Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo uses a different way to represent the software cache (CMS uses
  SCRAM, Atlas uses locations.txt).  As such, each Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo would need to create
  and distribute a module for getting this software information.

Can we have a generic way of picking up these software
  installations, from $APP, for example, so that we don't need
  all of these modules?  This is a job for MIS-CI and Mike will
  bring it up at the next MIS-CI meeting.

5) GridEx

I didn't catch the question.  See Leigh's email that was sent out right
before the meeting.

 

---++Issues

   * GridCat state flag:
      * http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide-0.1.6#Setting_Site_State_To_Active
      * Mail from Bockjoo
<pre>
Dear All,
As mendated by the ITB (see the deploy meeting minutes below), default 
site state bit will be assumed to be inactive and the site status dot 
will become grey in GridCat display.
This action in GridCat display will be starting effective from 4:30 P.M. 
EDT.

I added a subsection called the "Setting Site State To Active" in the 
Installation Guide and GridCat twiki: http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/GridCat
http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide#Setting_Site_State_To_Active

In order for a site to become proactively active, the file $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info
has to be edited and the value of the variable, grid_site_state_bit, should be set to 1, i.e., the content of 
$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info should look something like: export grid_site_state_bit=1

Please let me know if the effective time should be changed. Thank you, Bockjoo
</pre>
