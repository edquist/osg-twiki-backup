---++Issues

	* GridCat state flag:

		* Mail from Bockjoo
<pre>
Dear All,
As mendated by the ITB (see the deploy meeting minutes below), default 
site state bit will be assumed to be inactive and the site status dot 
will become grey in GridCat display.
This action in GridCat display will be starting effective from 4:30 P.M. 
EDT.

I added a subsection called the "Setting Site State To Active" in the 
Installation Guide and GridCat twiki: http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/GridCat
http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide#Setting_Site_State_To_Active

In order for a site to become proactively active, the file $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info
has to be edited and the value of the variable, grid_site_state_bit, should be set to 1, i.e., the content of 
$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info should look something like: export grid_site_state_bit=1

Please let me know if the effective time should be changed. Thank you, Bockjoo
</pre>
