Information for the ITB Virtual Workshop, March 22, 2006 (9:00-16:00 CST).   ESnet ad-hoc video system will be used, bridged with VRVS.

3 methods of connecting:

   * ESNet H.323 client (see [[http://www.ecs.es.net][http://www.ecs.es.net]] to register a new client, or [[http://www-staff.es.net/~mikep/adhoc/codian.htm][http://www-staff.es.net/~mikep/adhoc/codian.htm]] for more information on connecting), using meeting ID 88482.
   * ESnet phone dial-in is 1-510-883-7860 -- enter the meeting ID (88482) followed by the # sign when it answers.  There is a hard limit of 23 total phone connections for all of the ESNet conferences, so hopefully most people will use video and not phone.
