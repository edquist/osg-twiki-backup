---++ Discussion and issues

   * Two options for installing the ITB - with, and without web services.  SGE GIP configs were working. This was from an earlier release.
   * Problems from John W: current package doesnt bring down /etc/grid-security in the expected location.  Its now a local link (see TRUSTED_CA link). Change this? Also, brings down web services clients. 
   * Monalisa and Condor must be obtained from the VDT. 
   * Using the vo package from the production OSG.
   * For job managers outside the VDT install, you need to setup the environment variables Monalisa. 
   * What including the about web services client on pre-web services installations.
   * What does an OSG client install do?  Whats in VDT-Client?  (includes, globus client tools, condor-g, certificates, kx509, voms clients ...).
   * Monalisa - not installed by default? The Trash/Deployment document is silent on this, is not part of the functional release 0.4.0.  Need some clarification on this from Deployment.
   * Is Bockjoo working on a WS test for GridCat.

---++ Testbed updates and plans
   
   * UB did install the ITB, had difficulty with bringing up GRIS.
   * Alan reports that there are problems running the globus test scripts when installed as separate, user directories.

   * Other sites doing web servics pieces: UB, BNL, IU-Feynman
   * John W/Fnal: pre and WS.
   * PU - will start a fresh install of WS install.
