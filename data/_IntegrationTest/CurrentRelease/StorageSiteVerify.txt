---++Introduction

The basic scope of the project is to provide the equivalent of site_verify for Storage Elements on OSG.  In other words, we will provide a tool that will provide basic information and validation of a Storage Element, most useful for site admins doing basic installation, configuration, and debugging.

---++ GIP

The first priority is to validate the static information provided to the GIP.  This has been identified as a source of significant difficulty for admins bringing their Storage Elements up on OSG.  As a starting point, I (burt) propose that we integrate the GIP validation code from [[http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat/home][GridCat]].

---++ Secondary priorities: TBD
