---++Agenda
---+++ Managed-fork job manager integration issues
       
       Need to have a test plan for installation on top of PBS, LSF, and SGE.
       The condor installed with the job manager should not interface with 
       existing job scheduler or monitoring systems
           
---++++ Possible effects on GridCat, Operations Dashboard 
    This could lead to false positives for operational problems on a resource
    UCSD currenlty using this.
    
---+++++ For the ITB this will be optionally installed and tested    
   
        
---+++ default installation of pre-WS and WS Gram for ITB 0.3.6
 

   Installing both seems like the correct way to go.  VDT nitely tests
   both services at the same time with no problems, but not at scale.
  
   Configuring to execute at boot time..
     WS needs pbs logs... etc.

   MDS4 is installed and setup by default, Mark will use the 
   Operations Dashboard from the MDS4. GIP/GLUE/BDII -->  GIP/GLUE/MDS4

   Need to LDIF to XML translation for TG interoperation.
   

---+++ VDS requirement for the CE

The current VDS is working, for the ITB 0.3.6 We only install
 VDS-Worker will be installed on the CE.


---+++ Pruning the ITB gridcat 

   The current ITB will be updated with a fresh installation on March 3rd that will rely on 
   the Registration
   database ITB. The GridCat will be assembled and managed by the GOC with mostly the
   same operational procedures.

---+++ Recap/review of
   [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0602d&L=osg-int&T=0&F=&S=&P=3370][GIP for the SE]]

      issues condor group characteristics,
      representation of SE by CE and bindings between them this needs more work
      better documentation could be done

      CE which currently have an assocatiated SE,  Purdue/BNL Mark will starting working    
      to valididate.

     need to have documentation list.  Validation of the release needs to correctly represent
     this and create best practices.

---+++ CRL's on worker nodes, followup 
  [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0602d&L=osg-int&D=0&T=0&P=4559][discussion]]

    Alan.. CRL too much over head.  Alian Roy, would sqiud help this..
    We need the workernode package.  But how to handle the CRL's is a 
    an issue which could be handled with out the overhead. Will work
    toward a new solution.
---+++ Assigning documentation volunteers
  [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/DocumentationTable036and037][Doc's list]]

   Current status is that ITB and OSG 0.4.0 are in line.  We need to develop this for
   the new version.  Using the table please assign yourself some work.

- OSG service overview discussion and 
  [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGServiceOverview][review]]
---+++ GridEx summary/issues

    no issues.

---+++ Timeframe for ITB 0.3.6 readiness

  ITB will make a pre-0.3.6 release on March 3rd

---+++ ITB Gridcat status, ready for production

    Until the storage elements are working we should hold off.
    "OSG_GRID" Gridcat service to correctly support VDS (LIGo and SDSS )
