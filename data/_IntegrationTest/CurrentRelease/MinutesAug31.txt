   * Patch Process for VDT 1.3.9, 1.3.10 and 1.3.11 (Scheduled for Monday September 4) via pacman -get 
   * VDT 1.3.11 status update since Aug 10: Only change has been work on a security patch.
   * ITB 0.5.0 issues since Aug 10:
      * Work continues on a modification to the configure-osg script to incorporate start/stop config-gip scripts.
      * Further work is needed on configuring CE-Mon. Preliminary documentation for manual configuration completed
      * A script automating much of the CE-Mon configuration is being assembled by J. Weigand.
   * Operations issues
      * Removal of the MIS-CI package: impact on packages, representation in GLUE schema
         * GridCat still provides essential services and catalog capabilities. 
         * Request monitoring-wg  provide a capabilities and maturities matrix for understanding the trade-offs between monitoring frameworks.
      * SRM_CONFIG: osg-client ISSUE=2291 PROJ=71, need for setting in a script for users:  A. Sill experienced problems with 32 bit 
        install of the srmcp client. Better documentation/characterization of the problem needed to guide practice. Recurring trouble tickets
        indicate that having SRM_CONFIG set for the SRM-Client package can reduce configuration confusion.

      * Possible Schedule:  OSG 0.5.0 (now)
      * VDT 1.3.12 (September ?)
      * OSG 0.5.1 (containing VDT 1.3.12, date TBD)   
   * Any Other Business:
      * S. Timm commented that Head Node resource demands have been reduced by recent work on CeMon in OSG 0.5.0 
      * D. Meyers recommended better characterization of resource demands on head node from work loads and monitoring services.
      * L. Grunhoefer discussed that an Ops Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo has been created for site functional tests. 
      * C. Green provided a detailed roadmap on the upcoming Gratia accounting package, Condor and PBS probes, and deliverable for
         VDT 1.3.12. See an example of the Gratia reports at: http://cd-psg2.fnal.gov:8884/gratia-reporting/ Chris Green
         comments:  "There is a gap right now in data upon which to report, so to see something meaningful please change the    
         default date range to run from (eg) the beginning of August. If you have any problems with or suggestions for any of 
         the reports, please send email to the mailing list, <osg-accounting@fnal.gov>."
