---++Introduction
The DRM Disk Resource Manager is a service that provides a SRM interface on top of a normal unix filesystem. Version 1.2.x of the DRM service supports v1.1 of the SRM. For more information on DRM please refer to the [[https://plone3.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/activities/DRM/docs/][documentation section]] on the OSG plone for the DRM activity's plone. 
---++Installation
To install the DRM you will need to decide where and how you will want the service to be used. The service may be deployed as a service running on the same host as the CE service or it can be deployed on a seperate host. We will make specific recomendations on this as we gain experiance testing and validating the service. The installation process for deployment of the service on the same server as the CE is described in the [[https://plone3.opensciencegrid.org/opensciencegrid/activities/DRM/install/][installation section]] on the OSG plone for the DRM deployment's plone. 
---++Validation
The validation procedure is currently under development in the DRM deployment's readiness activity. 
---++Integration Plans
We are currently working on the DRM readiness activity and plan to complete that before we request for for a full integration on to the OSG-ITB integration testbed.
