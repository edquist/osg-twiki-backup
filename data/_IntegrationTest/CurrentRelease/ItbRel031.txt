---++Obsolescence Note

%RED% 12/20/05: Do not install! %ENDCOLOR% See ItbRel034 for the next available release description.

---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.3.1, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). It is based on [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/index.html][VDT 1.3.8]].  We are providing two deployment options - a fully web services based installation, and one which installs the pre-web services Globus which is important to many VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's for backwards compatiblity and migration.  The main deployment and validation of this release occurred during the *[[WorkshopFnalNov05][November 30-December 1]]* workshop at Fermilab.



---++ Validation and Work Plan
Descriptions of validation exercises of both applications and services using ITB release 0.3.1.  
  
   * The ITB "homepage" for the current release is IntegrationTestbed.  (*Site admins: go here to register your site.*)
   * OSGCEInstallGuide is the working set of instructions.
   * Descriptions of validations of the ITB 0.3 series of testbeds are located at the * ValidationPage. *


---++Known Issues and Problems
<b>Please put your name and the date next to your item. %GREEN%Green%ENDCOLOR% items are thought to be corrected. Also include a resolution or work-around (if available) with you name and date.</b>

---+++For Documentation
The following documentation twiki's need to be reviewed:

   * OSGCEInstallGuide (for site admins)
   * LocalStorageRequirements (general reference)
   * LocalStorageConfiguration (for site admnistrators)
   * LocalStorageUse (for users)


---+++For VDT 

   * Known problems in VDT 1.3.8, [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/problems.html][here]]
   * OSGCEInstallGuide says that x86_64 platforms are not supported, Alain Roy said in his talk 
     that they are supported.  Which is right?  (S. Timm 11/30/2005) (x86_64 VDT works, but x86_64 PRIMA does not. -- Burt, 12/1/2005)


---+++ For !MonALISA

   * Monalisa was not installed by default in an earlier version of 0.3.1 (it is now). <br>
      <font color=green> It is now installed (but not configured) by default. The MonALISA twiki web gives all the relevant nstructions.</font>

   * Editing <tt>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/VDTFarm/ml.properties</tt> does not propagate to <tt>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/MonaLisa/monalisa.properties</tt> (this is probably by design?)<p>
       <b>Comment (Main.JohnWeigand 12/14/05):</b> <font color=green> Yes it is by design and you should always
       update the  ./vdt-app-data/...../monalisa.properities file using the configure_monalisa script
       when changing any properties set by it. This file is also used by the configure_gip script, as well, and should always be run after the 
        configure_monalisa script.</font>

   * <b>configure_monalisa script</b> ( Main.JohnWeigand 12/14/05): 
       If you are not using Ganglia and answered 'n' when asked
         "Will you connect to a Ganglia instance (y/n)" by the configure_monalisa script. 
         The configure_monalisa script should be commenting  out this line in the VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/VDTFarm/vdtFarm.conf file:
   <verbatim>
        *PN_vdt{monIGangliaTCP, localhost, 8649}%30 
   </verbatim>
      <font color=darkgreen><b>RESOLVED (Main.JohnWeigand 12/16/05)</b> -  Fixed in VDT 1.3.9 and accessible via OSG:0.3.4.
      [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/support/tickets/1265.html][VDT support ticket 1265]]  initiated 12/14/05.<br/>
      <b>Work-around (John Weigand 12/14/05):</b> Comment this line line manually with a "#"<br/></font>


---+++ For !GridCat

   If you are a new ITB site, don't forget to follow instructions on the IntegrationTestbed twiki web for
registering your site.

---+++ For GIP

Please discuss with Main.AnandPadmanabhan validation for GIP (see further GenericInformationProviders).
   * configure_gip looks for monalisa.properties in <tt>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc</tt>, but it is now in <tt>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/MonaLisa</tt>.
   * GIP doesn't know about new SITE_READ and SITE_WRITE variables in osg-attribute.conf,

---+++ For Storage Issues

The small group needs to convene to work on a "site-verify" for SE:  (Burt, Neha, Shaowen, ...)



---+++ For Grid3/OSG Specific Attributes

The new configuration of site-specific attributes (for example, all the variables associated with LocalStorageConfiguration) are changing for OSG.  The names of these attributes used to have the prefix =GRID3_=. These will change to =OSG_=.  Monitoring, information providers, and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo software installation scripts will likely be affected.
   * Question: how long do we provide backwards compatibility?<br>
       <font color=green>(Main.JohnWeigand 12/16/05):  Both the OSG_ and GRID3_ attributes are defined in the osg-attributes.conf file.  
         The grid3-info.conf is symlinked in the monitoring directory to osg-attributes.sh. .... and a link has been created for both files 
         in GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc.</font>
   * New site-specific attributes are not yet being put out in the grid3/mds schema.

---+++For !MDS/GRIS
   * Main.JohnWeigand (12/1/05): In the /etc/init.d/gris start script, the  check that the startup is successful (check of $?) will never work.  The 'su' is the only comand that will return a failure.  To verify success/failure, you need to 'ps' and 'grep' for grid_info_daemon.
   * Main.HorstSeverini (12/1/05): Why does 'ldapsearch -x' (anonymous bind) still work? I thought we decided back in February at the first OSG integration meeting that we were going to turn that off and only allow authenticated access?

---+++ For !GridEx

Jeff Weber will be running GridEx as 0.3.1 sites come online.


---++ OSG Compute Element (CE) Description
The OSG CE installation has two paths with this version.

| *Pre-Web Services* |  *Web Services* |
| osg-0.3.1 | osg-0.3.1-ws |


These packages deliver the following components (If you want both, install osg-0.3.1 first, then in the same install directory install 0.3.1-ws. Detailed instructions should be in OSGCEInstallGuide):
 
|  *Pre-Web Services* | *Web Services* | *Description* |
|  osg-auto-1.3.8  | osg-auto-1.3.8.-ws | provides a VDT questions setup, osg-version |
|  VDT_138   |  VDT_138-ws  | components from the VDT 1.3.8 package |
|  grid3-schema  || Grid3 Schema for GRIS |
|  osg-grid3-info-prov  || configure-osg and grid3 information files |
|  OSG:vo-0.2.1  || OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's |
|  OSG:gums:cron  || Fix for Client Gums installation |
|  srm-cp  || SRM client tool |
|  MIS-CI  || Monitoring interface |
|  osg-gip  || Generic information provider |
|  site-verify  || Site Verification |


---++ OSG Client 

There is a package of client tools available separately:

=pacman -get iVDGL:osg-client=

At the moment this is just VDT-Client (Condor-G, VDS, etc) from the current release of VDT.  We keep this as
a distinct package in case we need to add something in between VDT releases or tools perhaps not included 
in VDT.

---++ OSG Worker Node Client

This is a package of client grid tools expected to be made available jobs executing from worker nodes.  The idea is to provide site administrators flexibility (for performance or installation purposes) in serving these capabilties to client jobs.  Specific content to be determined, but the basic agreement to date is that this should include self-contained Globus clients (including certificate directories) and SRM clients for access to local storage elements.

   * Twiki page with description: WorkerNodeClient


---++ Core MIS
Description of the CoreMIS infrastructure to be used, MIS-CI Version 0.3.0. 
The Core MIS will be configured by the configure_misci.sh script as a post installation step.

---++ Information Services

Include here information about GIP's, etc.

   * OsgInformationService Overview 
      * GLUESchema 1.2
      * GenericInformationProviders (GIP)
      * Grid3Schema
      * Grid3InformationProvider


---++ Privilege and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Services Infrastructure

Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release. From before, the PRIMA callout for extended proxy certificates has been fixed to match the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS usage. Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization is supported too. 

%RED% *Anything special to note regarding Privilege*? %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% *Update this:* The GUMS version should be 1.1.0 from VDT 1.3.8 and the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Server should be installed from the VDT 1.3.8 to ensure correct functioning. %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Discovery and Job Monitoring Services
   * DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.  This should be performed by anyone who wishes to run a local discovery service registry.  The Discovery service will be used to catalog the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and SRM servers on the OSG.
   * DiscoveryServicePublication instructions for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and DRM service providers.  This should be run by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server administrators in order to get their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service registered with the Discovery Service.
   * See VDT 1.3.8


---++ Site Validation

The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the OSG pacman cache in this release.
