---++ Mail from VDT

In VDT 1.3.8, we changed the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server to run as the 'daemon' user instead of 'root'. At the time, I couldn't figure out how to make the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server use an HTTP service certificate, so I switched to using a copy of the host certificate and its key (the vomscert.pem and vomskey.pem files in /etc/grid-security).

Recently, this change caused some justified concern in OSG: It may be a security risk to reuse the host certificate, and it causes a maintenance problem when the original host certificate expires. However, people seem to have accepted the situation for the most part.

For the upcoming VDT 1.3.11, I have upgraded VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and have improved substantially our VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS configuration process. I revisited the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS certificate usage problem and finally figured out how to run VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS using an HTTP service certificate. But before I just switch things back, I wanted to make sure it's the right move for the OSG community.

So, I propose to stop copying the host certificate for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and instead configure VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS to use the HTTP service certificate. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin uses the certificate to create the vomses file entry that references the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server with the correct DN. When using the service certificate, the service type 'http/' is prepended to the hostname component of the DN, so you get a DN like this:

    /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=http/vdt-rhas4-ia32.cs.wisc.edu

CRITICAL ISSUE: If an existing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server is replaced with one installed from VDT 1.3.11 with the proposed change, the vomses entry by which the server is known to the rest of the grid will change. The new vomses entry would have to be propagated to clients before those clients will be able to contact the new VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server. Is this acceptable?

Generating the new, correct entry will be part of the installation, so getting it is easy. And I think OSG has a mechanism to propagate vomses entries, but I'm not sure how it works. We'd really like to get away from using a copy of the host certificate, but if the pain of using service certificates is too great, then we will reconsider.

Finally, what will the VDT do if there is no HTTP service certificate at installation time? We'd try to follow the pattern we use elsewhere: Configure VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS as best as we can and put messages in the post-install/README file explaining that the service certificate must be in place before the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server will run.

Send us your comments, concerns, and questions, and we'll try to address them here.
