---++ Mail from VDT

In VDT 1.3.8, we changed the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server to run as the 'daemon' user instead of 'root'. At the time, I couldn't figure out how to make the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server use an HTTP service certificate, so I switched to using a copy of the host certificate and its key (the vomscert.pem and vomskey.pem files in /etc/grid-security).

Recently, this change caused some justified concern in OSG: It may be a security risk to reuse the host certificate, and it causes a maintenance problem when the original host certificate expires. However, people seem to have accepted the situation for the most part.

For the upcoming VDT 1.3.11, I have upgraded Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and have improved substantially our Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS configuration process. I revisited the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS certificate usage problem and finally figured out how to run Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS using an HTTP service certificate. But before I just switch things back, I wanted to make sure it's the right move for the OSG community.

So, I propose to stop copying the host certificate for Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and instead configure Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS to use the HTTP service certificate. Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin uses the certificate to create the vomses file entry that references the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server with the correct DN. When using the service certificate, the service type 'http/' is prepended to the hostname component of the DN, so you get a DN like this:

    /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=http/vdt-rhas4-ia32.cs.wisc.edu

CRITICAL ISSUE: If an existing Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server is replaced with one installed from VDT 1.3.11 with the proposed change, the vomses entry by which the server is known to the rest of the grid will change. The new vomses entry would have to be propagated to clients before those clients will be able to contact the new Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server. Is this acceptable?

Generating the new, correct entry will be part of the installation, so getting it is easy. And I think OSG has a mechanism to propagate vomses entries, but I'm not sure how it works. We'd really like to get away from using a copy of the host certificate, but if the pain of using service certificates is too great, then we will reconsider.

Finally, what will the VDT do if there is no HTTP service certificate at installation time? We'd try to follow the pattern we use elsewhere: Configure Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS as best as we can and put messages in the post-install/README file explaining that the service certificate must be in place before the Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server will run.

Send us your comments, concerns, and questions, and we'll try to address them here.
