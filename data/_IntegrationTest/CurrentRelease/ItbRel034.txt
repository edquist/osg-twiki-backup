---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.3.4, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). It is based on [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.9/index.html][VDT 1.3.9a]]. There are two deployment options - a fully web services based installation, and one which installs the pre-web services Globus 4.0 which is important to many VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's for backwards compatiblity and migration.  

   * See previous release description for historical issues: ItbRel031.

---++ Validation and Work Plan
Descriptions of validation exercises of both applications and services using ITB release 0.3.4.  
  
   * The ITB "homepage" for the current release is IntegrationTestbed.  (*Site admins: go here to register your site.*)
   * OSGCEInstallGuide is the working set of instructions.
   * Descriptions of validations of the ITB 0.3 series of testbeds are located at the * ValidationPage. *


---++Known Issues and Problems
<b>Please put your name and the date next to your item. %GREEN%Green%ENDCOLOR% items are thought to be corrected. Also include a resolution or work-around (if available) with you name and date.</b>

---+++For Documentation
The following documentation twiki's need to be reviewed:

   * OSGCEInstallGuide (for site admins)
   * LocalStorageRequirements (general reference)
   * LocalStorageConfiguration (for site admnistrators)
   * LocalStorageUse (for users)

---+++For CE Installations
   * Main.JohnWeigand (01/11/06): <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=user&pass=guest&q=1395">VDT ticket 1395</a><br>   The VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/gridftp.log does not contain the transfer statistics that !MonALISA, ACDC and !GridCat are expecting.  It contains only informational messages.  Review the VDT support ticket references earlier for a better description.<br><b>Resolution:</b>  This will be fixed in VDT 1.3.10 and the OSG patch will be removed.<br><b>Work-around:</b>  Resolved in ITB 0.3.4 and OSG 0.4.0 at 1/11/06 15:00 CST. <br>If you are installing after that time, you will be fine.<br>If you have already installed from ITB 0.3.4 or from OSG 0.4.0 prior to 01/11/06 15:00 CST, you can install a pacman cache that will fix the problem.
       <pre>
          cd  YOUR_PACMAN_DIRECTORY  (version 3.15+)
           source setup.(c)sh
           cd YOUR_VDT_LOCATION
           then either:
              ITB:  pacman -get  iVDGL:gridftp-log
              OSG: pacman -get OSG:gridftp-log
        </pre>
      

---+++For VDT 

   * Known problems in VDT 1.3.9, [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.9/problems.html][here]]

---+++ For GUMS
   * Main.JohnWeigand (12/29/05):  There is a compatibility issue if you are planning on upgrading your GUMS server to VDT 1.3.9a (GUMS 1.1 server) and you are running a VDT 1.3.6 (GUMS 1.0 client) CE nodes.  This issue affects those running in Privilege and Compatiblity authorization modes, that is, if you are using PRIMA to authorize or just generating your grid-mapfile/grid3-user-vo-map.txt file from GUMS.  There is no problem with a VDT 1.3.9a (GUMS 1.1 client) CE node talking to a VDT 1.3.6 (GUMS 1.0 server).<p>The problem only occurs when converting the gums.config to use the  new !CertificateHostGroup class is used in the !hostGroup element of the gums.config.  This class uses the 'cn' attribute and is recommended for GUMS 1.1 servers. If you use the !WildCardHostGroup class with the 'wildcard' attribute you will have no problem.  However, that class has been deprecated and will not necessarily be supported in the future.<p>The error you will see for this compatibility condition is "The host (!YOUR_CE_NODE_hostname) is not defined in any group"  or "No map was found for the host (!YOUR_CE_NODE_hostname)".


---+++ For !MonALISA


---+++ For !GridCat

   If you are a new ITB site, don't forget to follow instructions on the IntegrationTestbed twiki web for
registering your site.


---+++ For GIP

Please discuss with Main.AnandPadmanabhan validation for GIP (see further GenericInformationProviders).

---+++ For Storage Issues


---+++ For OSG Attributes


---+++For !MDS/GRIS
   * Main.JohnWeigand (12/1/05): In the /etc/init.d/gris start script, the  check that the startup is successful (check of $?) will never work.  The 'su' is the only comand that will return a failure.  To verify success/failure, you need to 'ps' and 'grep' for grid_info_daemon.
   * Main.HorstSeverini (12/1/05): Why does 'ldapsearch -x' (anonymous bind) still work? I thought we decided back in February at the first OSG integration meeting that we were going to turn that off and only allow authenticated access?


---+++ For !GridEx


---++ OSG Compute Element (CE) Description
The OSG CE installation has two paths with this version.  ITB cache contents may be inspected [[http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/][here]].

| *Pre-Web Services* |  *Web Services* |
| osg-0.3.4 | osg-0.3.4-ws |


These packages deliver the following components (If you want both, install osg-0.3.4 first, then in the same install directory install 0.3.4-ws. Detailed instructions should be in OSGCEInstallGuide):
 
|  *Pre-Web Services* | *Web Services* | *Description* |
|  osg-auto-1.3.9  | osg-auto-1.3.9.-ws | provides a VDT questions setup, osg-version |
|  VDT_139   |  VDT_139-ws  | components from the VDT 1.3.9a package |
|  grid3-schema  || Grid3 Schema for GRIS |
|  osg-grid3-info-prov  || configure-osg and grid3 information files |
|  OSG:vo-0.2.1  || OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's |
|  OSG:gums:cron  || Fix for Client Gums installation |
|  srm-cp  || SRM client tool |
|  MIS-CI  || Monitoring interface |
|  osg-gip  || Generic information provider |
|  site-verify  || Site Verification |


---++ OSG Client 

There is a package of client tools available separately:

=pacman -get iVDGL:osg-client=

At the moment this is just VDT-Client (Condor-G, VDS, etc) from the current release of VDT.  We keep this as
a distinct package in case we need to add something in between VDT releases or tools perhaps not included 
in VDT.

---++ OSG Worker Node Client

This package is to be visible to worker nodes - either installed on the local disk, or through a NFS filesystem mount.

   * Twiki page with description: WorkerNodeClient


---++ Core MIS
Description of the CoreMIS infrastructure to be used, MIS-CI Version 0.3.0.  The Core MIS will be configured by the configure_misci.sh script as a post installation step.


---++ Information Services

More information about the information services in this release are available here:

   * OsgInformationService Overview 
      * GLUESchema 1.2
      * GenericInformationProviders (GIP)
      * Grid3Schema
      * Grid3InformationProvider


---++ Privilege and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Services Infrastructure

Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release.  From before, the PRIMA callout for extended proxy certificates has been fixed to match the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS usage. Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization is supported too. 


---++ Discovery and Job Monitoring Services
   * DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.  This should be performed by anyone who wishes to run a local discovery service registry.  The Discovery service will be used to catalog the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and SRM servers on the OSG.
   * DiscoveryServicePublication instructions for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and DRM service providers.  This should be run by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server administrators in order to get their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service registered with the Discovery Service.
   * See VDT 1.3.9a


---++ Site Validation

The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the OSG pacman cache in this release.
