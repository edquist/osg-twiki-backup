---++Overview
This document is intended as an installation guide for site administrators responsible for OSG middleware installation and configuration. We also provide instructions for 
---++Supported Operating Systems
   * Red Hat 7.x
   * Red Hat 9.0
   * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
   * Fedora Core 3 
   * Debian Linux 3.1 (Sarge)

Installation may be successful with other Linux distributions, but they have not been tested by the maintainers of Pacman and the VDT.  Several "binary-compatible"
distributions such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.x (x=3,4) and Rocks 3.x (x>=1)
have been successfully installed by members of the OSG-ITB treating them 
as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 but no support is implied.
%RED% Can we add the right comment for Rocks? %ENDCOLOR%
