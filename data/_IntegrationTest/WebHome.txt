---+Introduction
---++Call for Contributions
The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG integration activities.
It is intended to be a resource available to (and editable by) OSG users. If you have a problem, trying using the 'Search' link at the top of the page, or by navigating through the general topics listed below. If you can't find any help, or if you work out a new tip you think worth sharing, then feel free to add to this Wiki.

The principle is simple though - click on the 'Edit' button at the bottom of this page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').

_Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!_ 

---++Integration Objectives and Scope
This OSG Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, and establishes a framework for releases. 

---+OSG Service Overview
Here we provide an overview and context for the major service components comprising the OSG integration testbed.
---++Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT)
---++VO Administrative Services
---++Monitoring and Information Services
---+++Core MIS
---+++Grid Cat
---+++Monalisa
---+++BDII and GLUE
---++Tests

---+ITB Releases
Here we describe the integration testbed releases.  An ITB release is defined as a set of functionalities that are provide by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), a _VO_ (VO specific services provided by that VO, such as a VOMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB. 

---++Release Descriptions
	* [[ItbRel013][ITB 0.1.3 description]]

---+Site Administrators 
---++ITB Participation
Here we write down some notes regarding how site administrators participate in the OSG ITB activity. It is expected that the level of effort will vary over the course of the activity with intense installation sessions followed by periods of relative calm.  This timing is driven by the availability and schedules of new services making their way into the OSG.  On average, 1/4 FTE is usually required for participation.

---++Installation Guide for Core Services
	* The [[OsgItbInstallation][quick installation]] guide provides the starting point for site administrators.
