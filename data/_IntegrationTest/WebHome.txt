---+Introduction

---++Integration Objectives and Scope
This OSG Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, and establishes a framework for releases. 

---++Call for Contributions
The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG integration activities.
It is intended to be a resource available to (and editable by) OSG users. If you have a problem, trying using the 'Search' link below.  The principle is simple though - click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of this page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').
_Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!_

---+OSG Service Overview
Here we provide an overview and context for the major service components comprising the OSG integration testbed.
---++Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT)
---++VO Administrative Services
The VO administrative services are being organized by the Privilege project.  For more
information, <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/">homepage</a>.
---+++GUMS
You can find everything about GUMS at: http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/. There is a quick installation guide at: http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html.  And here you can find links to releases and builds: http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/download.html. 
More information and discussion is available under the GMSforOSG topic.

---+++PRIMA
You can find documentation on how to activate the PRIMA Authorization module in VDT to query a GUMS Identity Mapping Service at:
https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege:
Title: "Activating the PRIMA Authorization Module in VDT 1.3.1".  Also on this site is a document with the URLs of two test  GUMS Servers that may be used for evaluation: Title: "GUMS Mapping Servers for ITB 0.1.0".

---++Monitoring and Information Services
---+++Core MIS
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (CoreMIS) is bing has been successfully deployed during the Integration test bed meeting and is now releasing MIS-CI version 0.2.0. The current version can be obtained from the Pacman 2 cache using: 

<verbatim> 
pacman –get http://www.ivdgl.org/MIS-CI:MIS-CI
</verbatim>

---+++Grid Cat
GridCat provides a catalog of site attribute information and results of validation tests.

---+++Monalisa
MonALISA provides a repository of time-sampled information from various sources.

---+++BDII and GLUE
Discussions regarding OSG-specific uses of BDII and issues of GLUE schema are availble at GlueOSG.

---+++Discovery Service 
The discovery service provides a registry for publishing and querying for grid services. It has similar functionality to a UDDI registry, but provides a more lightweight API, xmlrpc accessibility, and a much more dynamic and distributed architecture. Service publications can be performed at any instance of the discovery service, and the publication will be automatically broadcast to all other instances of the discovery service. This allows clients to locate services from any discovery service instance, regardless of where the initial service publication took place. 

	* Discussions for the JClarens-based discovery service are available here [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]].

---+ITB Releases
Here we describe the integration testbed releases.  An ITB release is defined as a set of functionalities that are provide by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), a _VO_ (VO specific services provided by that VO, such as a VOMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB. 

	* [[ItbRel014][ITB 0.1.4 description]]
	* [[ItbRel013][ITB 0.1.3 description]]

---+Site Administrators 
---++ITB Participation
Here we write down some notes regarding how site administrators participate in the OSG ITB activity. It is expected that the level of effort will vary over the course of the activity with intense installation sessions followed by periods of relative calm.  This timing is driven by the availability and schedules of new services making their way into the OSG.  On average, 1/4 FTE is usually required for participation.

---++Site Participation
Note from Ruth (5/24/05) which is a lightweight proposal for a testbed site registration procedure for ITB participants.  This serves two purposes – to let the operations team know some basic contact information, and to transmit certain information to GridCat informing the developer (Bockjoo) that a new site is to be added.

To register, please email the following  to igoc at ivdgl.org - copy/paste the text 
below in the body:

<verbatim>
Short_Site_Name
Host_Name
SystemAdmin email
System Admin phone
$app path name
$data path name
$tmp path name
$wntmp path name
</verbatim>
