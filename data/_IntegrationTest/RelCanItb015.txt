---+!!<nop> OSG Release Candidate Integration Workshop
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction
A face-to-face meeting of OSG integrators, VDT, a few hardy site administrators, and a documentarian for final integration of the OSG "release candidate" for mid-May deployment.  The focus of the meeting will be on functionality all services in the release candidate.  Note - this will likely be something like ITB 0.1.5, which we will define based on this week's experiences and developments.

**This meeting will be followed by a follow-up** to install on the remaining (available) ITB sites, and to perform validations of all kinds, especially by the applications and for any scalability tests.  

It is a goal of the workshop to hand over a Release Candidate to Provisioning.
