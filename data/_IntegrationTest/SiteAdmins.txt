---++ITB Participation
Here we write down some notes regarding how site administrators participate in the OSG ITB activity. It is expected that the level of effort will vary over the course of the activity with intense installation sessions followed by periods of relative calm.  This timing is driven by the availability and schedules of new services making their way into the OSG.  On average, 1/4 FTE is usually required for participation.

---++Site Registration
Note from Ruth (5/24/05) which is a lightweight proposal for a testbed site registration procedure for ITB participants.  This serves two purposes – to let the operations team know some basic contact information, and to transmit certain information to GridCat informing the developer (Bockjoo) that a new site is to be added.

To register, please email the following  to igoc at ivdgl.org - copy/paste the text 
below in the body:

<verbatim>
Short_Site_Name
Host_Name
SystemAdmin email
System Admin phone
$app path name
$data path name
$tmp path name
$wntmp path name
</verbatim>
