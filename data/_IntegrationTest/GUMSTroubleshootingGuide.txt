---+!!<nop>GUMS Troubleshooting Guide
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction
This document is intended to provide some assistance in troubleshooting  problems which may or may be related to GUMS.


---++Log files
When in doubt, this is the best place to find the problems in GUMS.

---+++VDT_LOCATION/gums/var/log
These logs cover the activities associated with the <b>gums</b> and <b>gums-host</b> processes.
	* gums-developer.[USER].log
	* gums-edg-security.[USER.log
	* gums-privilege.[USER]..log

Their location and information levels are controlled by the <b>VDT_LOCATION/gums/log4j.properties</b> file.

---+++VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v5/logs
These logs cover those activites using web services/ui.
	* gums-service-admin.log
	* gums-service-cybersecurity.log
	* gums-service-edg-security.log
	* gums-service-privilege.log

Their location and information levels are controlled by the <b>VDT_LOCATION/gums-service/var/war/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties</b> file.

---+++VDT_LOCATION/apache/logs
If  it does not look  like a request is getting through to GUMS, then the Apache log files are next.

---++Authorization Denied
This occurs if you have not added yourself to the <b>admins</b> group in GUMS and, generally you will see the following message:
	  <verbatim>
	  GUMS encountered an error
	  Error Type: gov.bnl.gums.admin.AuthorizationDeniedException
	  Error Message: Authorization denied
	  </verbatim>	

A couple of things to look for:
	* If you encounter this in your browser, verify you are using the correct certificate.
	* If from command line, verfiy you have a valid proxy (grid or voms) and it is for for the DN of the <b>admins</b>.
	* If you have access to the GUMS database in !MySql, execute the following query:
  <dd>select userDN from User where userGroup = 'admins'; </dd>

See the "[[GumsAdmins#Create_a_GUMS_administrator][Creating a GUMS adminstrator]]"  instructions if necessary.
