---+!!<nop>How to Install VOMS
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%
---++Introduction
The [[http://hep-project-grid-scg.web.cern.ch/hep-project-grid-scg/voms.html VOMS]] (Virtual Organization Membership Service) has three main parts: 
<OL>
<LI>A !MySql database which is a persistent repository for VO membership information, 
<LI>The VOMS Admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VO membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat-4.
<LI>The VOMS server, a daemon process which services the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests.
</OL>

Also  included in the installation is a VOMS client containing the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> for testing.

Here we describe how to install and configure VOMS on your Linux machine. When you install VOMS as described here, you get all three parts.  It comes with a test VO called VDT. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VO with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.

We also describe how to remove a VO from VOMS, and how to uninstall VOMS, should the need arise.

All the sample commands are shown with Bourne shell syntax.  Substitute appropriate values as needed.

---++Pre-requisites for VOMS  Installation

---+++Pacman
You will use pacman to install VOMS.  See the 
<a href="http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/PacmanInfo">Pacman guide</a>
 for download and installation instructions.

---+++Certificates
If you do not already have the necessary certificates on this host, this can  be done as a post-install step. Instructions for getting the certificate can be found at this 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/requesting_cert.html">VDT site</A>. 
		  Also refer to any instructions you may find in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/post-install/README that may be related to this.

<OL>
<LI><b>host certificate</b>: Used by the VOMS server.  The host certificate should be installed in /etc/grid-security with ownership and permissions as:
<pre>
	/etc/grid-security
	-rw-r--r--  1 root	root	 1176 Nov  7 16:38 hostcert.pem
	-r--------  1 root	root	  887 Nov  7 16:38 hostkey.pem
</pre> 

<p>
<LI><b>http certificate</b>: Used by apache.  The http certificate for your system should be installed in  /etc/grid-security/http with ownership and permission as:
<pre>
	/etc/grid-security
	-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1176 Nov  7 16:38 httpcert.pem
	-r--------  1 root root  887 Nov  7 16:38 httpkey.pem
</pre>
 If you do not already have one on this machine, this will have to be done as a post-install step. Instructions for getting the certificate can be found at this 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/requesting_cert.html">VDT site</A>. 
		  Also refer to any instructions you may find in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/post-install/README that may be related to this.
<p>
</OL>

---+++Known Problems
Review the "Known Problems" section of the ItbRel015 or ItbRel016 page depending on the version being installed.

---+++Previous installations
If you have an OSG VOMS running and you're about to reinstall or if any of the following daemons are installed and running on your machine, see the [[#ShutdownGuide][Shutdown instructions]] below. 


	 
---++What's  Getting Installed

---+++Software
These instructions are for  ITB 0.3.6 (VDT 1.3.10) release of VOMS which installs this software
<pre>
	 Apache HTTPD 2.2.0
	 CA Certificates v11 (includes IGTF 1.0 CAs)
	 EDG CRL Update 1.2.5
	 GPT 3.2
	 Java SDK 1.4.2_10
	 Logrotate 3.7
	 MySQL 4.1.11
	 Apache Tomcat 5.0.28
	 VOMS 1.6.10.2
	 VOMS Admin (client 1.2.10, interface 1.0.2, server 1.2.10) 1.2.10-r0
</pre>

---+++Service - /etc/init.d
The services installed and activated are:
<pre>
  <b>/etc/init.d</b>
	  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  1684 Feb 21 23:02 edg-crl-upgraded
	  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  6591 Feb 21 23:02 mysql
	  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4039 Feb 21 23:03 apache 
	  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  3289 Feb 21 23:03 tomcat-5
	  -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  8890 Feb 22 09:24 voms
</pre>

In addition, during the installation, a test VO called 'VDT' will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the 'VDT' VO will have to be performed separately.

Note: The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> client in previous releases of VDT (1.3.2 and below) may be incompatible with this release.	If this is of concern to you, you will have to run both an older and a newer VOMS to retain compatibility with the older versions of <i>edg-mkgridmap</i>..

VDT 1.3.10 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

	  http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.3.10

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n]  <b><i>y</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------
	 :
The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?
Choices:
		  r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
				(existing CA files will be preserved)
		  l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
		  n (no)	 - do not install
<b><i>r</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------	

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.
Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?
Possible Answers:
	  y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
		  this one..
	  n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
		  run this one.
	  s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
		  there is already an instance running, leave it alone.
<b><i>y</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------

If you would like, we can configure VOMS to start automatically at boot time.

Configuring the VOMS daemon requires
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMS server to run automatically?

Possible Answers:
	  y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
		  this one..
	  n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
		  run this one.
	  s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
		  there is already an instance running, leave it alone.
 
	<b><i>y</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------

Do you want the EDG CRL update daemon to be run automatically when
your computer starts up? If so, we will install one file,
edg-crl-updated, into etc/rc.d/init.d/.

It will periodically update the Europen DataGrid (EDG) certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) It is essential if you are collaborating with
people from the EDG, and not important if you are not.

</pre>
The above line should be the last line of output you see.  The version number of the tarball may be different 
than that shown above.  Do not be concerned with this.

---+++Verify the  installation completed successfully
To verify  the pacman installation was successful, there should be a setup.(c)sh in the VDT_LOCATION.	If present, source it.
<pre>
	&gt  cd $VDT_LOCATION
	&gt  source setup.sh
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> This does not necessarily indicated that everything was installed and configured successfully.  It just verifies that the pacman installation completed successfully.  There is a lot of other magic that occurs during the process that should be validated.



---++Verifying the Success of the Installation
If all the required certificates were in place prior to the pacman installation, a default VO called <i>VDT</i> has been created already and all the deamon services should be up and running.
This section will take you through the steps necessary to verify that and can also serve as a basic operational trouble shooting guide.

If the certificates were installed <b>after</b> the pacman installation, then you should go to the next section (<a href="#Creating_a_new_VO">Creating a new VO</a>)  and create a <i>VDT</i> VO for test/play purposes.  Then return here to varify the configuration.

For  all the verifications, you will need to source the VDT setup.(c)sh script:
<pre>
	&gt  cd &lt VDT_LOCATION &gt
	&gt  source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++Verifying  the edg-crl-upgrade daemon
The edg-crl-upgrade daemon  (essential if you are collaborating with EDG people) updates the certificate revocation lists on a daily (default) basis.
<pre>
	<b>/etc/init.d</b>
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  1684 Feb 21 23:02 edg-crl-upgraded
</pre>
To verify it is running:
<pre>
	&gt	ps -efwww |  grep edg-crl-upgrade
	root  13268  1  0 Feb21 ?	00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/local/osg/edg/sbin/edg-crl-upgrade
</pre>
To verify it created the crl files:
<pre>
	&gt	ls -l  $X509_CADIR/*.r0
	-rw-r--r--  1 root root  61312 Feb 22 10:48 /usr/local/osg/globus/TRUSTED_CA/01621954.r0
	-rw-r--r--  1 root root	7657 Feb 22 10:48 /usr/local/osg/globus/TRUSTED_CA/03aa0ecb.r0
	-rw-r--r--  1 root root	1868 Feb 22 10:48 /usr/local/osg/globus/TRUSTED_CA/1149214e.r0
		 :  
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> The number of crl files does not directly correlate to the number of CAs, 
			 but there should be at least 1 and they should never be more than a day old
			  unless you've change the default interval.

---+++Verifying  the apache/tomcat daemon
Apache and Tomcat are used to access the WEB user interface of  VOMS. 
<pre>
	<b>/etc/init.d</b>
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 4039 Feb 21 23:03 apache
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 3289 Feb 21 23:03 tomcat-5
</pre>
To verify they are running:
<pre>
	&gt	ps -efwww |  grep  apache
	 <b>apache</b>	 2585 10881  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd
		<b> (there will be a number of these)</b>
			 :
	 root		8924	  1  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:03 /usr/local/osg/<b>apache</b>/bin/httpd -d /usr/local/osg/<a>apache</b> -k start -f

	 daemon	15165  8924  0 09:24 ?		  00:00:00 /usr/local/osg/<b>apache</b>/bin/httpd 
			<b>(and a number of these)</b>


	&gt	ps -efwww |  grep tomcat
	daemon	15238	  1  0 09:24 pts/2	 00:00:15 /usr/local/osg/jdk1.4/bin/java	  
	-Djava.endorsed.dirs=/usr/local/osg/<b>tomcat</b>/v5/common/endorsed
	-classpath	 /usr/local/osg/jdk1.4/lib/tools.jar:/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5/bin/commons-logging-api.jar 
	-Dcatalina.base=/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5 -Dcatalina.home=/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5		
	-Djava.io.tmpdir=/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5/temp org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  There should be only one tomcat process running with <i>init (pid=1)</i> as it's parent.


To verify they are working correctly with VOMS:
<OL>
	<LI>Point a certificate-enabled browser window to <i>https://<b>your.host.name</b>:8443/edg-voms-admin/VDT</i>
</OL>

---+++Verifying Your VOMS VO Is Functional

---+++Check VOMS-Admin
After this completes, the EDG-VOMS-Admin should be running for the VDT VO; point a certificate-enabled browser window to https://your.host.name:8443/edg-voms-admin/VDT.  You won't be able to do anything with it yet since you're not added as a user, but verify that it comes up. Click "Administrate VOMS" -- you should get "Access Denied".
#AddUserAsAdmin
---+++Add a user as Admin
Add yourself or someone else as the VO-Admin for the VO VDT;
you will need the personal certificate file to do this.
Set the certfile variable to the path for the cert file (an example is shown), and run the command:
<verbatim>
	 certfile=~weigand/.globus/usercert.pem 
	 $EDG_LOCATION/sbin/edg-voms-admin-local VDT --add-admin $certfile 
</verbatim>
(No output indicates success.)
---+++Test VOMS-Admin again
You should now be able to go up in your browser and navigate through the various menus without getting an "Access Denied" message. Do not add anyone else until you test the voms-proxy-init command.

---+++Secure your server
By default, edg-voms-admin-local can be run by any local user.  To secure this feature,
<verbatim>
	 $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_apache --secure
	 /sbin/service apache restart
</verbatim>
To enable it again, run the above commands without the --secure option.

---+++Test voms-proxy-init
In order for a client voms-proxy-init to access the VO's server, you
need a configuration file available to tell it which voms server to access. The config file is found here:
<verbatim>
VO=VDT
cp $EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin/${VO}/vomses $EDG_LOCATION/etc/vomses/${VO}
</verbatim>

As yourself, get a voms proxy; shown here for VO VDT and attribute /VDT:
<verbatim>
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
voms-proxy-init --voms=VDT:/VDT
</verbatim>

Output 
<verbatim>
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase:

Contacting  cd-94372.dhcp.fnal.gov:15007 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cd-94372.dhcp.fnal.gov] "VDT" Done
Creating proxy ........................................................... Done
Your proxy is valid until Wed May 11 04:31:06 2005
</verbatim>

End of output

Verify that you got a proxy with the attribute requested.	 
Note the 'attribute' line below specifying the group requested.
<verbatim>
voms-proxy-info --all
</verbatim>
Output
<verbatim>

Now try one for a group you do not belong to, e.g., /MyGroup
<verbatim>

Warning: VDT: Unable to satisfy G/MyGroup Request! Error: VERR_SERVERCODE Failed.
Failed to contact servers for VDT.
</verbatim>
End of output

Note the misleading message saying you "Failed to contact servers for VDT."
This is not true.
The key to the real error is in "Warning: VDT: Unable to satisfy G/MyGroup Request!" which has your request embedded in it. 

Also note that if you do a voms-proxy-init immediately after the failure, your 
previous is proxy is still valid.

---++Creating a new VO
You won't be able to use the default VO named VDT (the VO name must be unique). You'll have to create a new one (or any number of new ones).
---+++What to expect and what you need to know
When you create a new VO, many things occur. In particular, a database and several files are created, and you need to know what they're used for. CreateNewVoForVomsInfo lists and describes these things.
---+++Before creating the VO
Define the following series of environment variables representing the arguments used on the install command line.  Note: the syntax used for defining this data is in Bourne shell format.  Depending on whether you need to change the value, you may be able to just cut/paste a lot of these
		commands during the installation process.  
		
	 VO=Test	<br />	  
		The name of your VO (shown as Test).  Mixed case is permissable. 
		This will also be the top level (root) group for the VO.

	 PORT=15007	 <br />
		Port number the voms server listens on for voms-proxy-init requests.
		Each VO has a unique instance of the voms server running and listening on a port.

	 SMTP_HOST=smtp.fnal.gov	<br />
		The hostname of the SMTP delivery service at the site of this VOMS server.
		The host must accept emails for delivery.

	 MAIL_FROM=your-email-address <br />
		The sender email address for the notification messages sent by this VOMS service.
		This should be a read address otherwise the failure notifications will end up in 
		/dev/null.

	 PASSWORD=some-unique-password  <br />
		The password of this VO's voms database users mentioned above ($VO_adm, $VO_que, $VO_seq and $VO_upd).
		Please change ffomr what is shown above!

	 VOMS_GROUP=daemon <br />
		The Unix group name of the user the VOMS server runs under. 
		The default with VDT installations is 'daemon'.  

	 TOMCAT_GROUP=daemon <br />
		The Unix group name of the user that tomcat4 runs under. 
		The default with VDT installations is 'daemon'.  

	 CERTDIR=$GLOBUS_PATH/TRUSTED_CA <br />
		Not sure if this has any affect as it does not appear to be picking up
		all the CAs in this directory.  Actually, this is a link and this may
		be the problem.%RED%John -- what was the problem? AH 6/2%ENDCOLOR%

You need to know your root password for the mysql database, if you have one.  If you don't, you don't need one.
If you want to set the root password:
<verbatim>
	  $VDT_LOCATION/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
	  $VDT_LOCATION/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h $(hostname) password 'new-password'
</verbatim>
The VDT setup script should set the EDG_LOCATION variable needed by VOMS
if it is installed there. (Check to be sure; it should be set to $VDT_LOCATION/voms.)

---+++Execute the script to create the VO

Execute the $EDG_LOCATION/edg-voms-admin-configure script with the 'install' argument and
the required set of parameters shown below (and described above). This will create a set of sql files containing the ddl and initial data for 
  the VOMS database for your VO. It will create the directories and data files for the VO. If you've set all the variables, you should be able to just cut and paste.

<verbatim> 
  $EDG_LOCATION/sbin/edg-voms-admin-configure install \
		--port			 $PORT \
		--vo				$VO \
		--voalias		 $VO \
		--mail-from	  $MAIL_FROM \
		--smtp-host	  $SMTP_HOST \
		--password		$PASSWORD  \
		--voms-group	 $VOMS_GROUP \
		--tomcat-group  $TOMCAT_GROUP \
		--certdir		 $CERTDIR
</verbatim>

These listed warnings will be processed in the next step.

The file system directories and files have been created as mentioned in the beginning.
You can view their contents:
<verbatim>
  ls -l $EDG_LOCATION/etc/voms
  ls -l $EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin
 (Ignore this last one for now) ls -l $EDG_LOCATION/etc/vomses/$VO
</verbatim>
(These are links; see  <tt>/data/osg-itb-016/vdt-app-data/voms/voms</tt> and <tt>/data/osg-itb-016/vdt-app-data/voms/voms-admin</tt>.)

---++ Create the VOMS database for the VO

The voms database for a VO is created in mysql as 'voms_$VO' (e.g., voms_TEST1)

To create it, we need to run the following series of commands (notice they're run as the mysql root user):
<verbatim>
  cd $EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin/$VO
  mysql -uroot < install-voms-1-mysql-as-root.sql
  mysql -uroot voms_$VO < install-voms-2-mysql-as-root.sql
  mysql -uroot voms_$VO < install-voms-3-mysql-as-root.sql
  mysql -uroot voms_$VO < install-voms-4-mysql-as-root.sql
</verbatim>
No output indicates success; any output needs to be reconciled.
If all was successful, you should have a voms database for the VO.
You can view this if you go into the mysql database.

---++Get Tomcat Up and Running

Tomcat still does not know about the VO, however. For Tomcat to know about the VO, 
the edg-voms-admin-$VO.xml file must be moved to $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v4/webapps. 
This xml configuration file provides the context for the VO within Tomcat.
<verbatim>
cd $EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin/$VO
cp -p edg-voms-admin-$VO.xml $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v4/webapps/.
</verbatim>
First stop tomcat-4 if you have it running:
<verbatim>
/etc/init.d/tomcat-4 stop
</verbatim>
output (the path shown in the output is $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat):
<verbatim>
Using CATALINA_BASE:	/data/osg-itb-015/tomcat/v4
Using CATALINA_HOME:	/data/osg-itb-015/tomcat/v4
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /data/osg-itb-015/tomcat/v4/temp
Using JAVA_HOME:		 /data/osg-itb-015/jdk1.4
</verbatim>

Restart tomcat-4:
<verbatim>
/etc/init.d/tomcat-4 start
</verbatim>
output(the path shown in the output is $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat):
<verbatim>
Using CATALINA_BASE:	/data/osg-itb-015/tomcat/v4
Using CATALINA_HOME:	/data/osg-itb-015/tomcat/v4
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /data/osg-itb-015/tomcat/v4/temp
Using JAVA_HOME:		 /data/osg-itb-015/jdk1.4
</verbatim>

---+++Bring up the VOMS-Admin Web UI
Bring up a browser with your personal certificate in it and access the VOMS UI
for your newly created VO. 
The URL is https://your.host.name:8443/edg-voms-admin/{your_VO_name}

You won't be able to do anything in it yet.  Return to the <a href="#AddUserAsAdmin">"Add a user as Admin"</a> section
to progress further.
 
The command below shows a different way to add an admin, and also should allow you to assign
a role, but is failing with a relocation error on sn ssl library in perl.
<verbatim>
	  $EDG_LOCATION/sbin/edg-voms-admin \
				 --url=http://$(hostname):8080/edg-voms-admin/${VO} \
			create-user \
				$certfile \
			assign-role \
				${VO} \
				VO-Admin \
				$certfile 
</verbatim>
---++Start the VOMS server for the VO
Make sure you're root. Run:
<verbatim>
$EDG_LOCATION/etc/init.d/voms start $VO
</verbatim>
Output (showing the VO name; yours will be different):
<verbatim>
Starting edg-voms(TEST1):											 [  OK  ]
</verbatim>
Verify the VOMS server is running:
<verbatim>
$EDG_LOCATION/etc/init.d/voms status $VO
</verbatim>
output (showing the VO name; yours will be different):
<verbatim>
Status edg-voms(Test3): (pid 7715) is running...
</verbatim>
---++Set the Global ACL for list access to each Group
(moved here from VoAdmins page, and lightly edited; needs more clarification by author. AH)

We suggest that you set the global ACL on the web UI to allow access to anyone who presents a valid certificate issued by a known CA.  The following procedure will allow any valid certificate to query the server:
	* Go to the web UI (with a browser with the certificate you use as admin)<br>
		 - https://[YOUR_VOMS_HOST]:8443/edg-voms-admin/[YOUR_VO]
	* Select <b>Administrate VOMS</b> under the <b>Adminstration</b> menu item from the left panel
	* Select <b>Global ACL</b> from the left panel
	* Press <b>Edit this ACL</b>
	* - From the <b>Allow:</b> pull down, select "<b>Allow</b>" <br>
		- From the <b>Operation</b> pull down, select "<b>list</b>".<br>
		  <b>NOTE:</b> Be sure to select "list", default is "all".	You do NOT want "all".<br>
		- From the <b>For</b> selection, select  "<b>Anyone who presents a certificate issued by a known CA</b>"<br>
		- Press "Add new entry"<br>
		- NOTE: If you already have this entry in the list of ACL's you did not need to do this.

Note that this will allow newly-added services to provide access to members of your VO without you specifically adding them to the list of machines allowed to access your list of users (I don't follow this sentence. AH).  To gain access to the member list, such a machine or service (or person) will have to present a valid grid certificate.

Warning:

  At present, there is no way to prevent the harvesting of such a list of users for a potential spoofing attack that would use such a list of users to present a false service on the grid.  To create such an exploit, someone with a valid grid certificate would have to pretend to offer a service that would imitate one that would be discovered by an automatic discovery service.  By having a list of valid users, such a theoretical imitation service could accept jobs and divert them to other purposes.  VO's that are sensitive to the possibility of such a "discovery service" attack and who do not have methods of validating the list of offered services for users should not set the Global ACL as above, and will therefore have to fall back to entering each machine or service on the grid manually that they want to allow access to their list of users.

---++ Test access to your VOMS from a gatekeeper with simple grid-mapfile
(taken from 
"Ye olde grid3 mode" -- and adapted)

Your VO maintains a secure membership
service which may be queried on a gatekeeper node with the utility
<verbatim>
$VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
</verbatim>
To create a <b>grid-mapfile</b> containing an entry for every
member of the VO (probably just yourself, at this stage), first you need to copy and start the <b>edg-gridmapfile-upgraded</b> daemon. (If the ITB is already installed, a file of this name will already be in place.)
<pre> 
	 cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded /etc/init.d/
	 /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded start
</pre>

Now, su/ssh to root so that the host certificate can be used.

 The gatekeeper should test the <b>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap</b> script to ensure
there are no connection errors to your VOMS services. First, make a short conf file with just the users known to your VO.
The default conf file is
<pre>
$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf
</pre>
Make yours in the same directory. It can just have one line:
<pre>
group vomss://{your voms host}:8443/edg-voms-admin/{your VO name} {account name}
</pre>
E.g.,
<pre>
group vomss://cd-94372.dhcp.fnal.gov:8443/edg-voms-admin/Test3 aheavey
</pre>
Now, run edg-mkgridmap. The --output argument specifies the grid-mapfile name (e.g., test.out); it is NOT optional. The --conf argument specifies the conf file, e.g., my.conf.
<pre>
  cd $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin
  ./edg-mkgridmap --verbose --conf=my.conf --output=test.out
</pre>
Check your output file (shown here as test.out).  It should contain the DN of each member you've added to the VO.  If it does, it worked!


  The most common error is "Internal Server Error" which indicates an
  authentication failure.  This can happen either because access to the
  VOMS DB has not been completed, or because the local site credentials
  (host certificate and key) are not valid.  If this occurs, set the X509_USER_CERT and
  X509_USER_KEY variables to test using a different, valid certificate
  and key.

---++Add users, groups, and roles to your VOMS installation

Go to your VOMS web UI, click Adminstrate VOMS.  Use the Users, Groups and Roles links to add these items.


---++Remove a VO from your VOMS Database
First su/ssh to root.

You need to know your root password for the mysql database, if it exists.
If you did not set a root password, leave dbpasswd empty
If you want to set the root password:
<verbatim>
	 VDT_LOCATION/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
	 VDT_LOCATION/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h $(hostname) password 'new-password'
</verbatim>
Set your environment:
<verbatim>
VDT_LOCATION=/data/osg-itb-015
cd $VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
</verbatim>
Change the VO variable to the VO you want to remove.
<verbatim>
VO=your_vo_name
</verbatim>
Stop the VOMS server for the VO
<verbatim>
$EDG_LOCATION/etc/init.d/voms stop $VO
</verbatim>
Stop tomcat, remove the VO context file from the /var/tomcat4/webapps directory, and retart tomcat:
<verbatim>
/etc/init.d/tomcat-4 stop
rm -f $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v4/webapps/edg-voms-admin-$VO.xml 
/etc/init.d/tomcat-4 start
</verbatim>

This script creates a sql file for cleaning up the database
This file needs to use the mysql script as mysql root.
<verbatim>
$EDG_LOCATION/sbin/edg-voms-admin-configure remove \
  --vo				$VO \
  --voms-group	 $VOMS_GROUP  \
  --tomcat-group  $TOMCAT_GROUP 
</verbatim>

Remove the database and users from the mysql database
<verbatim>
sqlfile=$EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin/${VO}/remove-voms-mysql-as-root.sql
</verbatim>

NOTE: you can remove the $DBA_PSWD (mysql root password) from the command and 
enter it at the command line prompt which is more secure:
<verbatim>
mysql -u root -p$DBA_PSWD <$sqlfile
mysql -u root <$sqlfile
</verbatim>

Check:
<verbatim>
ls -l $EDG_LOCATION/etc/voms
ls -l $EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin
ls -l $EDG_LOCATION/etc/vomses/$VO
</verbatim>
Remove the following:
	* the voms server configuration directory
	* the tomcat configuration directory
	* the vomses file in the ./vomses directroy for client access
<verbatim>
rm -rf $EDG_LOCATION/var/etc/edg-voms-admin/$VO  ## tomcat configs
rm -f  $EDG_LOCATION/etc/vomses/$VO				  ## vomses file 
</verbatim>
Done!

#ShutdownGuide
The OSG VOMS starts up several processes.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG VOMS without shutting them down it will fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG VOMS services before upgrading:

<ul>
  <li>/etc/ini.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/apache stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/tomcat-5  stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/voms stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/mysql stop
</ul>
