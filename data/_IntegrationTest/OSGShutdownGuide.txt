---++Stopping the currently running daemons

The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down it will fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading:

<ul>
  <li>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/gris stop
  <li>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/ML_SER stop
</ul>
