---++Stopping the currently running daemons

The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down it will fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading:

<ul>
  <li>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/gris stop
  <li>$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/ML_SER stop  
  # (has to be done as either monalisa or daemon user depending on how MonALISA was configured by the VDT)
  <li> if running personal condor from the default VDT install, stop that too.
</ul>

<p>Example session from doing this shutdown:</p>
<pre>
[root@mysite root]# /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
Stopping edg-crl-upgrade
[root@mysite root]# /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
Stopping edg-gridmapfile-upgrade: 
[root@mysite root]# /etc/init.d/gris stop
[root@mysite root]# su -s /bin/sh - monalisa
[monalisa@mysite monalisa]$ . /usr/local/grid/setup.sh
[monalisa@mysite monalisa]$ $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/ML_SER stop
Trying to stop MonaLisa ....STOPPED
Trying to stop emysqldb...OK
</pre>
Replace "monalisa" with "daemon" above in the su command if you have no monalisa user.

Check also to see whether there are any stray OSG-related processes, such as run-mis-ci.sh and so forth still running, and kill them manually if necessary.  You may also want to log in to the account running your MIS-CI accounting and remove its crontab by typing "crontab -r" to prevent monitoring updates while you are doing the installation.
