---+!!<nop>OSG Shutdown Guide
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++What processes need to be stopped?

The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down, it may fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading (see sample shutdown session below):

<verbatim>
/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
/etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
/etc/init.d/gris stop
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh
/etc/init.d/MLD stop or $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Services/CMD/MLD stop
</verbatim>

Bear in mind that MonALISA also uses a database backend.  Here is how to find out whether MonALISA is running, and if so, under what user:

=ps -efwww | grep -i monalisa=

and for the mysql or postgres daemons associated with MonALISA, check using:

=ps -efwww | grep -i mysql=

or

=ps -efwww  | grep -i post[master,gres]=

If you are running a Rocks cluster, be sure to kill only the OSG-related mysql processes and avoid inadvertently stopping any cluster-related ones.  In general, pay attention if you need to kill any database-related processes explicitly; for example, look to make sure they are related to MonALISA and/or are running out of your VDT installation area before stopping them.

If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you should
remove the =/etc/init.d/MLD= link if it exists, as this will link to the =ML_SER= in your old =$VDT_LOCATION=.

If you're running a personal condor from the default VDT install:

=/etc/init.d/condor stop=

If your site is running the webservice enabled Globus, then you will also need to run the following to shut down the Globus webservice container:

=/etc/init.d/globus-ws stop=

Ensure that you've disabled the Globus Gatekeeper and GridFTP from inetd or xinetd.  If you are using xinetd, you can do

=chkconfig globus-gatekeeper off= <br>
=chkconfig gsiftp off= 

(if you do not have chkconfig, edit /etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper and /etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp, and set disable = yes.)
If you are using inetd, then edit inetd.conf, and comment out the lines for globus-gatekeeper and gridftp.  Lastly, restart xinetd and inetd by:

=/etc/init.d/xinetd restart=

or

=/etc/init.d/inetd restart=



---++Sample Shutdown Session
Here is a sample session for doing the shutdown. 
Notes:
   * In the *su* line, replace "monalisa" with "daemon" if you have no monalisa user.
   * In the setup.sh line, the path =/usr/local/grid= represents =$VDT_LOCATION=.
<pre>
 # /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
Stopping edg-crl-upgrade
 # /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop
Stopping edg-gridmapfile-upgrade: 
 # /etc/init.d/gris stop
 # . /usr/local/grid/setup.sh
 # $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh
      There is(are)       1 crontab(s): 
      /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/tmp/misci/crontab_ivdgl
00 * * * * /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh >& /dev/null 
10 * * * * /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh >& /dev/null 
20 * * * * /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh >& /dev/null 
30 * * * * /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh >& /dev/null 
40 * * * * /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh >& /dev/null 
50 * * * * /usr/local/grid/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh >& /dev/null 
      Uninstalling crontab entry for MISCI run by user ivdgl
      Removing crontab
 # /etc/init.d/MLD stop
Trying to stop MonaLisa ....STOPPED
Trying to stop emysqldb...OK
 # /etc/init.d/globus-ws stop
Stopping Globus container. PID: 26466
Container stopped
</pre>

Also check to see whether there are any stray OSG-related processes, such as run-mis-ci.sh, globus-job-manager, and so forth still running, and kill them manually if necessary.  

---++If VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and/or GUMS is Running on Machine

The process involves bringing down the tomcat servlet container, the included apache distribution, and mysql server.

<pre>
 # /etc/init.d/tomcat-5 stop
 # /etc/init.d/apache stop
 # /etc/init.d/mysql stop
</pre>
