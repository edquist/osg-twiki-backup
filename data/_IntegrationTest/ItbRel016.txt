%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.1.6, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). We expect this release will be likely picked up by the OSG Provisioning Activity for large scale deployment (at least we hope so).
	* Guides for site and VO administrators are provided below. 
	* This release of the ITB will incorporate major changes in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/%OSG_ITB_VDT_CACHE6%/index.html][VDT %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION6%]]
	* VO services should be registered using the [[ItbVo][VO registration]] procedure.
	* A new MIS-CI release, version 0.2.6RC2, is included,
	* Generic Information Providers (GIP) from LCG

---+++!! Release version indicator
We are tracking non-critical updates using a "-Number" release designation.  On a resource the output of the command 
<verbatim> 
$ $VDT_LOCATION/osg-version 
</verbatim> 
	is used to indicate the specific version of OSG installed.

---+++PRIMA Authorization (PRIMA-GUMS-VOMS) Issues

	* Service/host  (e.g.  CN of certificate is CN=service/host.site.com)  problem in PRIMA/GUMS.  See ([[ServiceHostCertGumsProblem]] ) for details.<br>
	  <b>Work Around:</b> %GREEN%In the wildcard attribute of the hostGroup element of the gums.config file, force GUMS to match  on the service part of the DN. In the example, below, this is the word 'host'.  The caveat here is that any gatekeeper node requesting authorization will be allowed access. <br>
	  e.g.  wildcard="*.fnal.gov,host", will match on all fnal.gov requests and any from 'host'.<br>
	  (Main.GabrieleCarcassi - 4/29/2005)<br>%ENDCOLOR%
		<b>Resolution:</b> Will be fixed in GUMS 1.1.0, which will be in VDT 1.3.7 - per Gabriele Carcassi%ENDCOLOR%<br>
		(Main.JohnWeigand - 5/31/05)

	* VOs and subgroups containing an underscore character (e.g. ppd_theory) are not being 
		 accepted by GUMS.  The problem was identified  when GUMS was retrieving members
		 for a VO called ppd_astro. (Main.JohnWeigand - 6/1/05) <br>
		 <b>Work-around: </b> %GREEN%The only site currently using underscore in the VO name/group are in the fermigrid environment and they have agreed to change the names.  Consistency in validation of all elements of an FQAN (VO/group/subgroup/role) across VOMRS/VOMS/GUMS is still required to fully resolve the issue.%ENDCOLOR% Main.JohnWeigand - 03 Jun 2005<br>
		 <b>Resolution: </b> Still under review by Gabriele Carcassi.<br>
		  <b>Symptom:</b>The retrieval from the VOMS server for the ppd_astro vo was 
		 successful, but GUMS failed to update its database with the following error in the 
		  gums-service-admin.log:
			<verbatim>
31 May 2005 21:02:34,268 [WARN ]: VOMSGroup:
	 https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/edg-voms-admin/ppd_astro/services/VOMSAdmin - 
	 voGroup='/ppd_astro' - voRole='null' - sslCAFiles='null' 
	 sslCertfile='/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem' 
	 sslKey='/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem' 
	 sslKeyPasswd=[not set] wasn't updated successfully: 
	 Couldn't retrieve users from VOMS server: FQAN '/ppd_astro' is malformed 
		(syntax: /VO[/group[/subgroup(s)]][/Role=role][/Capability=cap])]
			</verbatim>

	* %BLACK% Need policy instructions on minimal GUMS config (Steve Timm)--minimal GUMS config is included in gums-service package now and instructions are available Anne Heavey Working on this May 20,2005 Dan Yocum contacting VOs for policy.	 Plan is also to have a minimal default configuration for folks who do not reply.<br>
*Partial resolution*:Anne H provided instructions in GumsConfigStepByStep, but hasn't addressed policy issues (5/27/05.)

---+++VDT Installation Issues

	* Conflict with PERL 32 bit libraries and 64 bit PERL on x86_64 machines.<br>
	  <b>Work Around:</b> Put a 32 bit PERL first in the execution path before performing the pacman get. (Not yet reported as successfully done)
	  (Main.DaneSkow - 6/2/2005)<br>
		<b>Resolution:</b> %RED% VDT working on more persistent solution.%ENDCOLOR%<br>

	 
---++Guides for Site Administrators
The SiteAdmins web describes how services listed below are installed, configured, and checked
by the site administrators.  The is where, for example, you'll find the "Core Middleware" or "Computing Element" installation instructions.
	* To shut down services prior to the upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
	* For a detailed step-by-step guide to the core installation procedures, see the OSGCEInstallGuide.

---++Guides for GUMS Administrators
The GumsAdmins topic describes how and why to use the Privilege software, GUMS. The broader context is outlined in PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo.

---++Guides for VO Administrators
The VoAdmins page provides information for VO administrators.  There are also some new pages specific to the authentication / authorization chain available:
	* PrivilegeVOWhatToDo 
	* PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo
	* GoldenChainDebugging for debugging the privilege components and their interaction.

The [[ItbVo][VO registration]] procedure should be used to communicate a *VO level* service to grid resources (sites/gatekeepers). 

---++ Pacman Recommendation
The installation instructions are based on PacmanInfo.  For this release, we recommend *Pacman 3.11*.

---++ OSG Compute Element (CE) Description

---++ VDT
We will use the %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION6% release of the VirtualDataToolkit, see the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/%OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION6%/release.html">release notes</a>. 

---++ Globus 4 gridftp

Included with VDT.  The GridFTP page describes the service integration in detail.

---++ MonALISA
MonALISA from VDT is used for this release. 

---++ Privilege and VO services infrastructure
Description of PrivilegeOSG options for this release. As of this release, the PRIMA interpretation of extended proxies has been fixed to match the VOMS usage. Use of PRIMA for role-based authorization decisions is supported as of this release. 
The GUMS version should be 1.0.1 from VDT 1.3.6 and the VOMS Admin and VOMS Server should be installed from the VDT 1.3.6. to ensure correct functioning.

---++ Discovery Service
Description of the 
[[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]]
deployed in this release.  Here are the DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions.

The Discovery Service version 0.5.3 is deployed on a JClarens server version 0.5.3 for this OTB release.  Installation of the Discovery Service is optional for the ITB.

---++ Disk Resource Manager

	* We are not recommending installation and use of the disk based storage resource manager, SRM-DRM.
	* Stay tuned to DiskResourceManager for updates.


---++ Site Verify
The SiteVerify package has its own  
[[http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html"]][[web page]] 
for release documentation, but has been included in the pacman cache as of this release.


---++ CMS Tier1 SE
The service is based on SRM-dCACHE and satisfies the SRM V1.1 interface, with additions for implicit 
space reservation.  CMSSrmdCache provides the readiness plan. The service will be available to all registered OSG VO's.
To use the SE requires an SRM V1.1 compatible client.  This is available from VDT (as part of the DRM package) or from anonymous ftp 
to fnkits.fnal.gov://products/srmcp/v1_11/NULL (v1.12 almost available and should probably be the version deployed.)

[v1_15 has been announced by Timur on May 13. The recommended version may be the same, needs to be confirmed : Abhishek S R, 05/20/2005]

---++ SRM DRM (Testing)
A disk based storage resource manager from the LBL group.  Integration plan and associated activities are available at SrmDrm.
