---++ $APP

This area is intended for VO-wide software installations.

It is required that relative paths resolve consistently between gatekeeper and worker nodes even if the $APP variable differs between the two.  It is strongly recommended that the variable and paths are the same as well, or most legacy software will not function properly.  This area may be read-only for a subset of users: there is no guarantee that every user will have write access.  $APP must point to a POSIX-compliant filesystem for software installation. 

---++ $DATA

This area is intended to hold readable datasets for jobs executing on the worker nodes.

It is required that relative paths resolve consistently between gatekeeper and worker nodes.  
This area may be read-only for a subset of users: there is no guarantee that every user will have write access.
$DATA may point to a filesystem or gsiftp URL.

---++ $TMP

This area is intended as a temporary work area, and cache location for staging files in and out.

It is required that relative paths resolve consistently between gatekeeper and worker nodes.  This area must be read-write for all users.  $TMP may point to a filesystem or gsiftp URL.  Files placed here are guaranteed not to be purged for at least 24 hours barring extraordinary cirucmstances; the precise purge policy is determined by site administrators.

---++ $WN_TMP

This area is a temporary work area that may be purged when the job completes.

It is required that $WN_TMP points to a POSIX-compliant filesystem.
