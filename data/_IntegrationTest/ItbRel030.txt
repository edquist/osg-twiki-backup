---++Summary of this Release
This page provides a general overview of the OSG release candidate 0.3.0, to be deployed on the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). It is based
on [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.7/index.html][VDT 1.3.7]] which has major upgrades to Globus (includes web services from Globus 4.0.1). 
We are providing two deployment options - a fully web services based installation, and one which installs the pre-webservices Globus which may
be important to some VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's and sites for backwards compatiblity and migration.

---++ Validation and work to do
Descriptions of validation exercises of both applications and services using ITB release 0.3.0.  
  
   * Descriptions of validations of the ITB 0.3 serives are located at  ValidationPage (previous validation page for ITB 0.1.5 is now at ValidationPageRel01).
   * General page for the current IntegrationTestbed.
   * The current ITB 0.3 workplan is [[ITB03WorkPlan][here]].
   * Instructions need to be updated.  The CE install guide for [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ItbRel016][ITB 0.1.6]] is at 
       OSGCEInstallGuide as well as information for SiteAdmins.

   * Which ports are in use? (Xin, Nov 3)
<pre>
Hi Leigh,

Do you have a list of the ports need to open for the WS version
of ITB 0.3? I have a new machine for the ITB gatekeeper, and
we need to apply for the conduits.

Thanks,
Xin

   * gram_condor_log non-unique in 0.3.0?  (Burt, Anand: Nov 1,3)

<pre>

I got this exact same issue when installing ITB-0.3.0 per-ws version on
UIOWA-ITB. Is having just one 'gram_condor_log' by design. 

Giving everyone write permissions to 'gram_condor_log' fixes the issue
as expected. Does anyone sees an issue with doing it this way.

Thanks
Anand

ITBers,

I just completed an ITB CE install on cmsitbsrv01 including getting the 
Condor jobmanager step.

The files in $VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp/gram_job_state used to have some 
(random?) numbers appended to them, i.e.:

gram_condor_log.7981.1130860008

In 0.3.0, it appears as just gram_condor_log.  Since the files are mode 
644, once a grid job comes in for condor, others fail with globus error 17.

Have others seen this?
