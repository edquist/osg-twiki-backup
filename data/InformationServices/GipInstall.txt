The preferred way to install the GIP is through the VDT; this page is meant for those who want to install it from the SVN repository.

Again, *this is not a page for normal site admins*.  A site admin would only want to use this in the case that there is a direly-needed unreleased bug fix.

---+++ Original Branch (deployed in OSG 0.8.0)

   1. Download the GIP source code:
      =svn co svn://t2.unl.edu/brian/gip/branches/original/ gip=
   1. Copy the GIP source code into your VDT install:
      =cp -r gip/* $VDT_LOCATION=
   1. Source the VDT install:
      =source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh=
   1. Run the configure-osg.sh script:
      =$VDT_LOCATION/configure-osg.sh=

---++++ Configuration and Test

Configuration is done by providing sane values to the =configure-osg.sh= script; if you would like to test out the dcache provider, make sure you name your implementation as =dcache= and follow the on-screen instructions.

To see what data would be sent to the GOC, run:
<verbatim>
$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/glite-ce-ce-plugin/glite-ce-info $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/etc/osg-info-generic.conf
</verbatim>

---+++ Trunk (deployed in OSG 0.9.0)

   1. Download the GIP source code:
      =svn co svn://t2.unl.edu/brian/gip/trunk/gip gip=
   1. Set the $VDT_LOCATION variable and the $GIP_LOCATION to =$PWD/gip/=.
   1. That's all!  The only runtime requirement for the GIP is those two environmental variables.

---++++ Configuration and Test

Configuration is done by providing sane values to the =configure-osg.sh= script; if you would like to test out the dcache provider, make sure you name your implementation as =dcache= and follow the on-screen instructions.

To see what data would be sent to the GOC, source the OSG environment (=source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh=), then run this script:
<verbatim>
gip_info
</verbatim>

Any failures will be written to stderr, and the raw LDIF will be written to stdout; if some component is misbehaving, redirect stdout to just view the stderr:
<verbatim>
gip_info 1> /dev/null
</verbatim>
