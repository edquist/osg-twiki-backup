---+ Desired changes for the GIP 1.2 and beyond

The GIP 1.2 will have two significant features:
   * Complete freedom from any static information.  Removal of configure-gip script.  This removes the necessity to have the OSG installed for the GIP. (DONE)
   * Integration with the config.ini, meaning no intermediate *-attributes.conf files need to be read. (DONE)

On top of that, we plan incremental improvements in the storage, unit testing, and command line utilities.

The GIP 1.4 will have:
   * GLUE 2.0 support
   * XML support (if desired)

---++ Schema
Allow a site to have multiple CEs, SEs, and other resources.
   * Need to start making provisions for GLUE 2.0.  The new framework should help ease this transition

---++ Dynamic improvements
   * Need to address the obvious issue of using a single world-writable file (grid3-locations.txt) to publish software locations

---++ Default attributes
   * Populate default set of attributes if configure-osg doesn't deliver? (DONE)
   * Distinguish between real values and defaulted ones from provider timeouts?

---++ Command Line Tools
Have a decent set of command line tools for the site administrator
   * gip_status: Last status of the GIP, as measured by the timestamp provider and the GOC monitoring page
   * gip_site_print: Prints the top-level CE, SE, Site, Services (everything but the SA areas and the VO Views)
   * gip_ce_print: Prints the batch system information from the CE
We shouldn't do too many of these as lcg-utils will be overlap this (diagnostics lcg-utils won't cover; site_print type scripts lcg-utils will cover.  From Ted).

---++ Finish plugin rewrites
OSG 1.0 saw new modules for storage and PBS.  The following need to be converted to GIP providers:
   * condor: Implementation done for sites with no Condor groups (DONE)
   * SGE: Implementation started by Tony
   * LSF: Implementation not started

These new modules are important because we need more flexible code so we don't have to do a complete rewrite for GLUE 2.0!

---++ New OSG Info Wrapper
Finish the mostly-written osg-info-wrapper, plus the unit tests.  The new OSG info wrapper will know what add/alter-attributes are "natively", integrate with gip.conf (removing the need for another config file), and have a "remove-attributes.conf" which would allow you to remove entities. (DONE)
   * This work is mostly done.
   * Test cases have been written and passed.
   * Just needs wider-scale testing.

---++ Storage Modules
   * Ask BestMan folks to contribute something; maybe a new plugin?  Alex Sim is in charge of this (from Ted). (DONE)
   * Remove Postgres dependency; take SRM information straight from the admin interface. (DONE)
   * Overlap with Gratia Storage probes - what's the best way forward? (from Ted)
   * Integrate dCache probes with upcoming InfoProvider (delayed until sites switch to dCache 1.9)

---++ Testing
PBS already has a few unit tests, and it would be nice to start having more.
   * Expand the unit tests to other batch managers. (DONE)
   * Hook a testing framework into the dCache admin interface.
   * Package Tony's web interface so it can be run in the OSG's apache, like RSV currently does.

---++ Extensions
   * A test WS-GRAM module has been written.  Include it in the main distribution.  This is necessary as WS-GRAM becomes more interesting to VOs!
   * Include MPI work from CEMon/Engagement folks (in addition to publishing in the EGEE-recommended format)
   * Synchronize downtime info with the GOC maintenance tool.

---++ Integration with the OSG site cfg file
GIP and configure-osg.py both use same config file format.
   * Make the GIP read configure-osg.py natively. (DONE)
   * Proof of concept code written

---++ Remove remaining static information
Remaining static components: (DONE)
   * cese_bind: Dynamic module written; included in OSG 1.0 for PBS sites. (DONE)
   * storage elements: Dynamic module for dCache written; write dynamic module for "other" sites (Alex Sim for BestMan). (DONE)
   * classicSE: Not started (DONE)
   * subclusters and clusters: Proof of concept code written, but not tested. (DONE)
   * site: Dynamic module written, working, but not included in OSG 1.0 due to time (DONE)
   * remaining batch systems: PBS done, SGE and Condor started, LSF not started. (DONE)
