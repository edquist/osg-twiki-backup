---++ GIP Meeting
   * Attendees: Burt, Suchandra, Brian, Anand, Steve Timm
   * Apologies: Tony (furlough)

---++ Current issues
   * The =GlueCEInfoDefaultSE= parameter is set to =UNAVAILABLE= in the case of a "classic SE" configuration (the SE is the gatekeeper's disk).  This is flagged as an issue with the GIP validation tool at http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu.  This seems to be a bug in =configure_gip=.  Tony has patched this in the trunk but not in the 1.0.0 release branch.
   * There are issues with =token_info_provider.py= for SRM/dCache Storage Elements, affecting both BNL and Fermigrid:

</verbatim>
Brian is investigating with Steve Timm.
   * Better documentation needed on how to black/whitelist PBS queues, particularly since the previous ACL-based mechanism no longer works.
   * The GIP validator at http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu/itb/index.html is showing problems at TTU_ANTAEUS and UC_ITB.  Burt will investigate TTU_ANTAEUS; Brian will work with Suchandra on UC_ITB.  UC_ITB's issues include:
      * =GlueLocationPath= missing for =OSG_GRID=
      * Condor queues being advertised for a PBS site
      * Missing =GlueCEInfoApplicationDir=, =GlueCEInfoDataDir=
      * Missing =GlueCESEBindAccesspoint=
      * Missing =GlueClusterWNTmpDir=, =GlueClusterTmpDir=

---++ Other validation tools
   * Tony's validation pages are at http://home.fnal.gov/~tiradani/.  This is a work in progress, so not everything is well-documented yet.

---++ OSG 1.2
   * Keep sending your wishlists -- OSG 1.0 hasn't been cut yet, so I haven't talked to the appropriate management about 1.2 priorities yet.

---++ Next Meeting
