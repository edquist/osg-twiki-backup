---+ OSG Info Services Overview

The OSG provides a variety of information about its services and resources.  The information services currently deployed have been maturing over the last several years, and it appears they will be relatively stable for the next few years.  This document aims to help an application developer who wants to utilize one (or more) of the OSG information services.  By the end of the document, you should have a feel for what types of information exists, where to get "authoritative" views of the information, and what kinds of query formats are available.

This document is broken into three parts:
   * *Information Types*: Broad categorization of different information available about OSG resources and services.
   * *Information Producers*: Grid Services and Software which produce or save information about OSG resources and services.
   * *Information Interfaces*: Machine or human readable interfaces that an application developer might interact with.

---++ Information Types

We divide the different types of grid information
   1 *Naming or topology*: The official names for an OSG facility, site, resource-group, or resource.  The mapping between hostname and official name.  How the various grid constructs (facility, site, resource-group, and resource) relate to each other in the official topology.  _Example_: The facility "University of Nebraska" contains two sites, "Nebraska-Lincoln" and "Nebraska-Omaha".  Nebraska-Omaha has one resource group called "Firefly".  Firefly is composed of three CEs (Firefly, Firefly-2, and Firefly-3) and one SE (Firefly-SE).  Firefly-SE has a hostname of ff-se.unl.edu
   1 *Endpoint Information*: Static or semi-static information needed to find and utilize an OSG service.  This might include the Globus contact strings for a service, the SRM endpoint, or the location of the $OSG_APP directory.  _Example_: Firefly-SE has an SRM endpoint of srm://ff-se.unl.edu:8443/srm/v2/server.  The Engage VO can write into the directory /panfs/panasas/CMS/data/engage.
   1 *Status*: The current status of an OSG service.  _Example_: Firefly-SE is not in downtime and passing all the critical SRMv2 tests.
