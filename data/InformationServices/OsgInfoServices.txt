---+ OSG Info Services Overview

The OSG provides a variety of information about its services and resources.  The information services currently deployed have been maturing over the last several years, and it appears they will be relatively stable for the next few years.  This document aims to help an application developer who wants to utilize one (or more) of the OSG information services.  By the end of the document, you should have a feel for what types of information exists, where to get "authoritative" views of the information, and what kinds of query formats are available.

This document is broken into three parts:
   * *Information Types*: Broad categorization of different information available about OSG resources and services.
   * *Information Producers*: Grid Services and Software which produce or save information about OSG resources and services.
   * *Information Interfaces*: Machine or human readable interfaces that an application developer might interact with.

---++ Information Types

We divide the different types of grid information
   1 *Naming or topology*: The official names for an OSG facility, site, resource-group, or resource.  The mapping between hostname and official name.  How the various grid constructs (facility, site, resource-group, and resource) relate to each other in the official topology.  _Example_: The facility "University of Nebraska" contains two sites, "Nebraska-Lincoln" and "Nebraska-Omaha".  Nebraska-Omaha has one resource group called "Firefly".  Firefly is composed of three CEs (Firefly, Firefly-2, and Firefly-3) and one SE (Firefly-SE).  Firefly-SE has a hostname of ff-se.unl.edu
   1 *Endpoint Information*: Static or semi-static information needed to find and utilize an OSG service.  This might include the Globus contact strings for a service, the SRM endpoint, or the location of the $OSG_APP directory.  _Example_: Firefly-SE has an SRM endpoint of srm://ff-se.unl.edu:8443/srm/v2/server.  The Engage VO can write into the directory /panfs/panasas/CMS/data/engage.
   1 *Status*: The current status of an OSG service.  _Example_: Firefly-SE is not in downtime and passing all the critical SRMv2 tests.
   1 *State*: The current operational statistics of the service.  _Example_: Firefly-SE has 140TB total, 20TB free.  Firefly-3 has 800 CMS jobs (20 waiting) and 200 HCC jobs (30 waiting).  There are 0 free jobs slots.

This is one broad classification of the information; it is possible to find OSG information that does not fit neatly into one of the above categories.  However, we believe this covers the majority of the pertinent information for application developers.

---++ Information Producers

This section provides a short description of each of the information producers in the OSG.  It is useful for the application developer to have a general idea of how each works.  Note that none of the information producers listed below can be directly queried by developers (this is the job of the Information Interfaces, listed below).

---+++ RSV
RSV is a framework designed to monitor OSG services.  It consists of three parts:
   1 *Probes*:  Each RSV probe is a simple perl script utilizing a perl API.  Each probe has multiple metrics - individual tests - that it runs.  Each metric can be either critical (failure indicates the service is down) or non-critical (failure may indicate service is partially down or some part incorrectly configured).   Each service has several probes available - the probes are engineered so they do not have to be launched from the host the OSG service runs on. 
   1 *Core*:  The RSV core is a set of scripts and Condor-Cron jobs which configure RSV, handle the launching of probes, and transforming the probe output into different formats.
   1 *Transport*: RSV utilizes the same HTTP-based transport protocol developed for Gratia.  This allows a site to record its historical data locally and forward the status of its services to the central OSG services.

The core is developed under the oversight of the OSG Software Tools Group and many of the probes are developed by different OSG groups (i.e., the SRM probes are developed by the OSG-Storage team).

---+++ GIP
The GIP is software which runs on the OSG CE that interacts with various system components of the site.  It takes in information from the config files, authorization info, batch system, and the SE in order to come up with a description of the local site.  This description is generate according to a schema called GLUE and expressed in LDAP format.

The GLUE data is used heavily by international grids and is important for interoperability.  However, the GLUE schema is old by grid standards - a lot of information is "wedged in" in order to fit today's grids - and there is a high barrier to using the data, especially for new developers.

It is currently developed and maintained by the USCMS Grid Services and Interoperability effort.
