---++ Update to Security Plan in 2008
---+++ Introduction
The OSG security plan and process is based on the NIST process shown in the figure below provided by Irwin Gaines.

---++ Notes
---+++ From 800-18
---++++ documents
The *system security plan* provides a summary of the security requirements for the information system and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan also may reference other key security-related documents for the information system such as
   * a risk assessment, _(OSG Doc 488)_ 
   * plan of action and milestones, _(Mine's workplan spreadsheet and this page)_
   * accreditation decision letter, _(acceptance of security plan by the OSG Council/Executive Board and/or agency program managers)_
   * privacy impact assessment,  _(TBD)_
   * contingency plan,  _(TBD)_
   * configuration management plan, _(TBD)_ 
   * security configuration checklists,  _(TBD)_
   * and system interconnection agreements as appropriate. _(agreements with participants and partners)_
---++++ system inventory
FISMA requires that agencies have in place an information systems inventory. All information systems in the inventory should be categorized using FIPS 199 as a first step in the system security planning activity.

_Inventory is core services list for the OSG core, plus VORS and list of VOMS servers for participating resources._

---++++ labeling systems as major app., minor app., general support
All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled as a major application1 or general support system.2 Specific system security plans for minor applications3 are not required because the security controls for those applications are typically provided by the general support system or major application in which they operate.
---++++ security planning process diagram

---++++ roles
Mapping of 800-18 roles to OSG roles.  See 800-18 section 1.7 for lists of responsibilities.
   * CIO - OSG ED
   * senior agency information security officer (SAISO) - OSG Security Officer
   * Information System Owner - OSG core service owner or resource owner
   * Information owner - owner of data
   * Information System Security Officer - security contact
   * Authorizing Official - OSG ED with approval from Council/EB

---++++ Rules of Behaviour
The assorted OSG AUPs which participants sign.
"the intent is to make all users accountable for their actions by acknowledging that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior."
