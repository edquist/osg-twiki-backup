---++ Notes
---+++ From 800-18
SP 800-18 provides guidelines on developing security plans for information systems.

---++++ documents
The *system security plan* provides a summary of the security requirements for the information system and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan also may reference other key security-related documents for the information system such as
   * a risk assessment, _(OSG Doc 488)_ 
   * plan of action and milestones, _(Mine's workplan spreadsheet and this page)_
   * accreditation decision letter, _(acceptance of security plan by the OSG Council/Executive Board and/or agency program managers)_
   * privacy impact assessment,  _(TBD)_
   * contingency plan,  _(TBD)_
   * configuration management plan, _(TBD)_ 
   * security configuration checklists,  _(TBD)_
   * and system interconnection agreements as appropriate. _(agreements with participants and partners)_
---++++ system inventory
FISMA requires that agencies have in place an information systems inventory. All information systems in the inventory should be categorized using FIPS 199 as a first step in the system security planning activity.

_Inventory is core services list for the OSG core, plus VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS and list of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers for participating resources._

---++++ labeling systems as major app., minor app., general support
All information systems must be covered by a system security plan and labeled as a major application1 or general support system.2 Specific system security plans for minor applications3 are not required because the security controls for those applications are typically provided by the general support system or major application in which they operate.
   * major application - A major application is expected to have a FIPS 199 impact level of moderate or high.

---++++ security planning process diagram

---++++ roles
Mapping of 800-18 roles to OSG roles.  See 800-18 section 1.7 for lists of responsibilities.
   * CIO - OSG ED
   * senior agency information security officer (SAISO) - OSG Security Officer
   * Information System Owner - OSG core service owner or resource owner
   * Information owner - owner of data
   * Information System Security Officer - security contact
   * Authorizing Official - OSG ED with approval from Council/EB

---++++ Rules of Behaviour
The assorted OSG AUPs which participants sign.
"the intent is to make all users accountable for their actions by acknowledging that they have read, understand, and agree to abide by the rules of behavior."

---++++ major app run on general support system
If a system is defined as a major application and the application is run on another organization's general support system, the major application owner is responsible for acceptance of risk and in addition:
   * Notifies the general support system owner that the application is critical and provides specific security requirements;
   * Provides a copy of the major application's system security plan to the operator of the general support system;
   * Requests a copy of the system security plan of the general support system and ensures that it provides adequate protection for the application and information; and
   * Includes a reference to the general support system security plan in the major application system security plan.

The general support system plan should reference the major application system security plan.

_Consider these ideas as relation between OSG and resource providers and VOs._

---++++ minor applications
It is very common that a minor application may have a majority of its security controls provided by the general support system or major application on which it resides. If this is the case, the information system owner of the general support system or major application is the information system owner for the minor application and is responsible for developing the
system security plan.
The additional security controls specific to the minor application should be documented in the system security plan as an appendix or paragraph.

The minor application owner (often the same as information owner) may develop the appendix or paragraph describing the additional controls. The complete general support system or major application system security plan should be shared with the information owner.

---++++ common controls
Every control in a security control baseline must be addressed either by the agency through common security controls or by the information system owner.

Security controls not designated as common controls are considered system-specific controls and are the responsibility of the information system owner.

_Consider common controls are like institutional controls applying to hosted OSG services._

---++++ FIPS 199 Impact Categorization
<br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/fips199-categorization.jpg" alt="fips199-categorization.jpg" width='717' height='668' />

---++++ Interconnections
In this section, for each interconnection between systems that are owned or operated by different organizations, provide the following information concerning the authorization for the connection to other systems or the sharing of information:
   * Name of system;
   * Organization;
   * Type of interconnection (Internet, Dial-Up, etc.);
   * Authorizations for interconnection (MOU/MOA, ISA);
   * Date of agreement;
   * FIPS 199 Category;
   * Certification and accreditation status of system; and
   * Name and title of authorizing official(s).
For agencies with numerous interconnections, a table format including the above information may be a good way to present the information.

---++++ control descriptions
The description should contain 
   1) the security control title; 
   2) how the security control is being implemented or planned to be implemented; 
   3) any scoping guidance that has been applied and what type of consideration; and 
   4) indicate if the security control is a common control and who is responsible for its implementation.

---++++ security plan maintenance
Once the information system security plan is developed, it is important to periodically assess the plan, review any change in system status, functionality, design, etc., and ensure that the plan continues to reflect the correct information about the system. This documentation and its correctness are critical for system certification activity. All plans should be reviewed and updated, if appropriate, at least annually. Some items to include in the review are:
   * Change in information system owner;
   * Change in information security representative;
   * Change in system architecture;
   * Change in system status;
   * Additions/deletions of system interconnections;
   * Change in system scope;
   * Change in authorizing official; and
   * Change in certification and accreditation status.
