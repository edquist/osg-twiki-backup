---++ Project Plan for Pakiti Software Distribution
---+++ Overview
The OSG security team will start distributing Pakiti software vulnerability monitoring software for sites to use to help them understand which of their systems need security patches installed.

---+++ Goal
We will make the software available via the OSG yum repository, and provide documentation on how to install and use.

---+++ Scope
   * This release will be intended for sites to install and use to track their own software installs. OSG also has a central pakiti service currently at https://osg-pakiti.ncsa.illinois.edu.

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team:
      * Kevin Hill (Primary)
      * Anand Padmanabhan (Secondary, managing central Pakiti project)


---+++ Stage one:
Evaluate test installs and develop initial config files to be
distributed, as well as detailed install instructions. Should be done by
8/30/12.

---+++ Stage two:
Hand off std. distribution packages and customized config files to
software team for osg-rpm-ization. Done by 9/30/12.

---+++ Stage three:
Deploy in OSG software repos and ask sites to install and test the
software and install instructions. Done by 10/30/12

Stage four:
Evaluate new version of pakiti when available. Investigate possible
anonymous aggregation of site data to get OSG-wide view of vulnerable
systems.
 
---+++ Deliverables from the project:
   * RPMS in OSG repo available.
   * Installation instructions.
   * Usage Instructions.

---++++ Additional Notes
---+++ Dependencies/ Risks
---+++ Affected Parties
