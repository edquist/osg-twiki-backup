   * New SSL vulnerability, another man in the middle attack to force use of export grade crypto, which can be broken via nation state sized operations. Should not affect security of certs and keys. 
   * Fermilab KCA to Cilogon Basic CA transition. 
      * Jim Basney provided solution for loading CILogon Basic CA certs into myproxy.
      * Myproxy can authenticate via pam or sasl, so pretty flexible.
