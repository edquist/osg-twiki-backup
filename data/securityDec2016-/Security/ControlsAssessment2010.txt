---+ Security Control Assessment 2010

---++Management Controls
---+++ Roles and Responsibilities – Line Organization
   * Security Plan Section: 2.2.1.1
   * REPORT: Seek permission to change control frequency from 6 months to a year. Mine Altunay is found to be Education VO Manager in OIM records. Find out if this is on purpose as she does not play a role in managing this VO.  Change has been made to the Security Plan that Security Officer is listed as security contact for OSG VO rather than OSG Executive Director. this change reflects the current recording in OIM. 
---+++ Awareness for OSG Managers
   * Security Plan Section: 2.2.1.2 
   * Awareness materials containing necessary information for OSG Managers: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=573][OSG Document 573]] provides relevant information. 
   * REPORT: The awareness material needs minor updating. It is a very broad document that covers above and beyond awareness materials (60+ slides). It needs to be shorten before presented to area leads. A regular venue such as OSG AHM can be used to present the awareness materials to the area leads periodically. The control can be updated to also check how frequently the awareness training is given.   
---+++ Accountability of Sites, Users, and VO’s
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.3 
   * Banning Users: OSG software stack provides the sites with two mechanisms to get the list of users from VO (GUMS, edg-mkgridmap). Both these mechanisms provide capabilities to ban user at the site. Technical information on how to conduct this banning may be found on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BanningUsersAtSite][twiki]]. Furthermore we maintain VO security contacts on OSG Information Management System (OIM) (validated yearly) who could be contacted and be asked to remove the offending user from their VOMS.
   * Banning VO: OSG distributes the names of the VOs and the location of the VOMS servers as a template that is used by both GUMS and edg-mkgridmap at the site. If we need to ban a VO OSG is capable of quickly publishing a new template file with the offending VO removed. The sites could then easily update the GUMS/edg-mkgridmap configuration to use the new template. Furthermore the VO will be removed from OIM.
   * Banning Sites: For baning a site GOC will remove the site from OIM. Once the site is removed from OIM it gets automatically removed from OSG and interop BDII, Resource Service Validation (RSV) and OSG resource brokering service. Any users/VO relying on the official services will no longer see the site listed as an OSG site.
   * Awareness materials with responsibilities for accountability: We have Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) documents for [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Users]], [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=742][VOs]], and [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][service level agreement]]. We also provide template for Site and VOs to outline their own policy for users.
   * Mine is satisfied with the service agreement and AUP.
   * TODO: When user registers a Site/VO on OIM are they should be shown and agree to AUP. Rob has opened a ticket to make sure this gets implemented in OIM. 

---++ Security Process
---+++Security Lifecycle Meeting
   * Weekly meeting minutes can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/MeetingMinutes2010]]
---+++ Area Coordinators Briefing
   * Meeting minutes can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/AreaCoordinator]]
   * REPORT
      * This control requires Area Coordinators and Executive Team to examine the briefing minutes. Changing the control ownership to the security team is more efficient. Ask permission to change the control owner. 
---+++ Risk assessment 
   * Risk assessment document can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/RiskAssessment09]] The document has been updated in the past year. 
   * REPORT: The risk assessment document should be presented to Executive Team for official signature and acceptance.

      * The OSG Registration Process has a sub-process on issuing service certificates. This sub-process should be updated. 
      * Secure Email key Management. A separate but related process is needed. The new process should explain where and how the security team decided on a new shared PGP key for the team. It should also state where this new key is published. 
      * Software Vulnerability Handling Process should be reviewed by security and VDT teams jointly. The VDT team should confirm that they can perform the steps assigned to them. If not, the process should be updated. 
      * The Executive Director should approve signature on these documents
---+++ Self Assessment

---++ Operational Controls
---+++ Security Training and Awareness
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/SecurityAwarenessForTheOSG][Security Awareness for OSG]] 
---++++ Role-based training
   * Major roles and responsibility for each area coordinator are highlighted at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AreaCoordinatorsSecurityTraining]].
   * Invited the area coordinators for a training session.
      * Alain Roy was invited and attended a OSG security call to review and discuss the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AreaCoordinatorsSecurityTraining#Software_Coordinator][security roles and responsibility laid out for software coordinator]]. 
         * Section in the document has been updated based on discussion.
         * The list of services the VDT maintains that might be subject to security control can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/VDTServicesSecurityControl]]
      * Operation Coordinator Rob Quick was invited and his proxy Scott Teige attended a a OSG security meeting to review and discuss the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AreaCoordinatorsSecurityTraining#Operations_Coordinator][security roles and responsibility laid out for operations coordinator]]. 
         * Section in the document has been updated based on discussion.
   * REPORT: 
      * Ask permission to change the frequency of this control to a year from 6 months. 
      * Discuss whether it is needed to provide training for area leads other than software and operations. Production area lead should also be covered in this training. 
---++++ Regular OSG Core Security Phone Conference
   * Done. Weekly meetings happen every Tuesday and minutes are recorded in security working area.
---++++ OSG and Other Security Mailing Lists
   * Examined.
---++++ Security Briefings and Discussions at Consortium Meetings 
   * The security team held two sessions at the OSG All-Hands meeting in 2011. The second session included a security questionnaire that had previously sent to resource security contacts and discussions on their needs. http://ahm.sbgrid.org/. The security team is also invited to the Council meeting on April 12, 2012. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Council/April-12-2011 

---+++ Incident Response
---++++Incident Planning
   * OSG has following documents related to incident response:
      * Incident Handling and Response Guide [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=19][doc-db#19]] 
      * Incident Response Process is documented on the twiki at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/IncidentResponseProcess]].
      * Incident Response Policy [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=875][doc-db#875]]
   * REPORT
      * Incident Response Policy is reviewed and found to be complete and accurate. It lacks Executive Team's signature. This policy is in pending status. Once decided to be approved, this policy may be linked to OSG AUP and Service Agreement Plans. This policy is a summary of the Incident Response Guide which already has been linked at Service Agreement Document. 
      * Incident Handling and Response Guide is reviewed. The guide should be updated. Following issues are noted during the examination. The definition of incident is broader than the definition agreed upon at last JSPG meeting as stated in [[http://www.jspg.org/wiki/Security_Incident_Response_Policy][JSPG Incident Response Policy]]. This is not a critical problem, but it should be corrected at next update of the Guide. The Guide asks "Grid participants MUST respond to incidents involving locally managed or operated resources, services, or identities." The Guide should clarify that this request only covers resources that may affect other grid resources. Otherwise this guide attempts to mandate policies over local resources. The Guide describes the incident response process. OSG has a separate response process described in the twiki. The process included in the Guide does not match accurately the process on the twiki. The Guide can eliminate including the process and refer to the separate process document. Section 6.5.1 in the Guide seems irrelevant.  
      * The Incident Response Process should be updated to clarify where incident reports are kept. The current process refers to twiki. However, security team keeps some reports as filed in the footprints ticketing system. 
      * All of the above policies, plans and procedures are also examined as part of the control 2.2.2.4 Policies, Procedures, and Plans. This control is redundant. However, given incident response is such a crucial part of operational security, this redundancy is useful and should not be eliminated.  

---++++Incident Discovery and Mandatory Reporting
   * GOC monitors security@opensciencegrid.org and triages incident reports and forwards security incidents to the OSG security team. The security team tested the mailing list reporting capabilities on 3/22 with a test incident report. 
   * Security drills were conducted by OSG on uscms and usatlas tier 2 sites that measure how site security contacts followed the incident discovery process.
   * Every year a presentation from the security team at OSG All Hands Meeting covers the incident reporting process http://ahm.sbgrid.org/ 
   * At OSG AHM 2011 the security team provided a survey that measures security contacts' familiarity with incident response process. The surveys are located at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AllHandsMeeting2011SecuritySurveys  


---++++Invocation of the Incident Response Plan
   * The documents describing the procedures, identifying contacts, communication strategies are recorded on the twiki at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityTeamWorkingArea#Incident_Response_Procedures]] and were examined.
   * The security team generated a test incident and observed the GOC's response. The test was conducted on 3/22 and the results were discussed internally.  
---++++Incident Handling

---++++Incident Analysis and Reporting
   * Though we have not had a serious security incident in OSG incident reports and notifications sent to OSG security contacts from this and earlier years have been recorded on the OSG twiki at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityTeamWorkingArea#Incident_Response_Reports]]
