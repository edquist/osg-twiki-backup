---+ Security Contol Assessment 2010

---++Management Controls
---+++ Roles and Responsibilities – Line Organization
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.1
   * Completed 5/3/2011.
   * REPORT: Seek permission to change control frequency from 6 months to a year. Mine Altunay is found to be Education VO Manager in OIM records. Find out if this is on purpose as she does not play a role in managing this VO.  Change has been made to the Security Plan that Security Officer is listed as security contact for OSG VO rather than OSG Executive Director. this change reflects the current recording in OIM. 
---+++ Awareness for OSG Managers
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.2 
   * Awareness materials containing necessary information for OSG Managers: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=573][OSG Document 573]] provides relevant information. 
   * TODO: Need to carefully review and update the aforementioned document if necessary. 
---+++ Accountability of Sites, Users, and VO’s
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.3 
   * Banning Users: OSG software stack provides the sites with two mechanisms to get the list of users from VO (GUMS, edg-mkgridmap). Both these mechanisms provide capabilities to ban user at the site. Technical information on how to conduct this banning may be found on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BanningUsersAtSite][twiki]]. Furthermore we maintain VO security contacts on OSG Information Management System (OIM) (validated yearly) who could be contacted and be asked to remove the offending user from their VOMS.
   * Banning VO: OSG distributes the names of the VOs and the location of the VOMS servers as a template that is used by both GUMS and edg-mkgridmap at the site. If we need to ban a VO OSG is capable of quickly publishing a new template file with the offending VO removed. The sites could then easily update the GUMS/edg-mkgridmap configuration to use the new template. Furthermore the VO will be removed from OIM.
   * Banning Sites: For baning a site GOC will remove the site from OIM. Once the site is removed from OIM it gets automatically removed from OSG and interop BDII, Resource Service Validation (RSV) and OSG resource brokering service. Any users/VO relying on the official services will no longer see the site listed as an OSG site.
   * Awareness materials with responsibilities for accountability: We have Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) documents for [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Users]], [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=742][VOs]], and [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][service level agreement]]. We also provide template for Site and VOs to outline their own policy for users.
   * Mine is satisfied with the service agreement and AUP.
   * TODO: When user registers a Site/VO on OIM are they should be shown and agree to AUP. Rob has opened a ticket to make sure this gets implemented in OIM.
