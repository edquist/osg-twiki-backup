---+ Security Contol Assessment 2010

---++Management Controls
---+++ Roles and Responsibilities – Line Organization
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.1
   * TODO: Org chart Update - Need to email Ruth to get updated chart
---+++ Awareness for OSG Managers
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.2 
   * Awareness materials containing necessary information for OSG Managers: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=573][OSG Document 573]] provides relevant information. 
   * TODO: Need to carefully review and update the aforementioned document if necessary. 
---+++ Accountability of Sites, Users, and VO’s
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.3 
   * Banning Users: OSG software stack provides the sites with two mechanisms to get the list of users from VO (GUMS, edg-mkgridmap). Both these mechanisms provide capabilities to ban user at the site. Technical information on how to conduct this banning may be found on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BanningUsersAtSite][twiki]]. Furthermore we maintain VO security contacts on OSG Information Management System (OIM) (validated yearly) who could be contacted and be asked to remove the offending user from their VOMS.
   * Banning VO: OSG distributes the names of the VOs and the location of the VOMS servers as a template that is used by both GUMS and edg-mkgridmap at the site. If we need to ban a VO OSG is capable of quickly publishing a new template file with the offending VO removed. The sites could then easily update the GUMS/edg-mkgridmap configuration to use the new template. Furthermore the VO will be removed from OIM.
   * Banning Sites: For baning a site OSG could remove the site from the OIM, OSG and interop BDII, Resource Service Validation (RSV) and OSG resource brokering service. Any users/VO relying on the official services will no longer see the site listed as an OSG site.
   * TODO: Get Rob Q to verify the above writeup
   * Awareness materials with responsibilities for accountability: We have Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) documents for [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Users]], [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=742][VOs]]. We also provide template for Site and VOs to outline their own policy for users.
   * TODO: Did not find site policy document on docdb.
   * TODO: Mine needs to double check if AUPs are still acceptable.
   * TODO: When you register a Site/VO on OIM are you shown and agree to AUP?  If not, why?
