---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * on vacation until the end of July.

*Anand*
   * RSV probe. We are convinced that 8 days is a reasonable. Our question is why this probe affects the availability. It seems EGI sites are not evaluated based on this probe. Mine will ask Rob why this probe is critical and counts towards availability. 
   * Transition to new layout. Project plan is updated. Look at it for updated items.  Items to do: find out the VOMS versions. Cretae a transition plan.  
   * Pakiti: Got a response from Pakiti developer. Releasing v3. No current funding problems, supported by EGI. The developer saw no technical problems subscribing OSG sites to the EGI instance. Job submission will not be a problem. Because currently a separate entity (e.g. Anand's scripts) submits the jobs to the sites. The results from the sites are sent to the Pakiti. Anand's script submits a Pakiti client to sites. Pakiti client configures itself to send the results back to the Pakiti server. Michael will raise the request to host this service for OSG in EGI-CSIRT. No outstanding items. 
   * ca-cert-updates. Still waiting for Alain's write up. 
   * August 6-9, Anand is at a conference. Will skip the meeting 
   

*Marko*
   * GRAM5 logging ability. Verify whihc information is logged and whether this is sufficient for our auditing purposes. Contact CMS tier1 to find out existing logging capabilities.     

   * made the blog posting about sudo vulnerability. Conclusion is that it has no real effect on osg sites. 
   * Project: documenting how sudo and setuid privileges are used in OSG architecture.  
   * Nothing to report form ops meeting.
