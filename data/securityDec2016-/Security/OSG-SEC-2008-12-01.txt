---+ OSG-SEC-2008-12-01

OSG was notified on November 30th, 2008 by fellow grid sites about increased activity in account compromise, root compromise and installation of backdoors on non-OSG systems. OSG acted to inform sites about the activity and verify that compromises have not spread from fellow grid sites to OSG. DFN-CERT/CERNCERT released an advisory with details (see below).

---++ Status

<!--
Suggested status labels:
NEW: Initial report is received but incident is not confirmed.  This is a triage phase.
OPEN: The existence of a security incident requiring response has been confirmed. The response is underway.
RESOLVED: The incident has been resolved but the final report has not been submitted.
CLOSED: The final report has been submitted.

   * *Status*: RESOLVED 
   * *Lead*: Aashish Sharma
   * *Responders*: Mine , Jim Basney, Keith Chadwick, 
   * *References*: OSG GOC Ticket #6083. This incident is related to [[OSG-SEC-08-05-2008]].

This incident began with notification that user account Carleton E. Detar's account was compromised in Teragrid. This user also has credentials and certificates issued by Fermi Lab use in OSG:                                 
                                                                                                              
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Carleton E. Detar/CN=UID:detar"    

---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: Medium (impact on user account, grid stability not at risk) 
   * *Urgency*: High:  (Since this was on going incident it was necessary to determine that users account was not compromised in OSG realm)

---++ Mitigation Plan

We had to make sure if user Carleton E. Detar had Fermi Lab certificate stored in his compromised account on Teragrid. Also, determine if the user has used his certificate in previous 7 days. 

The user has two certificates : DOEgrids and FNAL issued KCA cert.                                            
The DOEGrids cert was already expired in october.

---+++ Actions to take

Needed to make sure FNAL issued KCA and users Fermi lab issued kerberos credentials are not compromised or stored in Teragrid compromised account home directories. 

---+++ How to monitor progress

Responders should report their actions back to the incident lead. 

---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

Since this was a compromise account, we need to clarify the user activity as soon as possible. 

---+++ List of affected parties

Carleton E. Detar, OSG, Fermi Lab, Teragrid

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

Making certain that users credentials are not compromised in Fermi Lab or outside TG. 

Confirmation from Fermi lab: The FNAL issued KCA cert was NOT in TG account.

The method to do this is to get the Fermilab CST to "revoke" his
Kerberos account - set it to disallow all tickets and disable the
account in the KDC.

That will automatically remove the affected user from the VO.

No additional action is necessary or required on the part of the
fermilab VO administrators.

Dec 5th Notification from Prof. DeTar highlighting all the compromised credentials:

1) Fermi KCA 
2) Valid DOEGrids cerdentials 


<verbatim>
While the DOEGrids credentials we found in Professor DeTar's account at
NCSA were expired, he confirms that he had valid DOEGrids credentials on
his home workstation. I have revoked the certificate:

Serial Number: 0x67C0
Issuer: CN=DOEGrids CA 1,OU=Certificate Authorities,DC=DOEGrids,DC=org
Validity:
  Not Before: Tuesday, September 23, 2008 7:01:30 AM PDT US/Pacific
  Not  After: Wednesday, September 23, 2009 7:01:30 AM PDT US/Pacific
Subject: CN=Carleton DeTar 750433,OU=People,DC=doegrids,DC=org

Professor DeTar will be obtaining a new DOEGrids certificate with a new
private key but the same DN.

As Mine states, this certificate is not mapped to any OSG VOs, so this
is not an OSG operational concern.

   * *Final Report*: [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/][OSG !DocDB Document ###]]

_What was the resolution of the incident?_

<verbatim>

Because this user has no KCA certificate issued, there is no risk                                             
involving OSG.                                                                                                
                                                                                                              
From OSG perspective I am ready to close this incident.                                                      
                                                                                                              
Once TG incident response team approves, I like to send a precautionary                                       
announcement to OSG sites concerning malicious IP addresses. There is no                                      
need to mention this user's name or OSG KCA cert as there is no OSG                                           
incident. I rather like our sites to watch for ongoing attacks from                                           
malicious IPs.                                                                                                
                                                                                                              
Aashish Sharma from TG incident response team will prepare a message and                                      
we can broadcast it to our security contacts in OSG once we approve it.                                       
                                                                                                              
Thank you all

In-Reply-To: <4935B4FB.2070008@fnal.gov>   
Hello Mine & All: 

On Nov 30th NCSA and TG security team were notified by Caltech (RuthAnne Bevier) regarding IP address 

- 209.160.40.14
- 209.181.189.198 

as she saw phlanax root kit alert triggered by her sensors, trigger alert looked like this:

pHALANX2!!209.160.40.14!21+++++  

On investigating both IP address here at NCSA's tg resources and our flows we determined 
that there are a few hosts in NCSA were had connections from both IP address. 

Also we saw a Teragrid user Carleton E. Detar who also had Fermi Lab account: 

"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Carleton E. Detar/CN=UID:detar" 

The machines we see cdetar logging in to NCSA from fnal are:                                                  
                                                                                                              
- 131.225.202.12  cdetar    lqcd.fnal.gov                                                            
 - 131.225.202.1   cdetar    kaon1.fnal.gov                                                                    

Please Note: We do not have any evidence that these fnal.gov machines are compromised.
I will recommend to check flows and hosts for an anomalous activity. 

Here is the log line from NCSA's host for the compromise account: 

Nov 30 19:50:11 xxxxx sshd[3685]: Accepted password for cdetar from 209.181.189.198 port 2437 ssh2 

Both these IP address [ 209.160.40.14, 209.181.189.198 ] are malicious IP addresses.
 We have determined phalanx root kit on the machines which were making connections
 to these IP address. 

Look for these additional IP addresses which are also malicious and have made connections 
to phalanx rootkit on compromised machines: 

- 209.160.40.14   - m81.nearbygalaxies.org                                                                      
- 209.181.189.198 - ASN-QWEST - Qwest Communications Corporation                                                
- 207.224.103.198 - ASN-QWEST - Qwest Communications Corporation  
- 69.129.17.242   - h69-129-17-242.wnstmn.dsl.dynamic.tds.net
- 69.49.172.31 - 69.49.172.31.swcp.com - AS10381 SWCP-AS - Southwest Cyberport 

[ Activity seen around Sept 30th 2008 ] 

- 137.248.152.49 - pc15854.Chemie.Uni-Marburg.DE 
- 132.239.95.85 - npc.ucsd.edu 

As of phalanx rootkit - it hides itself fairly well. Most useful way for investigation is either imaging 
the disk or knoppix. Typical signatures for the rootkit are:

Things to Look for: 

- pHALANX2 - in clear text on port 22 in network traffic 
- /usr/lib/heahu.p2  directory 
- files .p2rc, .sniff, .p-2.2c in the heahu.p2 hidden directory 

Another signature we saw on a separate machine: 
- /usr/lib/huuuh.p2 (directory) 
- /usr/lib/huuuh.p2/.sniff (file) 

We are still looking through the data. Will keep you updated. Please let me know if you 
have any questions. 

Thanks,

What is the long-term mitigation plan (including changes in our operations, middleware or anything
 else that enabled the event) and timeline?

Monitor for the IP address and user account activity and look for anamolies.

Note that there are now several IP addresses in the 69.130 network                                            
block. Any connection from this location should be treated as suspicious                                      
and reported.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                              
* Update rootkit *                                                                                            
                                                                                                              
It is believed the attacker is now using a new version "2.2c" of the Phalanx2                                 
rootkit.                                                                                                      
It hides in different locations (ex: /usr/lib/heahu.p2/, /usr/lib/huuuh.p2,                                   
etc.).                                                                                                        
                                                                                                              
While the attacker has mostly been concentrated on SSH keys, it seems now that                                
standard passwords are being sniffed and reused.                                                              
                                                                                                              
At least the 64bit version of the 2.2c backdoor does not support                                              
some characters and should segfault using this command:

The resulting syslog message on <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> would look like:

Once the host has been probed, the existence of such a syslog message is a very                               
strong indication it has been infected by the rootkit.
