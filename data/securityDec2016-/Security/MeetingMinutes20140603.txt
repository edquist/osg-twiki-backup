   * Two more Xsede users had compromised accounts. Does not seem to be connected, does not seem to have OSG connections. In both cases users were no longer using xsede.
   * Created Jira tickets for !IdP and Banned VOMS server.
   * Emailed Soichi with my !IdP/SP install doc.
   * Time to start security controls assessment. Hope to get questionnaires out in twiki page form this week.
   * Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0 when ready.
