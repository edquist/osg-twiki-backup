---+ Aims
This drill is intended to 
   * improve collaboration between OSG site and security team
   * familiarize sites with security incident handling procedures
   * test reporting procedures
   * try out forensics processes

---+ Important Information for Participating Sites
   * Sanctions should not be applied against the VO used to submit the test job in the security drill.
   * OSG sites should send or cc osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org on emails relating to the drill instead of security@opensciencegrid.org.

---+ Scenario: Stolen Credentials
This drill will simulate a stolen credentials incident. Stolen credentials could be used to launch unwanted jobs. Banning the credentials can be done at several levels.
   * CA: The issuing CA can ban the dn, and it will be added to their crl. updates can take several hours to several days to propagate.
   * VOMS: The issuing VO can ban the dn in their voms server, which will prevent new proxies from being issued, however jobs can continue to be started for the life of any existing proxies.
   * GUMS/local controls: sites can ban the dn at their gums servers or via local gridmap files, and no new jobs will be started by the compromised credentials essentially immediately. Local site support is very important to security incident handling.

In this drill we will be focusing on GUMS/local control at the sites

---+ Site Response Expectations
---++ How to prepare
   * This is a simulation of a security incident, so familiarize yourself with the OSG security incident handling procedures at Documentation.IncidentDiscoveryReporting. 
   * OSG uses GOC ticketing system during the incidents. All communications with sites will be done via the tickets during the incident. Replying back to the email from the ticketing system will be sufficient. 

---++ Incident Response Procedure

---+++ SecurityTeam Incident Handling Checklist
[[IRSiteChecklist][Incident Response Site Checklist]]

Determine the type of incident:

   * Compromised machine
      * Do not turn machine off. There may be information security personnel may need that will be lost if the machine is shut down.
      * Do not delete any files. Do not wipe and re-install the system until the incident has been investigated.
      * Isolate the system. Disconnect the network from the system if possible, or block via firewalls.
      * Work with local security team to investigate the system.
   * Compromised credentials
      * Report dn as well as usernames to security team.
      * Block dn from system via GUMS or other local system. More info available at Documentation.Release3.BanningUsersAtSite

---+++ Information to be gathered by the site
The following information should be collected to start the investigation:
   * Network
      * Are there any suspicious connections open? To what remote ip's?
      * Are netflows or other network monitoring data available?
   * Containment
      * Does the process belong to a batch job or an interactive login?
      * Where was the job submitted from?
      * If a login, where was the login from?
      * In case of a grid job
         * Which VO is the user from?
         * Which DN's are involved?
         * When did the jobs start?

---+++ Response Evaluation
 Sites will be evaluated on two criteria:

   * Measurable per site operations:
      * initial feedback: 4h
      * find malicious jobs/processes and stop them 4h
      * ban problematic certificate 8h
      * Send network forensics and other job related information to osg-security-team 24h

Times will be measured from the time of initial alarm to the site.

---++ Target Sites
For this drill we basically targeted smaller OSG sites (preferably those who have not participated in a drill before.

   * SU-OG
   * Cornell
   * Michigan 
   * KSU 
   * Omaha 
   * NotreDame
   * FZU
   * Clemson 
   * OSC
   * Hyak_CE
   * TTU
   * SMU_HPC
