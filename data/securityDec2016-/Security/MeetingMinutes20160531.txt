---+ OSG Security Team Meetings

   * Meetings are normally every week on Tuesdays at 9:45 Chicago time. 
   * Phone: 866-740-1260 ID 8406490

---++ Dave
   * No security updates this week, focused on other things

---++ Jeny
   * OSG CA transition
      * Maria Dimou from CERN asked for updated links about the OSG CA and updated instructions for CMS users on how to get a certificate from OSG CA. According to the decisions taken during CMS transition to OSG CA last January, all CMS users must get certificates from CERN CA. She said that this decision did not take in consideration that there are users, who are not eligible for a CERN login and consequently, neither for a certificate issue by CERN CA, because they don't stay long enough at CERN.
         * I contacted Dave Mason to ask about this specific case and he says all CMS users must get a CERN account, no matter what.
      * First draft of contingency plan is finished. Jim Basney sent some answers and take a quick look. Ready to be reviewed: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CILogonContingencyPlan2016
      * Received report from GOC that DigiCert API is not working for revocation requests. Revocations need to be performed manually by DigiCert on their end. Issue is being tracked in ticket: https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/29954
   * OSG Operations
      * Received report of some sites running dCache can have inappropriate configuration which expose them to remote data deletion.
         * One dCache node was found exposed after some basic testing: fndca3a.fnal.gov. I sent notification to Fermilab Security Team, Gene Oleynik and Dmitry Litvintsev.
         * Arthur Lee sent results from a port scan done for port 1111 over TCP and UDP: A list of dCache nodes accepting connections on this port.
         * Gene Oleynik reported that this port was already being blocked. However, the hosts were still accepting connections over the mentioned port. He later found that the IPtables were being managed for a script and Puppet at the same time. 
         * May 27th: all hosts reported by Arthur Lee are not reachable from off-site.
         * Announcement sent to OSG Security Contacts on May 25th. The announcement was delayed because EGI and dCache asked us to coordinate our announcement with theirs.  
         * OIM ticket related to the announcement: https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30016
         * Brent Draney from NERSC asked if the proposed solution for dCache incorrect configuration was only reducing the remote exploit to a local exploit. OSG Security Team is aware that the proposed solution is mitigating the risk and that an insider attack can be performed. Actually, the recommended configuration from dCache documentation says that access over the port 11111 should be restricted to the dCache instances/nodes in the cluster. We know that dCache developers are working on a stronger solution, but there are compatibility requirements that can delay the implementation. 
      * Summary for Potential security issue with HDFS installations at US-CMS T2 sites added to Software Vulnerabilities Report 2016: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SoftwareVulnerability2016
      * Started Risk Assessment 2016 and Security Controls Assessment 2016.
   * Fermilab Security
      * After checking with Ed Simmonds the proposed solution, he agreed on implementing it in the system space. He requested a Service Ticket open for each experiment. I'm contacting the experiments liaisons to have the production coordinator of each experiment submitting the request. 
   * Cybersecurity Research
      * I keep working on paper proposals regarding innovative authentication and access control mechanisms for the Grid. I have chose new research papers to read.

---++ Anand
  *  Started the preparation for security drill, will select 10 sites for targeting the testing. Will needs Jeny's help sending jobs to the site. I will coordinate the drill.
