   * *Severity*: High  
   * *Urgency*: Immediate 

---++ Mitigation Plan
   * T2_US_MIT -Administrator: Maxim Goncharov-: Off-site access has been removed. Tried accessing the URL given at the proof-of-concept, not accesible anymore.
   * T2_US_Purdue -Administrator: Manoj Kumar-: Confirmed that off-site access has been removed. 
   * T2_US_Wisconsin -Administrator: Ajit Kumar and Dan Bradley-: Confirmed that off-site access was removed. Tried accessing the URL given at the proof-of-concept, not accesible anymore.
   * T2_US_Caltech -Administrator: Wayne Hendricks-: Caltech had an Unknown status at Brian's initial assessment. The admin confirmed that their Hadoop hosts have only local non-routable IPs.  The only way to access files in Hadoop from outside our internal VLAN is through Gridftp or xRootd. Caltech were configured correctly.
