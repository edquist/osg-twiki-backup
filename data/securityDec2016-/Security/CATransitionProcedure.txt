---+ OSG CA Transition Procedure
The OSG CA was designed with a modular backend, so different backend CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to transfer signing to a new backend CA.

---++ Prerequisites
   * OSG OIM modified to allow selecting which backend CA will sign cert requests for that VO.
   * Testing procedure completed.
   * New backend CA signed user certs will still have the same numeric suffix.

---++ Timeline
   * Convert friendly VO to use new backend CA - 1 month
      * pre-populate VOMS server. - vo admins - 1 day
      * Switch OIM to use new backend VO. - osg operations - 1 day
      * Get new user and host certs for admins and servers. - vo admins - 1 week
      * Coordinate switch of VO host cert with release of vomses and lsc files. - osg operations - 2 weeks
      * Verify users and grid admins are able to successfully use new certificates - vo - 2 weeks
   * After first VO is verified successful, coordinate and repeat with other VOs.

---++ Steps to transition
   * Ask VO to transition and pick date to swtichover.
   * Before the switch date, have VO's VOMS admins add cert DNs from new backend CA to existing users in their VOMS server.
   * Switch VO in OIM to get certs from new backend CA.
   * Have admins in new VO get new user and host certs for initial systems to verify everything is working. Identify systems dependent on host/service cert DNs and update as needed.
   * Users and admins get new certs as old certs expire.
