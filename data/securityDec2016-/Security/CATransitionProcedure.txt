---+ OSG CA Transition Procedure
The OSG CA was designed with a modular backend, so different backend CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to transfer signing to a new backend CA.

---++ Prerequisites
   * OSG OIM modified to allow selecting which backend CA will sign cert requests for that VO.
   * Testing procedure completed.
   * New backend CA signed user certs will still have the same numeric suffix.
   * Procedure to pre-populate VOMS servers will be distributed to VO admins ahead of time.

---++ Timeline
   * Convert friendly VO to use new backend CA - _5 weeks_
      * pre-populate VOMS server. - vo admins - _1 day_
         * OSG Security will provide a script to pre-populate personal DNs for new DNs for existing VOMS users.
      * Switch OIM to use new backend for this VO. - osg operations - _1 day_
      * Get new user and host certs for admins and servers. - vo admins - _1 week_
         * This would include any web servers using grid certificates for their service certificate, or accepting grid certificates for client authentication, like !DocDB.
      * Coordinate the new certificates with the release of vomses and lsc files. - osg operations - _2 weeks_
      * Verify users and grid admins are able to successfully use new certificates - vo - _2 weeks_
   * After first VO is verified successful, coordinate and repeat with second and third wave of VOs.
   * each wave is expected to take 5 weeks. 

---++ Schedule
|  | *VO* | *Start Date* | *End Date* | *Notes*|
| 1 | Fermilab | | | Fermilab is a good first choice, as system adminstrators are readily available, and being one of the more complex sites should expose any problems early. |
