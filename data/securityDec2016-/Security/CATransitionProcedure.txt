---+ OSG CA Transition Procedure
The OSG CA was designed with a modular backend, so different backend CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to transfer signing to a new backend CA.

---++ Prerequisites
   * The new Certificate Subscriber Agreement is put into production
   * OSG OIM modified to allow selecting which backend CA will sign cert requests for that VO.
   * Testing procedure completed.
   * New backend CA signed user certs will still have the same numeric suffix.
   * Procedure to pre-populate VOMS servers will be distributed to VO admins ahead of time.
   * VO client package is updated with the new VOMS service certificates a month before the VOMS server transitions and OSG community deployed the new client.
   * Any host certificate which need SANs must be generated by the OSG security team. The requestor must contact Mine/Neha/Jeny. The command line clients allowing SAN will come out in Jan 15 2016. Send an announcement to the VOs transitioning prior to that date.  

---++ General Info
   * CILogon OSG CA cert available in IGTF bundle 1.69 and OSG Software release (starting 3.2.29 and 3.3.3) 
   * Mine sent announcement to OSG about updating new OSG CA bundle on nodes and browsers
   * XSEDE confirmed that they installed the OSG CA certificate from the IGTF release
   * Diego@CERN confirmed that all CMS web services have the CILogon OSG CA cert

---++ Steps to Take a Transition a VO
   1. 1 month before the transition. Ask GOC for a list of all expiring certs from that VO.  
   2. 1 month before the transition date. Identify if the VO has standalone VOMS server. If it does: 
      a. Email the VOMS Administrator and asked them to obtain a new service certificate for VOMS. They do not need to install the new cert in VOMS server until the transition date, but we need to put the DN into VO Client package. 
      b. Give the script that pre-populates the VOMS server with new user DNs to VOMS Administrator and explain how it works. Script attached below to pre-populate personal DNs for new DNs for existing VOMS users must be run on a machine that can connect to the voms mysql database. Uses -hhostname -uusername -ppassword databasename arguments similar to mysql client. 
   3. 1 month before the transition. Contact the VO Managers and alert them about the upcoming change. They should send out an announcement to their community. Use the template announcement written by Neha. It should ask everyone to update their CA bundle and VO Client package. 
   4. 1 month before the transition. Alert GOC that the VO is transitioning. Re-Confirm the transition date. 
   5. If the VO is a certificate-only VO, no jobs running, they most likely will not have any VOMS server. Skip steps 2, 6, 7, 8. 
   6. 8 days before OSG Software Release Date. Send the new VOMS server cert DN to OSG GOC team (Kyle). GOC team will create the new VO client package and send this to OSG Software team. Skip this step and the next step if the VO does not have a standalone VOMS server or the VOMS server already have a new cert. 
   7. Check the OSG software release and confirm new client packages are released
   8. If the VO has multiple VOMS servers, make a note of when the other VOMS server will be upgraded to the new OSG CILogon CA cert. 
   9. 1 week before the transition. Confirm with the VO manager that we are undergoing transition. 
   10. 1 week before the transition. Check GOC is ready to switch this VO in production.
   11. 2 weeks after the transition. Keep monitoring the VO for possible problems.

There are even some sites that don't use any of the OSG infrastructure at all.)  I've informed the site admins via the HN, but I'm sure there will be some sites caught by surprise, and we'll just have to deal with that as it comes up.|
