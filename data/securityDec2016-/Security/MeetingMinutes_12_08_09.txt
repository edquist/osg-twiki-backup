---++Meeting Minutes 12/08/09
*Igor*
   * bestman cache review : 30 minute caching is default. site admin can set it to
any time. when admin needs to clean the cache, he should reset the bestman.
   * do we need caching for prima? or glexec? there was a discussion at
fermilab, but never had effort. prima on gatekeeper is not a big deal. glexec on WN may be a problem. but on average the answer is no there is not a pressing need. 
   * testing glexec
      * cms asked testing glexec over everywhere on lhc. 
      * cms never used glexec in production. production --> single user . analysis --> multi user pilot jobs. 
      * if atlas wants to test or not? so far no.
      * Igor will do it as a member of osg security team for cms.
      * frank mentions testing t1-t2 and t3. why t3s are needed? 
      * test whether a site that claims supportign glexec really runs it, whether configured properly
      * will need a procedure in place to test it. we may use RSV probes. Anand could help with writing the probe. on W, glexec_location variable should be set. the test job will try to run glexec. anybody can run glexec. the caveat is the invoker of glexec should also present the second proxy that he likes to switch to.  there is nothing different for the pilot job.
      * deadline is by the end of january.

*Doug*
   * passing the monitoring database to GOC. talked to Arvind about VM at GOC. tell them exactly how it will work and
give Arvind a VM ware image to see how it works.
   * debian ca package. issue with debian tools. sites have to install manually until apt repository is ready.

*Anand*
   * vdt-update-certs should validate signatures. would it do that off-the-bat. should we change the code? 
   * *Action Item* send me the redundant risks today. 
   * mcas?
   * Anand takes over Jim's vulnerability duty.

*Igor*
   * sent two low risk vulnerabilities. 
   * openldap MITM , java caching problem is broken & arbitray code execution. 
   * *Action Item* : Anand and Mine will review the vulnerabilities.
