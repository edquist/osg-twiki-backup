---++ Meeting Minutes 04/29/2008


Ron was on furlough last week.  
he finished reviewing the security plan. we discuss the ownership of physical assets and how this is handled
in osg security plan. controls such as physical access control, scanning, vulnerability detection may not be 
effectively achieved. 

Action Items: osg vo aup and registration policy is submitted to doc db. Ron will review them. Security
policies and procedure table needs updating in the status column. 
 

Doug: discussed with Arvind how to securely POST an incidet report. 

Action Item: (Doug/Jim) Once Rob Q comes back, we will have a meeting 
on this. may 10th is his return date, so roughly around that week. 

Jim: secure email communication.

Action item: Jim/Doug will ask Rob Q. footprints access requirements. who can access: which groups we should form to 
access incident tickets. incident response work area:
can we set up a space on twiki for putting out report logs. how can we manage access of OSG contacts to review info
based on their needs.  


We agreed pgp and s/mime is good for incident reporting and security advisories. This is a requirement to be 
fullfilled. We agreed pgp key expiration is a significant advantage because even with expired PGP keys 
decryption would always work.

Doug will create a twiki page on reviewing incident respons policy, will list the questions to ask
to site and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo security personnel, and list the log files needed by the site amdins to trace a security incident
