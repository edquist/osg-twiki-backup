   * Kyle is working on setting up a separate twiki web for the SecurityTeamWorkingArea, then plans to let me run the command to move things over.
   * Mine sent message asking about registering people's OSG CA DNs in OIM without tickets -- status?
   * WLCG Isolation: Brian B will be working with Andrew Melo over the next few weeks to make a tool that sets up an isolated container based on OS files in CVMFS and bind mounts (no union filesystem) and calling it from a glexec lcmaps plugin as root.  The tool is intended to also be able to be called as non-root on kernels that support user-mode mount namespaces (which is not expected in a RHEL release for at least another year).
   * I got a command line tool to work with the CERN Single Sign On -- webisoget.  I fixed a bug to get it to work at CERN, and also contributed a security improvement on the cookie file.  For each destination website it redirects to login.cern.ch where a certificate is accepted, then it returns cookies for that website that allow it to connect without redirects for the next 24 hours.
   * Can we make any progress on getting OSG-approved institutions into the CILogon Silver CA?
   * I made new cigetcert releases this week to support a reuseonly mode, which only verifies if an existing cert/proxy is good for reuse (including in myproxy) and will not try to get a new one.  The mode can be enabled as a runtime option or by making the existing cert/proxy file readonly.  At the same time, it no longer requires the DN to have a '/O=institution' matching the given institution name.  This feature is intended to support service certificates with jobsub.

   * Presented talk about OSG and Operational Security at WISE Workshop last Monday.
   * Working on Risk Assessment for HEPCloud. Almost finished with the last document version.
   * Trying new instructions from Software Team to submit jobs to specific CEs. This is needed for Anand's security drill.

---++ Anand
