---++ Execution of Security Plan
The security plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG Doc 398]])
is modeled after the NIST process for securing IT resources.  This is illustrated in the diagram below
from Irwin Gaines.

It has a periodic cycle of risk analysis, control definition, documentation and implementation, assessment
and monitoring.
The sections below are about the execution of the OSG security plan.

---+++ Security Categorization
The security categorization is contained in the "Computer Security Risk Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment for Core OSG," 
[[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=488][OSG Doc 488]].

---+++ Security Controls Documentation
The security controls documentation is contained in the "OSG Security Plan",
[[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG Doc 389]].

---+++ Security Control Assessment
The security control assessment performed in 2007 is shown at ControlsAssessment2007.

---+++ Update of Security Plan
As of early 2008 we have completed the first iteration of this process and are starting
the second pass which starts with a review of the Risk Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment and Security Categorization
and will continue to controls definition and documentation.  
The first pass on the process focussed only on the "core OSG" and in the second pass
we will include the connections to the security plans for OSG beyond the core, meaning
participating resources in OSG.
This plan and progress on this update are shown at
