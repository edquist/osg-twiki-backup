   * New vulnerability has been reported regarding Linux kernel privilege escalation. We received report from EGI: https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2016-5195 It consists on a race condition found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. It is referred as DirtyCOW. By exploiting this vulnerability, an unprivileged local user could gain access to read-only memory mappings and increase her privileges on the system. RedHat has not published security updates for affected OS versions yet. The CVE report appears as ongoing work.
   * Emails from OSG Operations Center are being flagged by FNAL Microsoft mail server: RITM0461052
