---++OSG PKI Transition Guidance for VOs

This document provides the overall guidance for VOs regarding the OSG PKI Transition. It describes the tasks that a VO should consider in order to perform a smooth transition. Although OSG provides documentation for end users and system administrators, there are still some tasks that are specific for a VO and should be decided and documented by the VO management. This document lists such VO-specific tasks and guides VOs to plan for such tasks.   

---+++ VO-Specific Tasks 

---++++ Tasks Related to Services/Hosts

   1 Identify the services that has a service and host certificate from DOEGrids CA. 
   2 Make a list of the expiration dates for the host/service certificates. It is very important that the system administrators will obtain new host/service certificates from OSG CA before the expiraton date. We suggest that replacement certificates from OSG CA should be obtained a month before the expiration date of the current certificates. 
   3 Identify the services that authorizes end users based on end user certificates. These services will have to register new user certificates as the users obtain new certificates from OSG CA. For example, for CMS VO we have a list of VOMS, GGUS ticketing system, CERN twikis and indico service, and various other services that all uses certificates to authorize users. 
   4 Encourage service operators to first build a test instance and perform the changes in the test instance.
   5 Direct service operators to OSG documentation on how to obtain host/service certificates. 
   5 Document the steps necessary for the services to register the new user certificates. Consider whether a service an and should register multiple certificates for a single user. Some services simply do not have the capability to do so. 
      4.1 In particular, we strongly recommend that VOMS+VOMRS server should not try to register multiple certificates for a single user account. Instead, the VOMS Admin should create a separate VOMS user account for each user certificate. This will resultThis is because the GUMS server version installed at most OSG sites cannot handle multiple certificates downloaded from a single user 

---++++End User Transition Tasks

end users will have to obtain new certificates as their existing certificates expire. Once obtained the new certificates, the users will have to register their new certificates with VO services that perform user authorization based on user certificates. It is crucial that the VO management identify all such services that does certificate-based authorization. The service operators should be informed that they need to register new user certificates. Also, end users should be alerted that they need to register their certificates with these services. Some services
