---++ Instructions for Agents

---+++ Processing OU=People certificate requests
   1 Email notification received by agents has name of VO in the subject line. 
      * E.g., *[doesg-ra] DOEGrids CA - OSG CMS Certificate Request in Queue (request id: NNNNN)* 
      * identifies OSG as the RA and CMS as the VO.
      * For a complete list of VOs see http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi?region=0&VO=0&res=0&grid=1. 
   1 An agent for the identified VO should follow the link in the email notice to see complete information about the request within one business day, and click the "assign to me" link to take ownership of the request when they have determined it is a request that the agent can process. 
   1 Using the additional information provided in the request the agent should determine who are acceptable sponsors that can validate the request. This may or may not be the same as the sponsor shown in the request. 
   1 Agent should contact the sponsor by email or telephone to confirm the request. 
      * Agent can accept confirmation by telephone directly, if using previously validated telephone number for the sponsor. 
      * If sponsor responds by email it must be digitally signed to verify the sponsors identity. 
   1 If sponsor confirms the certificate requestor by an acceptable means, the agent can issue the certificate. 
      * If the sponsor denies the requestor then the agent should reject the request. 
   1 Agent should record a summary of the verification (or rejection) of the request. This summary can be sent to osg-ra-log@opensciencegrid.org or to another archive maintained by the agent or VO. If a different archive is used the location of the archive should be communicated to the OSG RA. The recorded information should include 
      * Request identifier (for certification requests) 
      * Description of action take (approve, reject, cancel, revoke, etc.) 
      * Name and/or individual email address of Agent who processed the request. 
      * Name of Sponsor who confirmed the request (in some cases the Agent is also the Sponsor). 
      * For certification requests, statement of why the requestor qualifies to receive certificate, i.e., membership in a particular VO, or association with a science program participating with OSG. 
      * Certificate serial number 
      * Certificate subject name, i.e., DN 

---+++ Processing OU=Services certificate requests
   1 OU=Services requests will have the domain name of the host for which the certificate is requested in the subject line of the notification email. 
      * E.g., *[doesg-ra] DOEGrids CA - OSG hep.olemiss.edu Certificate Request in Queue (request id: NNNNN)* 
      * shows OSG as the RA and hep.olemiss.edu as the domain name for a request with 
         * DN = CN=sam/umiss000.hep.olemiss.edu,OU=Services,DC=doegrids,DC=org 
 
   1 An agent with responsibility for the domain should click on the link in the email notice to check the complete information for the request within one business day of receiving the notice. 
   1 If the agent is able to process the request agent should click the "assign to me" link to take ownership of the request. 
   1 If the requestor has a valid DOEGrids personal certificate then agent can issue the certificate. 
   1 If the requestor does not have a valid DOEGrids personal certificate then they need to be authenticated as described for a personal certificate request above before issuing the new certificate. 
   1 Agent should record a summary of the verification (or rejection) of the request. This summary can be sent to osg-ra-log@opensciencegrid.org or to another archive maintained by the agent or VO. If a different archive is used the location of the archive should be communicated to the OSG RA. The recorded information should include 
      * Request identifier (for certification requests) 
      * Description of action take (approve, reject, cancel, revoke, etc.) 
      * Name and/or individual email address of Agent who processed the request. 
      * Name of Sponsor who confirmed the request (in some cases the Agent is also the Sponsor). Not needed if requestor has a valid personal certificate. 
      * For certification requests, statement of why the requestor qualifies to receive certificate, i.e., membership in a particular VO, or association with a science program participating with OSG. 
      * Certificate serial number 
      * Certificate subject name, i.e., DN 

---+++ Becoming an Agent with the OSG RA
 *Step 1.* To become an Agent with the OSG RA so that you are able to process certificate requests for the purpose of issuing certificate for your community you should first communicate the interest and needs for certificates with the OSG RA Point of Contact (Doug Olson), <a href="mailto:osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org">osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org</a>

*Step 2.* If appropriate, the OSG RA POC will invite you (informally) to become an agent for your VO.

*Step 3.* You then send the email message described below.

*Step 4.* The OSG RA POC confirms your request for Agent privilege with DOEGrids.

*Step 5.* The DOEGrids CA managers grant Agent privilege based on your personal certificate and you start receiving email notifications of all new certificate requests. You process the requests from your VO according to the instructions above.

*Step 6.* If you don't get a response in 3 business days please send a reminder email asking about the status of your request.

---++++ Letter requesting new or renewed agent access
 Agents for DOEGrids (OSG, and all other RAs) are required to send an email letter requesting authorization for agent access at least once per year, digitally signed with the certificate that will be authorized for access. The RA must also send a confirmation letter to approve the request for agent access. Below is the example letter for agents (from Appendix A of the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf][CP/CPS]]) with the OSG RA. In this letter you should specify which VOs registered with OSG you will handle certificate requests for. See the [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi?region=0&VO=0&res=0&grid=1][OSG VORS]] for a list of the VOs registered with OSG.

%BLUE% To: doegrids-ca-1@doegrids.org

Cc: osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org

Dear DOEGRids Operations:

I %ENDCOLOR% %RED% [your name] %ENDCOLOR% %BLUE% request to be as an Agent of the Registration Authority for OSG. I have been authorized by OSG and the following VOs (%ENDCOLOR% %RED% list your VOs here %ENDCOLOR% %BLUE% ) to represent them for the purposes of approving/revoking DOEGrids certificates in our community. I have read and agree to the following clauses:

   1 In acting as the Agent of the RA for OSG I have read, understood and accept the responsibilities and tasks assigned to an Agent as laid out in the DOEGrids CP/CPS. http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf. 
   1 I understand that DOEGrids Certification Service will notify me by email of changes to CP/CPS and I will immediately notify the DOEGrids PMA if I am no longer willing to act as an Agent for my RA under any new CP/CPS. 
   1 I understand that failure to fulfill my responsibilities and tasks under this agreement may result in the termination of my appointment as a Agent for OSG. 
   1 I agree only to act on enrollment requests associated with the OSG. 
   1 I understand that I am responsible for the revocation of certificates that are suspected of being compromised or issued in violation of the DOEGrids CP/CPS policies. 
   1 I understand that I am responsible for customer support for the OSG VOs shown above, related to DOEGrids certificate issuance, revocation and information. 

%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Letter requesting !GridAdmin privilege
 The !GridAdmin interface to the DOEGrids CA allows site administrators to be authorized to submit service certificate requests, authenticated with their personal certificate, and have the signed service certificate issued immediately. !GridAdmin is available both as a [[http://www.doegrids.org/Library/gridAdmin/gridAdminUser.html][web interface]] and from the cert-gridadmin [[CertScriptsPackage][script]]. To request this privilege, you should familiarize yourself with the Subscriber Obligations (Section 2.1.2) and Grid Admins (Section A.3.4) of the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf][DOEGrids CP/CPS]]. Then you should send the following letter as email, digitally signed with your personal certificate to the OSG RA.

%GREEN% To: osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org

Dear OSG RA,

I %ENDCOLOR% %RED% [your name] %ENDCOLOR% %GREEN% would like to be a Grid admin for OSG. I would like to be authorized to request and approve DOEGrids Service certificates for the following name space(s):

   1 FQDN 1 or range of addresses for a particular domain<br /> b. FQDN 2<br /> c. others

   1 As the Grid Admin for OSG I have read and understand the responsibilities and tasks assigned to a Grid Admin as laid out in the DOEGrids CP/CPS. http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf. 
   1 I agree that as Grid Admin I will only submit and approve Service certificates for the FQDNs listed above. 
   1 I understand that I am responsible for the revocation of certificates that are suspected of being compromised or issued in violation of the DOEGrids CP/CPS policies. 

%ENDCOLOR%

You should receive a response within three business days and if not you should send another email asking about the status of your request.

---+++ Allowable Requests

From Section 1.3.3 of the DOEGrids CP/CPS:<br /> 
%BLUE% DOE GRIDS PKI issues Person, Host and Service certificates to scientists, engineers, graduate students, and others working on Department of Energy Scientific Research programs as allowed in the ESnet AUP ([[http://es.net/hypertext/esnet-aup.html][http://es.net/hypertext/esnet-aup.html]]), or as allowed by the DOE Office of Science in support of DOE collaborations with other agencies and institutions. The person requesting and responsible for a certificate's private key is the subscriber. 
%ENDCOLOR%

This includes members of or persons affiliated with all VOs registered with Open Science Grid, with some exceptions ([[#Not_Allowable_Requests][see below]]). One a case by case basis, the OSG RA may issue certificates to persons not affiliated with a VO registered with OSG but who qualifies under the general DOEGrids policy shown above.

If an agent is in doubt about whether or not a particular request is allowed (s)he should contact the OSG RA (osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org) for clarification.

---+++ Not Allowable Requests for OSG RA agents

Members of VOs that are participants in the LCG and are employed in European countries are generally required to get their certificates for use in LCG from one of the European CAs. In order to accommodate this efficiently, Agents should normally process _OU=People_ requests only for email addresses that end in *.gov* or *.edu*, and _OU=Services_ requests with hostnames that end in *.gov* or *.edu*. All other requests should be referred to osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org. Handling of special circumstances, such as SAM service certificates for DZero, will be worked out with the individual Agents processing those requests.

Employees and guests at certain DOE laboratories that have their own RA with DOEGrids require that those persons get certificates via their own RA's. This includes Argonne National Lab and Oakridge National Lab.

Requests from persons who are residents or citizens of the U.S. State Department T-6 countries (Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria) possibly do not qualify to receive a DOEGrids certificate. All requests for persons from these countries should be forwarded to the OSG RA (osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org) for processing.

The exceptions above are not an exhaustive list of cases where subscribers do not qualify to receive a certificate. If an agent is in doubt about whether or not a particular request is allowed (s)he should contact the OSG RA (osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org) for clarification.

---+++ Other Agent Actions
 The main URL at the CA for actions authorized for Agents is https://pki1.doegrids.org:8100/ca/. The most frequently used actions are searching for certificates, and revocation. Any action causing changes (revocation, issuing certificates, granting privileges, etc.) should be recorded by sending an email describing the action to osg-ra-log@opensciencegrid.org.

---+++ Termination of Agent or Grid Admin privileges
 When you wish to terminate any Agent or Grid Admin privileges you have, due to change of job or responsibilities you should send an email (preferably with digital signature) to osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org stating that you are ending your responsibilities and privileges. You should state who, if anyone, is taking over for your Agent or Grid Admin responsibilities. When Agents terminate their privileges there need to be arrangements made to transfer the log of Agent actions to another Agent or to the OSG RA. If the Agent has logged all actions to the osg-ra-log@opensciencegrid.org email archive then no additional transfer is necessary.

---++ Instructions for Sponsors
 A _Sponsor_ for a certificate request is a person who can confirm that a _subscriber_ has made a certificate request based on reliable personal knowledge, such as face-to-face or telephone discussion with the subscriber who is personally known to the Sponsor. 
   * A sponsor should have an X509 personal certificate issued by one of the [[http://www.gridpma.org/][IGTF]] accredited CAs. 
   * DIgitally signed email is the prefered method of communication between agent and sponsor. 

---++ Instructions for Users
---+++ Install CA certificates into your browser
 In order for your web browser to "trust" a particular certification authority (CA) the certificate for that CA must first be installed in your web browser and be marked as trusted for some types of operations. In order to "trust" the DOEGrids CA, point your browser at https://www.tacar.org/repos/, and click the Install button next to the ESnet Root CA.

---+++ [[CertScriptsPackage][Certificate Scripts package]]
 This package of command-line utilities (click heading above), included as part of a VDT or OSG software installation, provides a convenient interface for requesting new and replacement certificates as well as checking the lifetime of certificates & CRLs and searching the DOEGrids certificate directory.

---+++ Digitally signed email
 Most modern email clients can handle smime (digitally signed) email messages without difficulty once your certificate is loaded into the certificate store for the email client.

However, it is also possible to digitally sign messages from a command-line using openssl and your grid certificate .pem files (typically ~/.globus/user{cert|key}.pem).

Example sending signed email:
<verbatim>
$ openssl smime -sign -signer ~/.globus/usercert.pem -inkey ~/.globus/userkey.pem            
         -in message.txt | mail -s "email subject" person@example.com
</verbatim>

   * message.txt - body of the email message 
   * ~/.globus/usercert.pem, userkey.pem - your personal grid certificate 
   * person@example.com - address where email is to be sent 

Example verifying signed message:
<verbatim>
$ openssl smime -verify -in message.txt  -CApath $X509_CERT_DIR
</verbatim>

   * message.txt - body of email message received. 
      * note that the line beginning "Content-Type" and including 'boundary="---' must be a single line and not get broken or wrapped. 
   * note that there is an openssl smime option ( -noverify ) which avoids the need for specifying the trusted CA directory path, but this should only be used if you have a good reason to believe that the senders certificate is still valid. 

Example verifying signed message and examining the signer's certificate:
<verbatim>
$ openssl smime -verify -in message.txt -CApath $X509_CERT_DIR -signer sendercert.pem
$ openssl x509 -in sendercert.pem -noout -subject -email -serial -dates
</verbatim>

   * message.txt - body of email message received 
   * sendercert.pem - the certificate used by the sender to sign the message, is extracted with the openssl smime command 
   * openssl x509 command above will display the subject, email address, serial number and validity dates of the signer's certificate 

---+++ Make .pem files for globus after exporting PKCS12 file from your web browser.
 Extract your certificate (which contains the public key) and the private key:

   * Certificate: 
      * openssl pkcs12 -in my-cert.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem 
   * To get the encrypted private key : 
      * openssl pkcs12 -in my-cert.p12 -nocerts -out $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem 
 You must set the protections on your .pem files correctly, otherwise grid-proxy-init will not use them. 
   * chmod go-rw ~/.globus/userkey.pem 
   * chmod go-r ~/.globus/usercert.pem 

---+++ Make PKCS12 file from .pem files for import to web browser
 To import your grid certificate into a web browser it usually needs to be put into a PKCS12 format file. The example below is the openssl command to generate this file form your default grid certificate files, ~/.globus/usercert.pem and ~/.globus/userkey.pem. 
<verbatim>
openssl pkcs12 -inkey ~/.globus/userkey.pem -in ~/.globus/usercert.pem
              -export -out my-cert.p12
</verbatim> 
You will have to enter the passphrase used to encrypt your private key (userkey.pem) as well as another passphrase to encrypt the .p12 file. This .p12 file (my-cert.p12) can be imported to your web browser, see your web browser help information on how to do this.

---+++ Verify that private key matches public certificate
 The md5 digest strings of these two commands must match in order to verify that the private key and public certificate match. 
   * openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in usercert.pem | openssl md5 
   * openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in userkey.pem | openssl md5 

If your certificate and key file have names different than usercert.pem and userkey.pem just substitute the actual names of your files. If the private key is encrypted you will be prompted to enter the passphrase. This comparison work for any type of certificate/key pair, personal, host, service, etc.

---+++ Web Browser specific information
 Here are links to helpful information for different web browsers and certificate issues.

---++++ InternetExplorer
---++++ Contributions from others?

---++ Work Plan
