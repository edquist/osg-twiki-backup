   * ECP !IdP requirements document finished, Olga is working on implementing Kerberos support
   * Jim Basney says cilogon can put in the email address in the Subject right after the first and last name instead of a random number; is that what we want?
   * Who uses the list translating user names to DNs, anybody?
   * Updated KCA replacement high level design drawing/document with Jeny; Jeny is doing some format cleanup
   * Agreed to implement signing of external repository .cvmfswhitelist files, deploy October 13
   * GOC working on new certificate for repo.grid.iu.edu so osg-release rpm can be installed with https.  They know what to do, because oim.grid.iu.edu has a cert recognized by wget even though the CA is "/C=US/ST=MI/L=Ann Arbor/O=Internet2/OU=InCommon/CN=InCommon RSA Server CA", the same CA as repo.grid.iu.edu but with a different trust chain.
