The VO manager shows up in the OIM is European contacts. if the local contacts at UCSD cannot answer, Alain will contact the Vo managers at Europe who are listed in OIM.

Burt asked specifically which institutes and the circumstances. Thomas has not replied yet. We will let Thomas and Burt decide between themselves. 
   * Some of William's requests are still taking a bit long. He informs Alain of what is going on. William provides good logs about approval and refusals. however, we do not know if he follows the process we laid out on the twiki. In his inquiries, Alain refers to the process steps and asks William where he is at the process. Alain does not get answers related to the process. 
   * Jeff Dutton wanted to renew his Agent privileges. The process requires his VO manager to approve the request. The manager has not responded for two weeks. Mine OK'ed to renew the request not to delay serving the certificate requests. 
   * TODO: Alain will email DOEgrids ca directly on the issue of working with a team if RA backups. At the moment DOEgrids only accept approval and refusal requests form Alain and Mine's personal email accounts. When Alain is not available, Kyle or other backups are not able to send agent approval refusal requests. We want to set up a shared email lists where only RA backups can post and we want this list to be recognized by DOEgrids CA. 
   * TODO: Alain will continue with general informational meetings with agents. the goal of the meetings is to listen to the problems agents have and understand how they follow the processes laid out.
