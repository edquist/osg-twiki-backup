Attendees: Ron, Rob, Jim, Doug<br /><br />Policy documents are missing from OIM registration. Rob took care of it. OIM refers to OSG AUP and the Service Agreement<br /> <br />SecurityTeam team access to OIM. The security team will send a list of which info they would like access to in OIM. <br /><br />People marking their data as public or private in OSG. 3 levels : whole world , osg community, osg staff. OSG staff will see everything. OSG community will see information marked<br />for viweing by other OSG members (non-staff members). Whole world means that data can be googled. <br /><br /><br />We need to register OSG core assets into OIM. Rob thinks we must do this per asset. We will wait until Rob adds new resource types such as services. <br /> <br />Jim will generate a PGP key for OSG security team and send this to Rob<br /><br />Doug:proc mail filter . ca software. discussed with Mike: agent logs of id vetting outside of esnet operations itself. osg agent logs are in the email lists. osg ra log: where is it kept? <br />osg-ra-log@opensciengrid.org , logs are agent responsibility. not all, almost. who is responsible if there is a mistake? RA and CA log separation. we still keep osg-ra-logs ? or add esnet <br />goc keeps separate log email lists. <br /><br />email lists: ad-hoc group of people. we can cc them. we do not want uninvolved sites to see incident discussion.
