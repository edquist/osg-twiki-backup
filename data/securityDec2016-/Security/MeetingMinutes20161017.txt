   * Jim Basney reported reported that some users were getting certificates too often.  We tracked it down to Nova's common scripts, and Alex Himmel redid them to match the current tools.  He had some power users testing it out last week.  Alex expects it to be rolled out this week.
   * A CDF user was having trouble submitting jobs.  There were two problems: (1) his submit machine still had KCA kx509 installed,  and Ken got that fixed by requesting that it be updated.  (2) his DN was the wrong format.  cilogon found the bug because his registered email address was not @fnal.gov, which they say they'll fix this Wednesday; meanwhile Ken registered the users current DN in VOMS.  The user jobs were still failing, but today they started working, I assume because a KCA cert somewhere expired and got overwritten.  I still don't fully understand how cigetcert could try to access the KCA DN with a cilogon cert while storing, I need to figure that out.
   * Made cigetcert versions 1.12, 1.13, and 1.14 to restore a line of code dropped in 1.11, write temporary file to same directory as output file, and  limit the number of proxy levels accepted to 5 deep.  1.14 is now the current version in the fermilab UPS for el5, el6, and el7.
   * I made a CVMFS ticket for reproducing the kernel crash with singularity+overlayfs+cvmfs.
   * singularity-2.2 has been released with Brian's patch.  I made a patch for changing the home directory inside the container, which hasn't been included yet.
   * CHEP was good.  There wasn't a specific discussion on the security track of the HEP community white paper; that has to be separately organized by track members.  A few tracks did organize a quick meeting of interested people, but nobody organized one for security.  I learned a few interesting security-related things: (1) CERN Security is in discussion with the VOMS developers to add Single Sign On support to VOMS-admin rather than certificate access, which we also need for DCAFI phase II.  (2) The CERN IdP supports ECP.  (3) In a conversation Predrag Buncic said the way to handle storage authentication when you can't trust the worker node (e.g. for BOINC) the way to handle it is to create a random directory name on your storage server, make it write-only by everybody, and pass that to the job.  Then afterward another process comes through and moves the data out of that directory to its real storage location.  I'm thinking this could solve the problem in general of sending certificates to jobs, once we don't need the certs for glexec.

   * There were no new vulnerabilities affecting OSG Software stack.
   * Anand and I found an issue with one of the CAs distributed in IGTF 1.78, the CRL verification for UNLPGrid  was failing. UNLPGrid is in the process of re-generating its root certificate and extending the validity period. The CA certificate in IGTF 1.78 was not updated to the most recent one. A new CRL has been published (with the old CA certificate) and verification is passing without issues.
   * Security training was conducted for project8 and miniclean VOs. Zalak conducted the training, I served as backup for questions.
   * Completed the HEPCloud Risk Assessment document and uploaded it to Fermipoint.
      * Reading about Google Cloud IAM and security practices.
   * Met with Zalak to start OSG Risk Assessment.

   * OSG 1.58 CA package was made and released for testing to OSG Software Team.
      * Found an issue with IGTF 1.77, caused to to an expired CA. Contacted IGTF and they made a new release (IGTF 1.78) with the offending certificate removed
      * Found an issue with one of the CAs distributed in IGTF 1.78, the CRL verification for UNLPGrid  was failing. UNLPGrid is in the process of re-generating its root certificate and extending the validity period. A new CRL has been published (with the old CA certificate) and verification is passing without issues.
   * Can now submit jobs to a number of OSG sites via osg-connect
