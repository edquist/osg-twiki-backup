Attending: Jim and Doug

Mine and Ron are at a DOE Cyber Security Meeting.

Doug: Not getting a response from the dcache team on proxy cleanup questions. Will ask Mine for help.

Jim: Trying to reproduce gsissh eScience certificate issue reported by LIGO. No success yet reproducing the inconsistent behavior.

Doug is on vacation the rest of the week.

Jim and Doug talked some about using Aladdin eTokens for secure private key storage. Doug is ordering one. Jim has one but isn't using it -- hasn't gotten it to work on his Mac yet.
