---+ OSG Registration Authority plans
We have planned, in the OSG Program of Work and subsequent proposals to establish a Registration Authority with [[http:?/www.doegrids.org][DOEGrids]] for OSG. Initialy this RA will replace the functions of the PPDG and iVDGL RA's as those projects (& funding) come to a close. This page will be used to publish and maintain the workplan for putting the OSG RA into effect.

---++ Overview
The general idea for the functions of the OSG RA is to have the initial service essentially just be a re-labelling of the PDPG and iVDGL procedures as the OSG procedures for the startup of the OSG RA.
We should also plan the evolution of the OSG RA service and guidance & interaction with DOEGrids for the longer term.

---+++ Purpose
The purpose of the OSG RA is to provide the authentication function for X509 certificate requests from users of OSG for personal or service certificates issued by the DOEGrids CA.  The definition of the scope and function for an RA is defined in the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf][DOEGrids CP/CPS]].

---++ Significant dates
---+++ May 1, 2006
About May 1 the DOEGrids PMA will have a quarterly meeting and we intend to have an appendix for the CP/CPS covering the OSG RA ready for consideration and approval at that meeting.

---+++ July 1, 2006
OSG RA should be functional.

---++ To Do Items
	1. Prepare Draft OSG RA appendix for DOEGrids - due April 15?
		* will describe plan and procedures for agents and sponsors for the distributed OSG RA.
		* a goal is to distribute as much of the RA function as possible consistent with maintaining the integrity and operational performance goals of the RA
		* Who from OSG should approve the OSG appendix? The EB?

---++ Wishlist
	* Display OSG-registered VOs on the certificate request web page (pki1.doegrids.org).
	* Modify cert request notification email to agents to include VO name.
	* Include identification of RA agents and/or sponsors with the OSG Operations VO/Resoruce/Support Center registration procedure.
	* Revocation script
