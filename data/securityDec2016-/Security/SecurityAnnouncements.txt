---++ Security Announcements

The GOC has a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/notify?security][web form at ticket.grid.iu.edu]]
which is used to open a security ticket and optionally also send an email announcement
to security contacts registered in OIM for resources, VOs and support centers (you choose which groups you want to send to).
The message portion of the form should contain text which is PGP signed with the security@opensciencegrid.org key.
At present (June 2009) everyone registered with OIM is authorized to view the contents of the security tickets
but people without their client certificate and DN registered with OIM will not be ale to see the contents.
(What about other Footprints users?).
