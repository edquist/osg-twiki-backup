*Anand*: 
   * Still having cert issues with docdb. 
   * Couple options for cilogon rpm. possibly make fermilab version available. need to double check update behavior for config file.
   * Looking into top 10 sites. Gratia doesn't seem to have something directly. Might be easiest to manually combine top CE's into sites.

*Kevin*:
   * Writing up executive summary for security controls assessment.
