   * implemented cigetcert storing proxy in MyProxy, and implemented --minhours option which reuses valid proxy if there are enough hours left in the /tmp/x509 proxy and in the MyProxy server.
      * want to do a little code refactoring before calling it done
   * next need to investigate converting pyOpenSSL use to only m2crypto, and write a man page before packaging for ups/upd

   * Finish testing for osg-pki-tools: osg-request and osg-gridadmin-request worked fine with multiple alternative names.
