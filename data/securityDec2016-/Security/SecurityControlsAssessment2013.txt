---+ 2 Security Controls Assessment 2013

---++ 2.1 Overview

---++ 2.2 Management Controls

---+++ 2.2.1 Integrated Computer Security Management

---++++ 2.2.1.1 Roles and Responsibilities - Line Organization
   * Changed review interval from 6 months to 1 year.
   * *The org chart in docdb OSG-doc-314 is out of date.*

---++++ 2.2.1.2 Awareness for OSG managers
   * Awareness materials containing necessary information for OSG Managers: OSG Document 573 provides relevant information.
   * The awareness material needs minor updating. It is a very broad document that covers above and beyond awareness materials (60+ slides). It needs to be shorten before presented to area leads. A regular venue such as OSG AHM can be used to present the awareness materials to the area leads periodically. The control can be updated to also check how frequently the awareness training is given.
