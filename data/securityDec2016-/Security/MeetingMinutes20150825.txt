   * Made some good contacts and learned some interesting things at the NSF cybersecurity conference
   * Jim Basney suggested on the KCA replacement using ECP that cigetcert contact !MyProxy instead of jobsub_init.   On the !OAuth-based proposal, he suggested using HTTPs-based kerberos & password authentication with !MyProxy instead of ssh.
