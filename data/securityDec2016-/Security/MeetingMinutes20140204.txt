   * VOMS AUP signing?
   * A machine at Xsede/TACC was compromised. Was caught same day. Users logged in at the time were identified. One OSG user, he didn't have any certificates on the system.
   * Tim C. asked if its ok to close https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-983. Closed, will open new ticket if issues come up.
   * New CA bundles in testing.
   * Updating the CA package to the new layout. Opened GOC tickets for DOSAR and DayaBay to see if/when they will update voms-admin. Horst is investigating for DOSAR, DayaBay will be shutting down their voms server.
   * When Perfsonar releases the patch, we will send an update to our sites. 
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Will evaluate security of perfSonar test box at GOC and the perfSonar dashboard. Downloaded live image, need to try it out.
   * Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0.
