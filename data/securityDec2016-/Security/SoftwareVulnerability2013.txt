*Date*: 6/17/13<br>
*Software*: Linux (kernel)<br>
*Severity*: Low<br>
*Summary*: Red Hat has issued an update for the kernel. This fixes multiple
vulnerabilities, which can be exploited by malicious, local users in
a guest virtual machine to cause a DoS (Denial of Service) and gain
escalated privileges and by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial
of Service).

1) An error within KVM when initializing a guest's registered pv_eoi
(paravirtualized end-of-interrupt) indication flag during entering
the guest can be exploited to cause a crash.

2) An error within the "kvm_set_memory_region()" function of KVM
allows a user-space process to register memory regions pointing to
the kernel address space, which can be exploited to gain additional
privileges.

3) A double-free error when handling skbs during congestion within
the Linux kernel's Virtual Ethernet Tunnel driver (veth) can be
exploited to cause a crash.

*Date*: 4/19/13<br>
*Software*: Java<br>
*Severity*: Medium<br>
*Summary*: Critical vulnerabilities have been found for client installations of java. Still checking if the couple server side related issues might affect OSG's packaging of Java.
Gratia uses RMI, which is one of the java components vulnerable in server installs. It appears that gratia does not expose the rmi interface to the internet, so it should be safe until a new osg java release is ready. A new osg java release is already in progress with the software team.<br>
A new java version has been released for both OSG 1.x and 3.x.<br>
