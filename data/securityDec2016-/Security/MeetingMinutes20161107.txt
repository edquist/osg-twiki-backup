   * Made cigetcert 1.15 & 1.16 since last security team meeting.  The fix was to prevent cigetcert from reusing an old proxy's DN when trying to store a new cilogon cert to MyProxy.  I did it badly in 1.15, however, and had to immediately fix in 1.16.  I should have a regression testing suite for cigetcert.
   * My patch to singularity, to set the home directory inside of the container, has been accepted.  Brian decided that the O.S. feature he thought was missing from EL6 was really there, so I tried it out.  That feature worked, but I ran into another possibly significant problem: cvmfs repos mounted after startup cannot be seen inside the container.
   * Expecting Steve Tuecke on Wednesday.  I sent a reminder to him this morning, haven't heard back yet.

   *  CILogon Service Update on Monday, November 7th 2016. There will be a minor code update for the CILogon Services. No downtime expected.
   * Vulnerability reported in Xrootd. Examining possible exploits.
