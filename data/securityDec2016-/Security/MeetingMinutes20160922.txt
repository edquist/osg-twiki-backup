   * cigetcert 1.7 released including all the responses to the code review plus support for Debian.  cigetcert 1.8 adds support for VOMS proxies.  Installed as test version on el5 & el6 Fermilab ups area.  Very soon I will be adding support for $X509_USER_PROXY
   * An [[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/issues/13872][agreement]] was reached for both jobsub_submit and ifdh to share grid proxies in the standard location ${X509_USER_PROXY:-/tmp/x509up_`id -u`}
   * New jobsub version is adding cigetcert -n option and telling the user how to run cigetcert if it fails; jobsub used to do that but recent versions had dropped it.
   * Began discussion with FIFE support group about the documentation to help them help users with jobsub submission authorization errors.
   * Rescheduling Steve Tuecke for November after he had to cancel for this week
   * Need to upload draft of CHEP poster on cigetcert/DCAFI by a week from Monday, October 3; the deadline was pushed back a week.  The first draft was done, but Jeny is now improving it based on feedback.

   * A vulnerability was found in the canl-c library which is used by gridsite where it is possible for a user with any certificate, including a self-created one, to impersonate any other user. Reported by EGI SVG, rated as “Critical”.
      * Services using the mentioned library and where authorization depends only on Distinguished Names (DN) are affected. FTS, LFC and DPM are mentioned in the draft.
         * https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31295
         * [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-2016-11476][https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-2016-11476]]
      * OSG worker node client includes FTS and canl-c library (2.1.6. version since the last year). Vulnerability was fixed in canl-c 2.1.7. New version was picked from EPEL updates and included in September release.
   Forthcoming OpenSSL releases fixing several security defects: [[https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-September/000076.html][https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-September/000076.html]]
   * Vulnerability reported in MySQL application [[http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.html][CVE-2016-6662]]. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges and gain control of the server hosting the affected version of MySQL. Tim C. is checking the MySQL version distributed in OSG Software Stack.
         * A related and undisclosed vulnerability CVE-2016-6663 will be published shortly. "The undisclosed vulnerability makes it easy for certain attackers to create /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf file with arbitrary contents without the FILE privilege requirement."
   * Security training for new VO: SPT was conducted September 16th. Waiting for project8 and miniclean VOs.
