---+ Meeting Minutes 04/17/2012

Mine and Anand are on vacation. In attendance, Kevin and Marko.

---+++ Security Drill questions
   * We got an email response about the upcoming security drill asking how long they should schedule for the drill, as the normal admin is only scheduled for 2 hours a day for OSG work. We think it should probably be reasonable to assume this will take less than a day depending on how familiar the admin is with their systems.
   * Also, he was not able to access the web page in the email. Looks like he is not in the Grid group on the wiki, We will add him manually if he has a twiki account.

---+++ Vulnerabilities.
   * Hadoop vulnerability appears to not affect OSG's releases according to Doug who packages it.
   * Red Hat released Tomcat packages last week, but it appears this is related to a January Tomcat release, not a new official Tomcat release.
