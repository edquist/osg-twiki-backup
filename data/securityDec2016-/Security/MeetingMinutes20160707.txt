   * Mine should email and check if the GOC vulnerability issue is fixed. This is completed. Scott confirms that the vulnerability is fixed. 
   * cigetcert by default does not try kerberos unless the '-k' option is given.  I think I should change that to try it whenever a specific kerberos IdP is identified.  It is theoretically possible that one IdP URL can do both, but we couldn't figure it out for Fermilab so we use two different URLs on the same IdP, one marked with "(Kerberos)" in [[https://cilogon.org/include/ecpidps.txt][CILogon's ECP IdP list]].   I didn't want to try kerberos by default for everybody because some institutions won't use it and it will be extra overhead.
   * Redhat has one response to my ticket requesting user-level mount namespaces in RHEL7 to say they would enable it as soon as the patches fixing related CVEs are backported, but they haven't answered what it would take for that to happen.   
   * At one point Brian thought that he could do separate namespaces inside glexec by chroot() to a CVMFS directory containing a copy of the SL6 operating system, but a more recent message sounds like he still doesn't have an idea for a complete solution.  I'm not sure why yet, it's confusing.

   * On vacation

---++ Anand
   * dcache vulnerability:  
   * CA Package Release: Ask Romain what is so urgent about the current IGTF release and whether the SAM tests will fail due to 2 expiring CAs. 
   * Restrict the security permissions to our team only on the security team working area. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30430
   * Security Drill: Both Jeny and I had problems submitting jobs to OSG. Asked the OSG software team for instructions. Terrance sent me some pointers to submit jobs to the HTCondor CE. Will likely test it next week.
