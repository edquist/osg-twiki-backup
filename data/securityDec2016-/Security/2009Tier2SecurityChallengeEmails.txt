---++ Security Challenge Run Instructions for the Security Team
   1. The challenge against BNL is on 5/11. the challenge against FNAL is on 5/18. 
   1. On the challenge day, send a reminder email to GOC as shown below. A prior email must have already been sent. 
   1. Test Operator (TOP) will submit the test process to the site. TOP will *WAIT* until the test process starts up and sends data to http://rooier.nikhef.nl/ssc3/SSC_300yui/treeviewmenu.html (the monitoring web site)
   1. *After* the test process shows up in the monitoring web site, send an email to the site security contacts as shown below.
   1. On each email subject line, write [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL] 
   1. Keep copy of all communications and their TIMESTAMPS. 
   1. Site security contacts are expected to email osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org address directly for all email communication. *However* we advertise security@opensciencegrid.org address heavily as part of our incident response. Thus there could be a site which sends an email to the security@ address. GOC is aware of the situation and they will forward any such email to us asap. 
   1. Normally, security team discusses incidents on security-discuss-l or incident-discuss-l mailing lists. However, we will not use these email lists during the test drill. All email communication will happen between osg-security-team@ and site security contacts' email addresses. 
   1. Once the site kills the process and sends an email, check with the web monitoring and record the time
   1. When the site claims they banned the offending uid, try re-sending the test process to verify. If the test process runs, ask the site to re-try banning. Record the time when the offending uid can no longer access the site. 
   1. If the site cannot respond within 72 hour, the test process will kill itself. 
   1. If the site fails to clean up the test process, close ports etc, work with the site to restore the computer state prior to the drill. Clean up all files created by the test process, close the ports. Make sure there is no security holes leftover. 
   1. Once the incident is over, ask the sites to restore access to the banned user. This action is not part of the grading criteria, but necessary for restoring access t security team members. 
   1. Once the drill is completed, create a report for each site and grade the sites based on the below criteria. 
   1. Send the sites draft report
   1. Prepare the final report to OSG EB

---++ EMAIL  to be sent to recruit sites 

This email is sent to the sites 2/3 weeks before the drill

Subject: OSG Security Drill  - SITE_NAME                                             
<verbatim> 
Hello,

The OSG Security Team will be conducting a Security Drill of CMS and
Atlas Tier 2's and other large sites.

We would like to schedule the drill on your site based on our mutual
availability. We have tentatively scheduled the weeks of Sept 21 and
Sept 28 for the Tier2 drills. Please fill out the following doodle to
reflect your availability.

  http://doodle.com/yvimk63cd28kux2u

The planned security drill consists of following steps:

  * The security team will submit a test job under a Test Operator
    credentials to each site.
  * The security team will then send email to site security contacts
    requesting prompt investigation of the activities of the Test
    Operator at their site.
  * Sites will be requested to follow normal security incident response
    procedures (with come caveats). In particular, each site should
    immediate report the security incident to the OSG Security Team
    according to the procedure outlined at:
- https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting

A more detailed instructions of what is expected of the site will be
forthcoming.

Overall, the security drill will test our capabilities in the following
three areas.

  * timely communication with the OSG Security Team
  * containment (find job processes and kill them, suspend the
    user from submitting additional jobs)
  * forensics (discovery of initiating site, analysis of network
    traffic, analysis of submitted binaries)

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.


Sincerely,
OSG Security Team

---++ Informatory Email to Sites 

This email is sent to the sites few days before the drill

Subject: OSG Security Drill Instructions and Date  - SITE_NAME                                             

<verbatim>

Hello,

*****************
When		*	
*****************
We plan to run the security drill on your site (ChangeMeSITE_NAME) on ChangeMeDATE

*************************
Drill Preparations 	*
*************************
Before the scheduled date the security team will also run a short test on your site to ensure that the drill can take place smoothly. You do NOT need to do anything for this test.

If you believe there will some specific challenges to effectively run the drill on your site (e.g. the queue wait time can be too long, your site allows submission only from particular IPs) please let us know in advance so we can work together and resolve these issues. 

*************************
On the Drill Day	*
*************************

On the scheduled drill date, the Security Team will submit a test job under a Test Operator's credentials to your site. We will give you the identity of the test operator (the Distinguished Name in his/her certificate). The test operator and the test job will be assumed as malicious. the security team will then send email to site security contacts requesting prompt investigation of the activities of the Test Operator at their site.

Sites are requested to follow normal security incident response procedures.

In particular,

1) The security team will send an alert email to site security contacts. The email subject line will contain [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL]. This marks the beginning of the drill.
2) Site contacts should send an immediate reply to security@opensciencegrid.org confirming they received the email alert. Sites will be graded based on how quickly they replied.
3) Sites must include [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL] in ALL of their email subject lines.
4) Sites immediately start their investigation on the incident. At every step, sites should send email updates to the security team email address directly (osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org)

At a minimum, sites are expected to:
5) Find the test process and kill them. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this step.
6) Ban the test user from submitting additional jobs. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.
7) Discover the incoming IP address of the test process. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.
8) Do an analysis of the network traffic (broader the better: there will be bonus points). Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.
9) Do an analysis of submitted binaries (there will be bonus point) . Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.

*****************
After the Drill	*
*****************
1) You should restore access to the banned test operator.
2) The test job will not cause any harm, but If you have encounter any trouble restoring your system, contact us.
3) If you have trouble killing the test job,it is configured to restore to remove all traces of itself after 72 hours.

*************************
What We Most Care About	*
*************************
1) How fast they respond to the incident alerts
2) How quickly and how well they are able to accomplish steps 2-9.


Please note that No sanctions must be applied against the Virtual Organization (VO) that was used to submit the job.

Please contact acknowledge the receipt of this email and let me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

OSG Security Team
