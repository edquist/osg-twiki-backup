---+Traceability Project Plan

---++Project Definition: 

This project aims to define the job traceability requirements from the viewpoints of OSG sites and VOs. It focuses only on user jobs submitted without X.509 credentials, and presents the security requirements for tracing these jobs back to the users. The project examines whether the existing OSG software tools have the technical capability to meet these requirements and makes recommendations to the software team to make these tools compatible with the requirements. 

---++Project Goals: 

The goal of the project is to enable the secure execution of end user jobs without X.509 credentials. To achieve this overarching goal, the project aims to:

   * Define the security requirements to trace grid jobs to users when such jobs submitted without end-user X.509 certificates.
   * Examine whether existing VO submission mechanisms can meet the requirements.
   * Recommend technical solutions and enhancements to existing software tools if they fall short of the requirements. 
   * Provide the VOs with the software tools that can meet the security requirements. 
   * Guide the VOs that are interested in having certificate-less jobs in meeting the security requirements; evaluate and assess the security of VO submission mechanisms and announce the results to OSG sites to foster acceptance of VO jobs. 

---++Major Project Steps and Milestones

   1 The job traceability requirements are described at OSG Traceability Requirements for End User Jobs without Certificates  at osg-docdb OSG-doc-1149-v1 . 
      * Milestone: This step is completed. 
   1 Gather feedback from the glideinwms and condor software teams about the requirements document whether the technical capabilities exist withing the software to meet the requirements.
      * Milestone: 4/30/2013 
   1 Gather feedback from the VO frontend and management teams about the requirements document. 
      * Milestone: Identify a VO interested in certificate-less user jobs and gather feedback by 4/30/2013
   1 Install and run a test frontend and examine how much traceability data already exists in the software stack.
      * Milestone: 3/30/2013
   1 Analyze the feedback received from the software teams and the VO staff, and identify the gaps in meeting the requirements.  
      * Milestone: 5/30/2013
   1 Recommend technical and procedural solutions to remedy the identified gaps. 
      * Milestone: 5/30/2013
   1 Communicate proposed solutions to software teams and the VO staff. 
      * Milestone: 6/15/2013. 

---+++ Step 2. Gather feedback from VO frontend and management staff 
 
We selected OSG-XSEDE VO as the first VO to gather feedback from. The selection process is determined by a VO's interest and willingness to try user certificate-less user jobs. The traceability requirements were sent to the VO management and technical staff in early March. %RED%Document the concerns here%ENDCOLOR%.
