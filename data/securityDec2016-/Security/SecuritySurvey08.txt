---++++ Results of the OSGSecuritySurvey08

The 2008 security controls interviews were done online, using the SurveyGizmo commercial website. It provided an automated way to generate multiple choice, text and other question types with minimum editing skills. There is also a useful distribution facility to invite participants, generate thank you notes, and collect the results. Metrics and graphics can also be generated on the SurveyGizmo site. 

The following security control families were included:

   * Data Controls
   * Configuration Management Controls
   * Access and Site Management
   * Scanning
