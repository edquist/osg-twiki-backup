---++++ The OSG Security Survey 08

This year, we are using the  [[http://www.surveygizmo.com/ SurveyGizmo]] commercial survey website to compose, distribute and compile the results of the internal OSG security controls update for all Services and Assets. [[http://www.surveygizmo.com/ SurveyGizmo]] Pro has a flexible survey form composer with easy to use online edit tools. It also has a facility for sending out and tracking survey invitations with optional thank-you notes, plus report generating features for compiling and generating simple graphs and charts to help interpret results.

As the raw audit forms come in, they will be stored in this twiki as artifacts, available to OSG Security and for possible audits. There will also be a tracking spreadsheet showing status of incoming responses, along with some reports from [[http://www.surveygizmo.com/ SurveyGizmo]] once all the responses are in. 


The following security control families are included in the survey:

   * Data Controls
   * Configuration Management Controls
   * Access and Site Management
   * Scanning

   See the attachments for the status of which OSG Core Services have been reported so far.
