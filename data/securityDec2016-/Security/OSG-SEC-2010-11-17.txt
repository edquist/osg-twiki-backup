Introduction
============

A vulnerability was reported in OpenSSL.  A remote user can send
specially crafted data to exploit a TLS extension parsing race
condition and trigger a buffer overflow, causing the target service
to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.


Recommendations
===============

Make sure vendor updates are applied as soon as they become available.

Updating OpenSSL outside of the vendor patches could potentially cause
issues if all other software components that use the OpenSSL libraries
are not rebuilt as well (this is not recommended).


Affected Systems
================

RedHat variants below RedHat 6 are not affected (such as SL4, SL5), but
other sites that run Debian, Suse, or other linux versions could be.  Sites
that run non-RedHat variants should check their version of OpenSSL and
follow the recommendations.


Details
=======

A remote user may be able to execute arbitrary code on the target system
or possibly cause denial of service conditions.

Multi-threaded TLS server applications that use OpenSSL's internal
caching mechanism are affected.

The Apache HTTP server and Stunnel are not affected.

The vulnerability is reported in versions 0.9.8f through 0.9.8o and
versions 1.0.0 and 1.0.0a.
