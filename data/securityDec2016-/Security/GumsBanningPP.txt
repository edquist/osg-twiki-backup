---++ Project Plan for Improvements in GUMS user Banning Interface  (DRAFT)
---+++ Problem Statement

When the OSG security team conducted a security drill, some sites found it difficult to correctly ban a user using GUMS. They had complaints about the interface and about not knowing how to troubleshoot where the problem is when the banning does not work.

---+++ Goal

The objective of this task is to simplify the banning process, improve the interface and provide troubleshooting documentation to guide site admins. In particular we hope to address the following issues:

   * The banning process can be complicated. The admins for example have create a new group of 'banned users' and add this group to the banned list. Even though we have some documentation this can be confusing to admins. One of the suggestions is to just have such a banned user group set up by default, so admins do not have to go through the hassle.
   * The entries that need to be entered in the interface to ban user can be confusing. Inexperienced sites admins report problems with banning that get traced back to errors entering FQAN. Some of them leave the field blank, expecting all the FQANs associated with the DN to be
banned. This however did not happen, infact the DN did not get banned. Though there may be use cases that could benefit from a USER/FQAN banning, this should not be a default option. Ideally what we would like is for the GUMS web interface admins to have a big red button that says 'BAN user' and he just has to enter the DN information, there could be an advanced option that would allow FQAN bans (if an admin really need this feature). 
   * There should be a mechanism that the admins could check if the banning has been successfully applied from the interface itself. 
   * Improve the documentation we have https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/BanningUsersAtSite, in particular add a troubleshooting section.

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand, Mine
   * Participants: GUMS developers, OSG Software,/GOC.

---+++ Deliverable from the project:
   * Update the GUMS default/template configuration provided to OSG sites to include a 'banned' group
   * Improve GUMS-admin interface to ban user. 
      * Include a red 'BAN user' button on a prominent location on GUMS admin interface
      * All FQANs on DN should be banned unless specified otherwise.
      * Interface to check if banning is successful
   * Create a troubleshooting guide

---+++ Schedule
   * Effort: TBD
   * Project start : TBD
   * Project End Date: TBD

---+++ Dependencies/ Risks
   * Need development effort from GUMS developers to improve interface.
   * OSG software team/GOC support needed to develop and release a new default template for GUMS configuration that includes a banned group.
