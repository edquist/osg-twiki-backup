---+ OSG Incident Response Contacts

This page lists private contact information for the OSG incident response process collected by the OSG security team.

Contact information for OSG personnel is available in the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Information Management System]]. See also [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Support_Centers][OSG Support Center]] contacts.

Note that the osg-peergrid-csirt-l@opensciencegrid.org list is currently not being used.

Romain requests that we use the project-egee-osct@cern.ch list for communication with EGEE. Note that in EGEE, the [[http://egee2.eu-egee.org/security/osct/][Operational Security Coordination Team]] (OSCT) is responsible for incident handling, while the [[http://egee2.eu-egee.org/security/gsvg/][Grid Security Vulnerability Group]] (GSVG) is responsible for handling software vulnerabilities.
