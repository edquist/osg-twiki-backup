*Kevin*:
   * Had to re-apply for mis vo membership. Got message that I needed to re-agree to the AUP only 4 hours before membership expired. On a Saturday no less.
   * Reviewing past OSG v3.1.x releases to see what is the oldest "safe" release from a security vulnerability perspective.
   * Newsletter articles, Traceability overview? Any interest outside Fermilab?

*Anand*:
   * Traceability report has two separate doc numbers, new one should be made new version of first one.
   * Look into having rpm for CILogon basic not clogger signing-policy file on updates.
   * Work on way to total top 10 sites to target for CILogon Basic cert usage. Not sure if there's already a chart summing up the usage from resources at unique sites.
