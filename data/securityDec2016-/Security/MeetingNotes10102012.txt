   * ST&E Review. No progress. Was not clear on what is expected from him. Pick top three risks from the Risk update document we have; propose mitigation scenarios and follow up work for each. 
   * Beast attack. No progress. Do research on srm authentication:in particular, is the client proxy used for channel authentication; is the user proxy later sent as a delegated proxy, if so is it a limited proxy? Contact bestman developers.  
   * WSGram assessment https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/WsGram. Questions: what capabilities wsgram provides today out of 1-2-3? and what should we be providing in future out of this options. 
   * GUMS has no SHA-2 problem. GUMS latest version with SHA-2 service cert, end user cert and a VOMS SHA-2 certs works fine. They only tested latest GUMS in ITB.
