---++Meeting Notes 

*Anand*
   * IGTF CA. Released today. Anand sent an email to Dan, Tim, Marco clarifying what security team has done and is planing to do. Anand completed the documentation request stated in JIRA Software- 776. 
   * SHA2 signed DOEgrid ca cert. Patti told s to ask back on october 19th. 
   * ST&E Review. No progress. Was not clear on what is expected from him. Pick top three risks from the Risk update document we have; propose mitigation scenarios and follow up work for each. 
   * Beast attack. No progress. Do research on srm authentication:in particular, is the client proxy used for channel authentication; is the user proxy later sent as a delegated proxy, if so is it a limited proxy? Contact bestman developers.  
   * WSGram assessment https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/WsGram. Questions: what capabilities wsgram provides today out of 1-2-3? and what should we be providing in future out of this options. 
   * GUMS has no SHA-2 problem. GUMS latest version with SHA-2 service cert, end user cert and a VOMS SHA-2 certs works fine. They only tested latest GUMS in ITB. 

*Kevin*
   * The new java vulnerability. We are not doing any more work on this until itis officially announced. 
   * Have not heard from EGI team about the drill yet. We decided not to penalize any sites who claimed never to receive a job from the drill. We will grade these sites accordingly. We will inform EGI team about the grades and notify the OSG sites with their grades. 
   * Pakiti: Email VDT team specifically with a reminder to start this work. Mine asked Tim if he received this ticket and Tim was not aware of it. Next steps are:
      * to complete the documentation. 
      * To publicize the Pakiti project with OSG sites. First send a general announcement. Second, select ten sites as pilots and reach out to them individually. Select 3 big sites, 3 medium size and 4 small sites. Tell them about Pakiti porject and whether they like to start using it. 
   * Condor vulnerability. Cannot run under MIS VO privileges. Gets an error message.  Will ask Steve Timm's help.
      * there was another Condor update. It included some security updates. One of them classified as high severity. Will investigate with Condor team. If it is important, we will ask sites to directly upgrade to this version rather than the version came out with patch for the earlier Condor vulnerability. 
   * Mine will work with Rob to figure out why GOC sent out the gratia vulnerability announcement without cc'ing security team. 
   * Complete the vulnerability report on voms-admin. 
   * Jury duty next week.  
   * will study Beast attack and WS-Gram security concerns.
