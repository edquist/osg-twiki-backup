---+ Certificate Management Documentation and Usability Feedback

We are writing some documentation
([[http://home.fnal.gov/~mslyz/draft_docs/SBGrid_signup.pdf][rough draft]])
to help improve their user sign up process.
Currently it's specialized for one VO but
we plan to make it more general for OSG use.

Also, here is some feedback from various VOs on the
[[https://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/certreg.php][new certificate registration portal]]:

1. The page ideally should not ask for a user
   certificate. This is confusing because
   the page is supposed to supply a certificate.
   
   It has been reported that this does not happen
   when there is no certificate loaded in the browser,
   as would probably be the case with a new user,
   or with the http (as opposed to the https) version
   of the page.
    
2. The link for the word "here" in "Instruction on how
   to find the DN from your existing certificate can be
   found here." goes to tinyurl.com. It would be a
   little better to have the real URL in its place
   since that would allow users to see what they are
   clicking.

3. At the bottom of the page, users are asked to select
   a key length, something which most of them probably
   know little about. It may be useful to have a longer
   discussion about the tradeoffs between the
   different lengths.
     Another suggestion was to only allow 2048 bit
   keys, and to eliminate this choice on the
   page. Possibly browsers have been supporting 2048
   bit keys for a long enough time.

4. It could be useful to have the certificate
   registration page communicate with the appropriate
   VOMRS server(s) so that the user (after agreeing to
   an AUP) could be placed in the correct VOMS without
   a separate registration process.
