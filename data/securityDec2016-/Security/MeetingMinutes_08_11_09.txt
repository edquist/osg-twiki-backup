---+++Site Admins meeting feedback and question
There were 5 tier3 admins, all of which we met and talked with. 2 of
them were impressively knowledgeable on security. (E.g. one of them
asked very detailed questions on a MD5 hash collision attack; the other
one had a very intelligent risk assessment discussion.) The other 3 were
quite unfamiliar.

---++++General issues:

   1. Communication. Almost all of them do not know which email lists to be
on. The large number of lists look overwhelming. So they did not sign up
for anything.

Answer given: I encouraged them to be registered with OIM. So that they can receive
announcements. For security, I will send them a list of email lists they
should watch for. For other areas, ???

   2. Communication. Who is OSG staff members? How to know if a new person
joins security team. How would we know we are contacted by the "real"
security team.

Answer given: All security team members have their PGP and DOE certs,
their pictures, and email addresses are on twiki.

What about rest of OSG team? how do I know who is the "real" software
coordinator? No answer for this.

   3. VO specific installation issues. e.g. couple CMS tier3 admins asked
me very specific questions on CRAB and which services at minimum should
be turned on, etc. It would be good to have a VO-knowledgeable person
there. In this case, a quick AIM with Burt solved the problems.


---++++Technical issues about security:

   1. Which certificate be used to run RSV probes. The difference between personal vs. service certificates

   2. Myproxy is very useful for us. Why do not OSG runs the service for the community?

Answer given: ESNet runs a MyProxy server. Can OSG advertise this more broadly???

   3. If a VO has multiple users mapped into a shared unix account, and if there was a credential theft, will I be held responsible?

Answer given: No. You followed the default VO configuration.

What if there was a legal problem? am I still be responsible , e.g. what about my universities security policies? what about legal restrictions.

Answer given: Learn your local policy and honor your local policy first. We do not know about the law. but we can show you how to enforce your universities policy.

   4. You do not provide signed/secure software packages. How will I know I got the right copy.

Answer given: We are working on this.

   5. what are your efforts to move away from MD5. it has a lifetime of 1year left.

Answer given: Working on it. Testing the software. then working with CAs.

   6. If there is a software patch, we would want to wait until a production tier 1 deploys and tests the patch. We do not want to deploy immediately. Can't you pick designated test volunteers?

Answer given: I do not know. but can ask testing folks. usually it is not a good idea to wait too long if it is a urgent patch. but we understand why you want to wait.


   7. I run a 10Gig network and a Tier3 cluster. I need network level security tools. can you help me?
Answer given: We can direct you to right people and tools.


   8. rpm CA package is NOT signed. but you sign the pacman CA package. Why?
Answer given: This is an oversight. we will sign both.
*Update: DONE*

   9. Some tools (dbs) do not use GUMS. what else? does everything else in OSG use GUMS

   10. where can we get a list of banned users up until now? is there a central repository? is there anyone I should ban now?

Answer given: No. All banned users certs are revoked. There is no need to ban anyone. But we can publish a running list of banned users in the past.
