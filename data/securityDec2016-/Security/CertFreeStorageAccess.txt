--++Accessing Data Storage and Transfer Elements without End User Certificates

Currently, an end user needs an X.509 certificate to access storage and data transfer elements, such as gridftp, dcache, xrootd, etc.  We research alternative access control models, where the user does not have to directly use or own a certificate to access storage and transfer elements because we believe that concealing the certificate use or completely eliminating it significantly improves the user's grid experience. For brevity, from now on we call data storage and transfer elements data delivery services.  


---+++Accessing the Storage and Data Delivery without any certificates

Our goal is to research whether we can find a method of accessing  the data delivery services without any end user certificates. We are inspired by our success in finding a way to submit jobs without end user certificates. In our work with job submission systems, we focused on glideinWMS workflow system and observed that the glideinWMS system keeps detailed information about the user and his/her job throughout the job life cycle. As a result, as any given moment, we could trace a job back to the owner. this observation allowed us to forgo the certificates because we could trace the jobs back to users even without a certificate. In order to make sure that only authorized users submit jobs, we asked VO job submission nodes to implement sound access control methods based on username passwords or RSA keys. Once only authorized users access the job submission system, it was pretty easy to track their activities via the GlideinWMS system. 

Our goal was to build a system for accessing data delivery services similar to the one we designed for our job submission system. However, our findings turned out to be different. First of all, glideinWMS system provides a uniform way of accessing several different resource managers on sites, Condor, PBS, Globus, etc. the GlideinWMS handles sending jobs to all these different systems
