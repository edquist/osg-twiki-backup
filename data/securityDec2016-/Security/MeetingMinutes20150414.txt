   * OSG CATests. 
      * New ca cert functional testing finished except for certificate renewal. Needs short lived certificate. Highest Priority
      * Continue with the existing tests. 
   * Mat Selmeci updated cilogon rpms in osg development repo. Will move up to testing after next release.
      * we should remove the OpenID CA from this bundle. Highest priority.
   * Investigated lshell vulnerabilities. Does not appear to be any recent reports. Were a couple in 2012. Does not seem to be any recent releases. Continueto research other options. Review Tony's proposal. 3rd priority
   * Oasis master key replication. Scott wants someone else to have a copy of the master key. Rob will have a copy. Kevin reviewed the plan and ok with it. One important vulnerability is when Scott uses the master key to sign the intermediate keys, it gets copied into the file system. He needs to manually delete it afterwards. Kevin will check if Scott does this and if Scott has a well-documented process. 
   * Fermilab KCA to Cilogon Basic CA transition. Kevin will complete the draft. 2nd priority
   * Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill. 4th priority
