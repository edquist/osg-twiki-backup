   * Writeup of HTCondor-CE security drill.
   * Will wrap up risk assessment doc next.
   * Thinking about what to do for All Hands Meeting. I would like to get security surveys out before the meeting and set up meetings with everyone instead of waiting months and months for people to respond.
   * Giving security talk at dept. meeting tomorrow. Focus on federated logins I think...
   * examine the gratia probe that is being retired. what information will we miss by losing this probe?
