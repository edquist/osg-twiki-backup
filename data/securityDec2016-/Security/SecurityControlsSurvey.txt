10-G) How do you terminate rights of authorized recipients? Which mechanisms are used to achieve this?  

11) If you do not own any limited data, skip to Question 12. If you have multiple data under restricted category and each one has different answers for the following questions, please answer the questions for each data separately	 

11-A) Who is authorized to access the data? How do you determine this list of people?  

11-B) How do you communicate the security requirements to the data to authorized recipients ? Do the recipients agree to the requirements? Do you keep record of such communications in a way that can be audited?	  

11-C) Which access control mechanisms applies to this data?  

11-D) Do you keep logs of access to the data? And if so, how long do you keep the log files?   

11-F) What information is recorded in the log files?

12) If you have any public data, please answer the following questions  

12-A) What are the, if there are any, access control mechanisms applied to your Public data to maintain its integrity? (An example would be a list of the authorized people who can modify the data.) 											 

---++ Configuration Management  

1) Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  

2) Please indicate if you have read the OSG Security Plan, Configuration Management section 2.4.4 within the past 12 months and understand your responsibilities for Monitoring, Version Control and Security Review of the OSG Core resources under your control.

2) What system do you use to report and track vulnerabilities of your core service. E.g. Do you maintain vulnerability logs?   

3) What steps do you employ to mitigate vulnerability to your core services. For e.g. What types of vulnerability scanning are being done? Do you have regular scheduled updates/maintenance schedule to fix known vulnerabilities?  
 
---++ Physical/Console Access Control 

1) Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  

2) Please indicate if you have read the OSG Security Plan, Physical Access Control and Site Management section 2.4.6 within the past 12 months and understand your responsibilities for the OSG Core resources under your control. This document can be found at the OSG DocDB website:  HYPERLINK "https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389" https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389 *  3) Physical access to all production core OSG systems must be controlled -- with a lock, key, etc.  Verify that  your core OSG resources comply with this requirement and are indeed in an access controlled area, as defined above.  4) Who among your team currently has root and sudo access on the OSG systems providing core services and what is the policy of granting such access?  5) According to the OSG Security Plan, network login or command line access to a production core OSG system shall be permitted only from a client via secure authorization and authentication mechanisms. Describe which authorization and authentication mechanisms you are using for secure network login or command line access by privileged staff versus unprivileged users.  6) All production core OSG systems shall run the absolute minimum set of network services required for their functions.   Have you verified in the past year that your core OSG resource systems are running only those network services necessary for system operation? Also list the network services running that are deemed NOT necessary.  7) All production core OSG service providers must have a plan describing redundancy or other mechanisms used to maintain service availability in case of operational disruption or emergencies. Please describe the redundancy plans that would be deployed for your core service to ensure availability in case of unplanned disruption or emergency.  8) On each production core OSG system, a copy of the system and service logs shall be saved on line for at least 30 days.  Have you verified within the past year that this requirement is being met?  
 Authentication Control 

1) Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  2) Indicate that you have read the OSG Security Plan, Access Control section 2.5.2 Scanning section 2.5.3 within the past 12 months and understand your corresponding responsibilities for the OSG Core resources under your control. This document can be found at the OSG DocDB website:  HYPERLINK "https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389" https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389 *  3) What authentication mechanism is employed for privileged access to core resources  4)  How is privileged access to core resource granted and what authorization technique is used?  5) What is the authentication and authorization techniques used for non-privileged user access?  6) At what frequency are you scanning web services for vulnerabilities and what types of vulnerability scanning are being done?  7) What remedial procedures are followed when vulnerabilities are detected?  8) What steps are being taken to scan for local vulnerabilities/intrusion detection and how often?
