   * Rowhammer vulnerability interesting, but not directly a grid problem.
   * Repeated sha2 intermediate cert tests with host certs. Seems to work fine. Do we need more tests?
   * Started writing demo for AHM. Plan for worker nodes without host certs, gsi-ssh, and docker demo.
   * Filed request to get ECP turned on on Fermilab's IDP to enable command line access to cilogon certs here.
