---+ OSG - LIGO working group on ID management and !AuthZ
A working group was set up in June 2006 to define workplan and goals for the OSG RA, Privilege Project, OSG Ops and LIGO so that OSG and LIGO efforts are optimized and meet the functional needs of LIGO.

Working group members:
   * LIGO - Warren Anderson, Murali Ramsunder, Albert Lazzarini, Kent Blackburn
   * OSG - Doug Olson, Gabriele Garzoglio, Leigh Grundhoefer



---++ Seattle meeting, Aug. 20
The working group will meet in Seattle at UW on Sunday, Aug. 20, the day before
the OSG Consortium meeting.

We will start at 9am PDT, Aug. 20.

Room location - Physics and Astronomy Building, room B305, near east end of B wing, 3rd floor.
Campus map - http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/southwest.html?PAB.

Attending in person are: Warren, Murali, Kent, Doug, Leigh.  Gabriele will
attend by phone/internet 9am-noon.  We may get one other person from the Privilege Project.

Remote details: ESnet ad-hoc H.323 service, ID 88674572 (88 OSG LSC), teleconf. 510-883-7860.

Suggested agenda:
   * LIGO status & needs for ID management & authorization (Warren)
   * OSG RA/CA features (Doug)
   * Privilege Project features (Gabriele)
   * (other?)
   * discussion
   * review action items & identified workplan areas

---++ Notes and Action Items

Action Items:
   1. Persistent certificates
      * onasys services are part of real-time data processing and should run for 2 or 3 years without down time and certificate expiration can cause failures of the service
      * Options for fix: long lived certificates, or improved replacement of expiring certificates
         * if long lived certificates is possible this is the simplest solution
         * procedure to monitor and replace expiring certificates may be more robust
         * certificate that do not touch anything outside of dedicated LIGO resources could be made manually without need for IGTF accredited CA
   2. Registration with LIGO for VO membership is coupled (for efficiency) with certificate issuance
      * It is necessary for LIGO members to get certificate from LIGO agents in order to have the verification for LIGO VO membership
      * For consideration - it would he helpful to have a component like O=LIGO in the DN of the issued certificates.
   3. Certificate renewal notices
      * Would be useful for agents to get notification when a certificate holder gets a self-authenticated replacement certificate, so that agent can check if re-authentication is necessary
   4. Consider making and publishing policy that certificate holders are required to notify RA when their affiliation changes
      * would help prevent self-authenticated certificate extension for people who no longer qualify to have a certificate or that have anyone associated with the RA who could authenticate them.
   5. Add additional output field to cert-lookup script to display o field (holds RA/VA affiliation)
   6. When GUMS pulls info from VOMS is the order of users (DNs) repeatable? (helps with account mapping)
   7. Is it possible to use a set of arbitrary and pre-generated strings for the account names for pool accounts


---++ List of Issues

From Warren, May 31:
<verbatim>
The root of the issue, however, is that the LIGO Data 
Grid's (LDG's) user model is different than OSG's (as I understand it). In 
particular, LDG users have local accounts on LDG clusters, and my 
understanding is that we are not looking to change that soon. This led us to 
a set of specific requirements for our Certificate issuance process that we 
thought would be best handled "in house", particularly in light of the fact 
that those requirements have been evolving and will certainly continue to 
evolve for the foreseeable future. The requirements identified by the LIGO 
Computing Committee were:

1) Certificates with multi-year lifetimes. We are gearing up to have analysis 
jobs that analyze multi-year data sets in real time on the LIGO data grid, 
for which we want certificates which last for multiple years. These jobs have 
in the past been associated with user certificates, which provide clear 
accounting. There has recently been a move toward service certificates for 
this so that a set of users can share the load of "managing" runaway jobs and 
so that some jobs can be given higher priorities in the Condor queue without 
giving any single user a higher priority. I think this is still sorting 
itself out.

2) User certificates should be tightly coupled to user accounts. Much work on 
the LIGO data grid is done with user accounts. We wish to use certificates 
for both authentication and authorization of users on the LIGO data grid. 
Eventually, the LIGO Computing Committee wants the signing of a certificate 
to automatically invoke a process which creates an LDG user account account 
across the LIGO data grid associated with that certificate.

3) Quick turn around on certificate revocation. Associated with requirements 
1) and 2), we do not want long-lived certificates hanging around after their 
usefulness expires. We also want to be able to lock out users who leave the 
collaboration on short (< day) time scales. If accounts are tied closely to 
certificates, and activated automatically with certificate signing, it is 
natural to use certificate revocation to close access to accounts as well.

4) Clear identification of LIGO certificates as opposed to OSG or other 
certificates. In particular, associated with 2) we wish to have clear 
visibility into the provenance of a certificate which is associated with an 
account on the LDG. There have been cases in the past where LIGO members from 
institutions which have access to DOEGrids certificates through 
non-LIGO-related mechanisms have used those non-LIGO-related mechanisms to 
obtain certificates with which they have applied for accounts. This has 
created confusion in the past. My understanding is that this problem has been 
mitigated to a large extent by separating LIGO from iVDGL in the current 
DOEGrids implementation.

In the collective minds of the LIGO Computing Committee, which Albert chairs, 
I believe these are the primary issues that argued in favor of implementing a 
simple LIGOGrids CA which would be associated only with LIGO data grid 
accounts. I, for one, would welcome any input on how best to satisfy these 
requirements, either using DOEGrids certificates or implementing our own CA.

From Patrick, July 17:
<verbatim>
I was reminded 
today of a simple change that we would like to see to facilitate use of the 
OSG/DOE CA for LIGO.  I received the attached e-mail reminding me to renew my 
certificate.   It would be very useful to make the e-mail more precise about 
the where a given user should find instructions about renewing certificates.  
For example,  we currently have instructions at

http://www.lsc-group.phys.uwm.edu/lscdatagrid/doc/renewcert.html

which I followed and was good to go for another year.  Many LSC members with 
certs don't know to look for these instructions. Would it be possible to 
tailor the renewal e-mail to have a pointer to these instructions for 
certificates issued to LIGO collaborators?  (BTW,  the particular url will 
probably change near the end of august,  but it's the principal that I'm 
interested in.)
