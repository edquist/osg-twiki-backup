---++ Meeting Minutes 11/17/2009

*Ron*
   * *Action Item*: which security controls are expiring? which ones we should start with? 

*Anand* : 
   * CA Debian package creation. Needed Doug's help, but problem solved. 
      * We may need some new code rewritten. Assumptions from vdt needs to be changed. 1 week worth of work. apt repository needs to be handled by GOC. 
   * RSV status reports and linking definitions. Nothing to do until next RSV release
      * *Action Item* when is the next RSV release 
*Doug*
   * Replicating the doegrids database. rWe want to monitor certificates requests and revocations. 
      * *Action Item*: 2 things needed to complete the project: separate database from update script; move over to a production area. convert vm image to xen and kvm. where should we run this service at goc? what kind of vmware goc has ? database can run on arbitrary system. scripts are more flaky. how can we access the scripts? directly accessing the replicate database is needed for monitoring. a couple hundred of certificate requests are made weeklu  
      * Anand is not needed to help
   * *Action Item*: DOEGrids postmortem questions. 
   * fermi kca switch off. 
          
*Igor*
   * whether pacman signatures would work with pgp signature --have not checked. 
   * bestman security architecture. caching of gums mapping. bestman will ask once and then cache it. 
   * p12 to pem conversion. This is not needed. our software would work with p12 and pem.  
      * *Action Item* change the documentation. ask weichel to coordinate it.  

*Jim* 
   * ticket for blosgspot has not updated

      * go through the drill. 
      * close the open tickets.
