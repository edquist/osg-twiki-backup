---++ Security Meeting Notes

Rob Quick, Doug, Mine and Ron

1) the CMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo does not show up in GUMS service at Indiana. Rob will look ito this. Mine will not open a ticket

2) Mine really needs to see resource and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo contact names. Rob will provide access to entire security team as soon as possible. 

3) any missing core service owners in OIM. Only John McGee is not registered. We can keep Mats Rynge instead of his contact

4) should we take the RSV probe issue to joint operations meeting. Rob no longer goes to EGEE-OSG operations meeting. Mine shoudl find out which venue this needs to be discussed. Once we develop a WLCG tailored probes, we must also determine how to miantain the probes, who to own them and etc. 

5) Doug has already put some info related to proxy expiration in dcache. it is in the proxy expiration page started by Jim Basney

6) Ron will continue finishing up the core service access lists. Once they are done and the new resource type is ready in OIM, Ron will enter them into OIM

7) Doug is going to do a survey of storage technologies per OSG VOs. Mine is not clear about which VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo uses which technology and protocol, an what are the technology ramifications. Mine asked Doug to talk to Andy at Stanford about xrootd security issues. Doug thinks that Andy's code is no longer used for xrootd. 

8) Jim is on vacation.
