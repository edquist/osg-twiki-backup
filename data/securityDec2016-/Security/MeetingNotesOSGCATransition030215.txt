---++Meeting Notes
Participants: Chander, Alain, Rob, Jim, Kevin, Neha, Tim C, Soichi, Clemmie, Suchandra

Topics: 

   * We are planning to transition our users to new backend on a VO-by-VO basis. Tim questioned whether this approach covers all necessary use cases? In other words, will there be a need for transitioning users in a different fashion or based-on a different attribute? 

      * So far, we do not have other use cases. 
 
   * Publish the Plans related to this project online. 
      * DONE. This is under the main project wiki. 
 
   * The development work will be delayed for a week because Soichi has other commitments such as spring break, ahm, and the training session after ahm. Move the end date for the development to 4/10.  

   * Give plenty of advanced warning to ITB sites. These sites are mostly volunteers, an advanced notice about the upcoming ITB tests will be very useful 

   * When we transition a VO, should we switch their host and user certificates at the same time? 
      * Yes. There is no reason not to. Also, doing otherwise will prolong the transition process  

   * Tim volunteered to run automated tests on CIlogon tests. 

   * If we implement our idea of automated VOMS registration, how many VOs will benefit? CMS and Atlas will already be using CERN CA. And OSG VO does not use end user certs. 
      * Take this as an Action Item. 

   * In the transition plan, count all the services that will need dn registration other than VOMS. 
      * Take this as an Action Item

   * How different CIlogon service level criteria is from DigiCert? Does OSG need to change its SLA with its VOs? 
      * Take this as an Action Item. Update on 03/05/15: Had a meeting with CIlogon team about their service levels. We found no significant difference between CIlogon and DigiCert operating levels. We will draft a new SLA for our relationship with CIlogon and send it to management. We do not foresee any reason to change OSG's SLA with its VOs.
