---++ Coordinating tests of new CA distribution format on production sites
%TOC%
The proposed change in the CA package due to the new layout from IGTF to accommodate openssl 1.0 is slated to go into production on OSG with the next IGTF release. The changes have already been identified in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP7][SEP7]] and implemented. However since this change affects our security infrastructure significantly the security team will like to have the changes tested on few older versions of Production sites before we roll out a production deployment. For this purposes the chosen test sites will be asked to temporarily install the CA package from the ITB CA cache. Below you will find instructions for how to accomplish this change, how to rollback in case of errors or after the testing is complete and a short survey of the testing.

      * gsiftp
      * RSV probes
      * vdt-update-certs
      * vdt-ca-manage
      * fetch-crl
   2. SE (dcache/bestman)
   3. GUMS
   4. VOMS
   5. OSG client
      * globus client tools
      * srm client tools
      * Condor-G
   6. WN Client

   8. glexec

---+++ Software versions to be tested
---++++ OSG CE, WN Client, glexec
Using the information on the page we have identified potential candidates for testing each of the OSG version we have deployed on production (see list of sites below). 

When possible we have tried to use sites that are running multiple versions of OSG on different CEs and those that we believe have good experience on OSG. On these sites we hope we can test the CE services, glexec and OSG_WN Client. 

   * 1.0.1(EXP) gaia.physics.mcgill.ca
   * 1.0.4(EXP) abitibi.sbgrid.org
   * 1.0.5 cunygrid.gc.cuny.edu
   * 1.2.0(EXP) cms-xen19.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.1 smuosggate.physics.smu.edu
   * 1.2.3 ce01.cmsaf.mit.edu
   * 1.2.4 ff-grid.unl.edu
   * 1.2.5 ff-grid3.unl.edu
   * 1.2.6 iut2-grid6.iu.edu
   * 1.2.7 fester.utdallas.edu
   * 1.2.8 cmsosgce.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.9 tier2-01.ochep.ou.edu
   * 1.2.10 grid1.oscer.ou.edu
   * 1.2.11 ouhep0.nhn.ou.edu
   * 1.2.13 ff-grid2.unl.edu
   * 1.2.14 gpn-husker.unl.edu
   * 1.2.15 cmsosgce3.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.16 fermigridosg1.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.17 d0cabosg1.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.18 cms-xen2.fnal.gov

As for 1.2.x sites do we need to test all sub versions or would it be ok to test a subset that had a significant change in the CE software stack.

Looking at the release notes (available 1.2.4+) it may be sufficient only to test following (1.2.4+) subversion: 1.2.4, 1.2.6, 1.2.9, 1.2.10,
1.2.14, 1.2.16, 1.2.17, 1.2.18. 


---++++ SE
   * Test srm/dcache, srm/bestman, xrootd, hadoop?
   * Need to identify production versions that are being used in the OSG and few sites that are will to test
   * Coordinate with the developers (and storage team)
      * Ask them to test all the major versions of the software that are deployed on OSG
      * Inquire if testing of minor versions are also needed
      * Record and discuss any concerns they might have. Identify any versions that might have problems and develop a plan to patch them is deemed appropriate.
      * Get developers signoff

---++++ GUMS
   * Need to identify production versions that are being used in the OSG and few sites that are will to test
   * Coordinate with the developers at BNL
      * Ask them to test all the major versions of the software that are deployed on OSG
          * Test minor versions if needed
      * Identify any versions that might have problems and develop a plan to patch them is deemed appropriate.
      * Get developers signoff
   * Do we also need to test SAZ, LCAS, LCMAPS, edg-mkgridmap etc?

---++++ VOMS
   * Need to identify production versions that are being used in the OSG and few sites that are will to test
   * We need to test voms-admin, voms-rs
   * We need to better understand the problems EGI had after their switch.
      * John W tested it and was unable to reproduce the errors encountered by EGEE.
   * Coordinate with the developers 
      * Ask them to test all the major versions of the software that are deployed on OSG
          * Test minor versions if needed
      * Identify any versions that might have problems and develop a plan to patch them is deemed appropriate.
      * Get developers signoff


---++++ OSG Client
   * What OSG client versions need to be tested?
      * Is there any way to know what versions are being used.
  
---++++ Pilot job framework
   * Need to test the OSG Pilot factory. Need to coordinate with Igor?
   * Need testing of glexec versions deployed on production site.
      * We need to involve glexec developers to test older versions of the code
      * Has been tested on ITB
