   * Cert-Request script looks up list of VO. xml-parser is needed to parse the list of VOs. Parser library needs to be configured. Therefore, every CE who downloads the code will have to configure the parser. GOC only wants to provide xml file. GOC retired old csv file while during some transition. Static list comes with code itself. Ask GOC to include a step in their VO onboarding process that they send out a ticket to security team. The security team will manually add the VO.
