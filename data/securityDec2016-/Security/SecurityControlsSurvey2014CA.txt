Yes

---+++ 3. Physical access to all production core OSG systems must be controlled -- with a lock, key, etc.  Verify that  your core OSG resources comply with this requirement and are indeed in an access controlled area, as defined above.
IU datacenter requires proper access cards and biometric palm scan to enter the datacenter.

---+++ 4. Who among your team currently has root and sudo access on the OSG systems providing core services and what is the policy of granting such access?  
I believe all the OSG GOC staff have root and sudo access.  Tom Lee and Scott Teige are the only ones I'm aware that can grant root and sudo access.

---+++ 5. According to the OSG Security Plan, network login or command line access to a production core OSG system shall be permitted only from a client via secure authorization and authentication mechanisms. Describe which authorization and authentication mechanisms you are using for secure network login or command line access by privileged staff versus unprivileged users.  
I believe we use ssh keys to access machines via the console

---+++ 6. All production core OSG systems shall run the absolute minimum set of network services required for their functions.   Have you verified in the past year that your core OSG resource systems are running only those network services necessary for system operation? Also list the network services running that are deemed NOT necessary.  
Tom Lee our admin would have the specifics on this topic.

---+++ 7. All production core OSG service providers must have a plan describing redundancy or other mechanisms used to maintain service availability in case of operational disruption or emergencies. Please describe the redundancy plans that would be deployed for your core service to ensure availability in case of unplanned disruption or emergency.  
Tom Lee our admin would have the specifics on this topic.

---+++ 8. On each production core OSG system, a copy of the system and service logs shall be saved on line for at least 30 days.  Have you verified within the past year that this requirement is being met?  
Tom Lee our admin would have the specifics on this topic.

OSG PKI

---+++ 2. Indicate that you have read the OSG Security Plan, Access Control section 2.5.2 Scanning section 2.5.3 within the past 12 months and understand your corresponding responsibilities for the OSG Core resources under your control.

PKI

---+++ 5. What is the authentication and authorization techniques used for non-privileged user access?  
Access is not possible without a certificate.

---+++ 6. At what frequency are you scanning web services for vulnerabilities and what types of vulnerability scanning are being done?  
Tom Lee would know the frequency of scanning if it's done.

---+++ 7. What remedial procedures are followed when vulnerabilities are detected?  
I defer to Tom Lee for this.

---+++ 8. What steps are being taken to scan for local vulnerabilities/intrusion detection and how often?
