---++Survey of OSG VOs Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Statement

This OSG security team conducted a survey of OSG VOs to ensure that security policies regarding VO user management are known and being adhered to. Specifically we considered VO's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

---+++Questions to VOs
   1. Does your VO have an AUP in place that users have to agree to? If so, please provide us the appropriate link and update the entry on OIM. (Second part of question is asked if no appropriate link provided on OIM for the VO's AUP on OIM)
   2. Does your VO use a pilot job framework (e.g. glideinWMS) that allow users to get certificate free access to OSG?
   3. What procedures do you have in place so that the users are aware of and record their agreement to your VO's AUP?
   4. Are your users aware of the OSG AUP (http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86)?

---+++Responses from VOs
---++++DOSAR
(Horst Severini)

   1. We don't currently, since we have a very small user community and we literally know everyone personally, so we didn't think that was necessary until now.
   2. No, we do not.
   3. We don't, but see below.
   4. I had seen this before, but never really put much thought into it. But we should probably start using this for DOSAR in the future. Would that be okay? (Our answer was Yes)
---++++CSIU
(Scott Teige )

CSIU has no users. This will probably change at some point and we’ll be sure all of this is properly in place.
---++++glast.org
(Michael Kuss)

   1. Yes, we have an AUP, the entry on OIM is updated.
   2. The VO uses Grid resources through the DIRAC inter-ware. This software framework is extensively used by HEP communities and complies with security standards of LHC computing applications (DIRAC was developed by the LHCb experiment but has since matured to be entirely independent). As such, all DIRAC jobs use the DIRAC WMS which utilizes a pilot job framework (DIRACWMS). Access to OSG resources is only granted to users that authenticate themselves to the DIRAC server instance (which determines the role of each user). For the case of the glast dot org, jobs are submitted with shifter credentials (this is however not a robot certificate, but a real verifiable personal certificate).
   3. Users have to sign the AUP once a year.
   4. Strictly speaking of the link, we assume only those which have an OSG certificate have read the AUP of the link.  But, you may notice that the AUP's of the VO and of OSG are identical.  We also broadcast the explicit note of OSG of some months ago that, if not already obvious, bit coin mining on the grid is not allowed by any AUP.

---++++GPN
(Kate Adams)

   1. GPN does not have an acceptable use policy for OSG.
   2. No, we don't.
   3. N/A
   4. Unknown

GPN doesn't have a logon node (I forget the terminology). Our VO mostly signs certificates for a researcher and his students. I think all of their certs are expired.  Please let us know if we need an AUP and how to proceed.

---++++DayaBay
(Jason Lee )

We are no longer using and have disabled the Dayabay VO. 

---++++GLOW

   1. Link on OIM updated.
   2. Yes, glideinWMS.
   3.  For anyone who needs a VOMS proxy, we use VOMs.  Otherwise, I'm not sure we have anything in place to make glideinWMS users aware of the AUP.  
It should also be mentioned that all users who submit jobs at U Wisconsin to OSG should be subject to the UW's AUP: http://www.cio.wisc.edu/policies-responsibleuse.aspx 

---++++JLab
We currently do not have any users in the JLab VO; it is not active at this time. Users at our site are instead joining the GlueX VO.

---++++Geant4
   1. It does, and it should visible here: https://voms.cern.ch:8443/voms/geant4/aup/load.action;jsessionid=4ijy5m5ywdaf69xh5xzmhmjy
As a matter of fact I just noticed that the recent migration to VOMS-Admin didn't correctly propagate the AUP. The correct text should be

======================
 VO Acceptable Use Policy : Geant4

This acceptable Use Policy applies to all members of Geant4 Virtual Organization, hereafter referred to as the VO, with reference to use of the Grid infrastructure, hereafter referred to as the Grid. The Geant4 VO manager, who is appointed by the Steering Board of the Geant4 collaboration (interim VO manager is the Spokesperson Makoto Asai (SLAC)), owns and gives authority to this policy. The goal of the VO is to test and validate the software provided by the Geant4 collaboration. Both public (releases and beta releases available from Geant4 website) and development releases (internal to the collaboration) are tested and validated within the Grid environment. Only active members of the Geant4 collaboration can be part of the Geant4 VO. Members and Managers of the VO agree to be bound by the Grid Acceptable Usage Rules, VO Security Policy and other relevant Grid Policies, and to use the Grid only in the furtherance of the stated of the VO.
======================
   2.   AFAIK nowadays geant4 submits jobs via DIRAC, which is indeed a pilot job framework. I'm not sure if it is used to submit to any OSG resource: I hope that the other Andrea (in Cc:) can answer this.
   3.   Before the migration to VOMS-Admin, VOMRS was used and users were required to sign the AUP when they register and once every year after that. The migration just happened and I hope that the same requirement is implemented in the new system. I will check if this is the case.
   4.  In general, I would say no. Maybe US members know about it but not other users. I suspect this is an issue common to all WLCG VOs because I never saw in their AUPs a reference to the OSG AUP.
