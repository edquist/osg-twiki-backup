   * wrote the cigetcert [[https://git.io/vgcZm][man page]].   Converted almost all of the pyOpenSSL usage to m2crypto, which simplified things quite a bit (it does its own host cert & name verification) and made it portable all the way back to python2.4 & SLF5.  Still need to use pyOpenSSL for pkcs12->pem conversion.
   * added cigetcert to the list of FermiTools, and made its source code available on github.  It is now linked from the [[http://www.cilogon.org/ecp][CILogon ECP page]].
   * the kx509 package is next.  The SL team hasn't been answering my questions, I need to bug them.
   * I made a couple more suggested updates to the MyProxy requirements document.

   * OSG CA transition
      * Coordinated with Snoplus VO about the updates needed on February 9th to complete the transition to OSG CA. Gluex, Star and OSG have completed the steps needed for the transition. A note release was sent to GOC for the OIM-ITB release on February 2nd.
      * Gluex, Star and OSG VOs confirmed they have executed the steps to complete the transition in February 9th. 
      * VOs under Fermilab VO need to be updated in OIM to show the right certificate signer.
   * Globus GSI clients moving to STRICT_RFC2818 by default
      * Prepared a list of certificates issued for DigiCert with multiple FQDNs to find out if all certificates are compliant.
   * CERN CA down
      * Prepared an announcement to inform US CMS and Atlas users about the service outage due to an issue with the Hardware Security Model.
   * Changes in DNs for FNAL at CILogon Basic CA 
      * Solved questions about the impact of this change on current CILogon certificate holders.
   * Operations: No new vulnerabilities affecting OSG.
