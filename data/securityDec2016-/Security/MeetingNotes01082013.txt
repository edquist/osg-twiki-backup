---++ Meeting Minutes 

*Kevin*
   * Pakiti got reviewed. Mat reviewed it. Couple minor documentation issues. Need to find one more site admin to review it. ITB release next week. Final production release is on January 22nd. We need to find a person to review in the next couple days. This is the top priority. 
   * Incident at XSEDE at Caltech. there is a user with OSG credentials. Will email the user and ask if his certificate is on compromised servers. Initial attack vector was trough ssh daemon on an test machine. The test machine had access to nsf shares. attacker escalated to root on the test machine and able to put sniffers on the production servers. More users may be compromised. Will contact the user and ask if he ever use his OSG credentials on compromised servers. XSEDE has not revoked the credentials. 
   * Fermilab PKI project. One question is the update of the VOMS servers. Kevin will attend the OSG PKI meeting to ask his questions

*Anand*
   * Condor vulnerability. We have tickets opened with 14 sites.  5 sites have responded, but did not fix the problem. They told us their plans. The remaining sites either updated or applied the workaround. The vulnerability: http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/security/vulnerabilities/CONDOR-2012-0002.html (hostbased auth reverse DNS), http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/security/vulnerabilities/CONDOR-2012-0003.html (standard universe root escalation). Anand will run the test scripts for these two vulnerabilities again. 
   * CIlogon CA tests. Tested OIM-ITB, ticket-itb, mysog-itb. Test: got DN into the OIM account. I use CIlogon DN to login. Open a ticket and give them my Cilogon DN. once that happened, used CIlogon CA cert to login to the account. Twiki ITB -- did not work. Did not even have a chance to select CIlogon ca cert. Gratia web itb. we did not know what to test because this does not require authentication. Ask Scott if we can change the OIM process of manually adding DNs into a automated process.  Anand tested twiki production service with cilogon ca and it worked. Production OIM, ticket, and myosg also seem to recognize CIlogon Basic CA certs. It seems like GOC completely moved the changes into production. 
   * SHA-2 tests worked well. Everything in ITB at least tested fine. We also changed the process for OSG CA release into ITB and software testing cache. 
   * Had access to glidein test frontend at UCSD. was able to run jobs at the test frontend without any problem. very simple process. we just use condor submit, only use vanilla universe and do not specify a job manager.  

*Mine* 
   * CVMFS evaluation in February. 
   * Username password service evaluation. 
   * Cilogon push. get another 5 sites. 
   * Planing for OSG AHM.
