---+++Meeting Minutes
*Jim:*
   * Meeting DOEGrids on contingency planning. how to deal with outages longer than a week? cloning effort will take a while. this project gets interrupted by other esnet priorities. Organizational change is the highest risk; however, this cannot, normally happen without advance notice. having critical services replicated by both DOEgrids and NSF is another approach. NSF can provide funds to run a back up CA.  Doug explored the possibility of whether a CRL signed by a different ca? but this would not work.  
 
   * tested the remote queries (BNL logging project). meeting at 2 pm tomorrow. feature completion checkmark

   * discussion OSG removal statement. it can directly refer to AUP on most things. The statement includes the points that are not covered by the AUP. In addition, what security control should be applicable to VO and sites. should circumventing these controls be a reason for expulsion from OSG. if so, which controls are critical. Are there any other behavior we expect, such as reasonable cautions? 

*Igor:* 
   * is leaving this Friday. Jay finished the template. will work on the script for the template this week. 
   * Igor will look at the vdt getting rid of the vdt ca service

*Doug:* 
   * contingency planning is what happens if ca disappears. identify and prioritize the active users from gratia records.
   * gridadmin controls: getting the past records out of the ca database. downloaded the requests and ordered them into mysql. we can generate additional notifications and reports from the request database. esnet sends notifications to agents , but not enough notifications are sent to the users. e.g.,email the vo admin when a user is renewing a cert; report to manager when new certs are issued; report to VO admin when cert request is issued. 
   * access logs from doegrids will be retrieved possibly today

*Anand:* 
   * gLite authz service. downloaded the code. will test the code. promising in terms of written document. 
   * Mine will schedule the banning tool on stg. 
   * Arvind packaging the RSV. CA probe cannot be submitted as a globus job. rsv will not provide a function to for this. Anand will tak to Alain and get this into the next release. 

*Aashish:* 
   * grading and the compilation of the reports. 
   * replicating sven's code.
