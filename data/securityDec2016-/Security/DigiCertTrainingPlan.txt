---++DigiCert Training Plan

---+++ Learning Objectives
   This training plan is developed to educate the OSG Registration Agents (RA), Grid Admins (GA), and the Sponsors about the DigiCert CA certificate lifecycle processes. The training will teach the actions that must be taken by the RAs, GAs, Sponsors and will explain how to use the tools provided by OSG and Digicert CA.  
   This plan is not intended to educate OSG end users about the actions required of them during the certificate lifecycle.

---+++ Learning Methods and Activities
   The Digicert Planning Team will create the training materials in collaboration with Digicert CA team. The training has two methods: we will develop a training class and following the class we will provide a hands-on training session with the Digicert and OSG Portals. 

   For each trainee type (RA, GA, and Sponsor) a training class will be developed. The class will be based on a document that explains the actions required from the trainees and the tools provided for those actions. Once the class training is completed, the trainees will be asked to perform the basic tasks at Digicert web portal or at OSG portal. %BLUE% Can we set up training accounts at Digicert and OSG temporarily following our class?  %ENDCOLOR%

---++++ Training Class Logistics
   There are 45 GAs, 38 RAs, and 21 Sponsors. They are all geographically distributed. Therefore, we will perform the training class remotely.  We can provide our class as a webinar. The advantage of having a webinar is the real time interaction with the trainees. The trainer will share his desktop view and demonstrate how to navigate Digicert and OSG web portals, how to use certificate tools, and so on. For the kind of training we need to give this is much more useful than showing a static deck of power point slides. The downside of the webinars is that we have to find a web conferencing technology that all of the trainees will have easy access to. There are some webinar hosting companies that do not charge anything for small groups (<20). %BLUE% TODO: Find out which technology/company is the most suitable%ENDCOLOR% If we cannot find a webinar service, we may prepare a training video and play that during the training. 

   For each trainee type, due to the number of people, we should at least schedule two separate training classes (approximately 20 persons in each class). We should announce the dates a month ahead and set up a registration page. One way to ensure everyone is adequately trained is to delay activating a person's RA, GA, or Sponsor privileges until they attend the training class. If we provide a video or a webinar, another advantage is that we can allow attendees to use the tool on their own schedule. This will help people who cannot attend on scheduled training days. Another benefit is that they can always look up the information when they need it later. Given the number of people we have, having both interactive classes and on-demand (previously recorded) webinars are probably the best way for us.  

   We should use a registration system for keeping track of class dates and attendees. 
   In order to show how to use the OSG and/or DigiCert portals, we should schedule these class until after all software development work is completed. 
 
   For each trainee type, the class will teach them i) how they will serve end user requests; ii) how they will maintain their RA, GA, or Sponsor status with the system (requesting/renewing/destroying their privileges; gaining access to the system, and so on), and iii) the compliance/audit responsibilities they have with DigiCert and OSG (e.g. RA agreement forms, gaining DNS domain ownership letters for GAs, documentation of their actions; and so on).   

   * Action Items: 
      * Find a free easy-to use web conferencing tool.
      * Set up training schedules.
      * Set up a registration page for attendees.
      * Develop training materials. 

---++++ Hands-On Training 
   Each trainee will be asked to perform their responsibilities within a training account. this will allow them to actually use the tools provided to them. For example, an RA will be asked to submit, review, and approve a user certificate request. The training accounts will be requested from OSG CA portal and Digicert CA.  Depending on the account type, we may get an account for each trainee or have a generic training account where all trainees can share access. 
   * Action Items 
      * Inquire with OSG portal and Digicert CA whether training accounts can be set up.
 
---+++ Evidence of Completion / Documentation
   Are there any requirements from Digicert on documenting the completion of training by each attendee? If not then, we can activate the corresponding privileges of the trainees as they complete the training.
