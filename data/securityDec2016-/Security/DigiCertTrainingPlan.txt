---++New OSG PKI Training Plan


---+++ Learning Objectives
   This training plan is developed to educate the OSG Registration Agents (RA), Grid Admins (GA), and the Sponsors about the certificate lifecycle processes in the new OSG PKI. The training will teach the actions that must be taken by the RAs, GAs, Sponsors and will explain how to use the tools provided by OSG and Digicert CA.  
   This plan is not intended to educate OSG end users about the actions required of them during the certificate lifecycle.

---+++ Learning Methods and Activities
   The Digicert Planning Team will create the training materials in collaboration with Digicert CA team. The training has two methods: we will develop a training class and following the class we will provide a hands-on training session with the Digicert and OSG Portals. 

   For each trainee type (RA, GA, and Sponsor) a training class will be developed. The class will be based on a document that explains the actions required from the trainees and the tools provided for those actions. Once the class training is completed, the trainees will be asked to perform the basic tasks at Digicert web portal or at OSG portal. The PKI team will set up training accounts at OIM-ITB instance and will use Digicert Training CA as the back end CA. 

---+++Training Planning Team
   
   The team will need staff who can perform the following tasks. 
   * A person to develop training materials. This task will include finding remote conferencing tools, developing training video as needed. This should take 2-FTE weeks.   

   * A person who can conduct the training classes. It will be better if the same person who developed the training material can do the training. But, in case of a schedule conflict, a separate person can conduct the training sessions. There will be 5 training sessions planned. Each session is expected to take 2 hours. Thus, the trainer should dedicate at least 15-FTE hours just to conduct the sessions. 

   * An administrative support person to keep track of scheduling sessions, registering participants, keeping track of participants who has not signed up and so on. This should take 15-FTE hours. 

   * A technical support person who will set up the training accounts for the trainees, clean up the accounts after training and so on. He will also review the training content  existing technical setup. This should be a person from PKI team who is very familiar with the GOC and DigiCert portals and tools. This should take 15-FTE  hours.   

---+++ Timelines

   PKI project development is planned to be finished at 7/16/2012. The acceptance testing will be conducted until 9/17/2012. Internal staff testing will be conducted until 10/1/2012. After then friendly user testing will be allowed until 10/29/2012. After the end of October, the new PKI services will be open to OSG public. 

   The training tasks will be scheduled as follows. 

   * The training material development will start 8/01/2012. It should be completed by 9/20/2012. 
   * Administrative tasks, such as setting up a registration web page, announcing the training dates, should start 8/10/2012. 
   * Technical setup tasks, such as setting a test CA and accounts, should start 9/17/2012 and should be completed by 10/1/2012. Some of these tasks that require programming should be performed during the PKI development phase. 
   * Technical review of the training material. This should be performed as the material is being developed. The person developing the material should do this under constant consultation with the technical team. A formal review should be performed after 9/17 till 9/24/2012.  
   * Training sessions should be held from 10/1/2012 until 10/29/2012. Each week a training session should be held. Because we plan to have 5 sessions, we will have two sessions during one week. We will schedule the same type of training sessions as far apart from one another. 
      * A tentative schedule is: 
         * RA Training sessions: 10/1 and 10/22
         * GA Training sessions: 10/8 and 10/26
         * Sponsor Training session: 10/15 
          


---++++ Training Class Logistics
   There are 45 GAs, 38 RAs, and 21 Sponsors. They are all geographically distributed. Therefore, we will perform the training class remotely.  We can provide our class as a webinar. The advantage of having a webinar is the real time interaction with the trainees. The trainer will share his desktop view and demonstrate how to navigate Digicert and OSG web portals, how to use certificate tools, and so on. For the kind of training we need to give this is much more useful than showing a static deck of power point slides. The downside of the webinars is that we have to find a web conferencing technology that all of the trainees will have easy access to. There are some webinar hosting companies that do not charge anything for small groups (<20). %BLUE% TODO: Find out which technology/company is the most suitable%ENDCOLOR% If we cannot find a webinar service, we may prepare a training video and play that during the training. 

   For each trainee type, due to the number of people, we should at least schedule two separate training classes (approximately 20 persons in each class). We should announce the dates a month ahead and set up a registration page. One way to ensure everyone is adequately trained is to delay activating a person's RA, GA, or Sponsor privileges until they attend the training class. If we provide a video or a webinar, another advantage is that we can allow attendees to use the tool on their own schedule. This will help people who cannot attend on scheduled training days. Another benefit is that they can always look up the information when they need it later. Given the number of people we have, having both interactive classes and on-demand (previously recorded) webinars are probably the best way for us.  

   We should use a registration system for keeping track of class dates and attendees. 
   In order to show how to use the OSG and/or DigiCert portals, we should schedule these class until after all software development work is completed. 
 
   For each trainee type, the class will teach them i) how they will serve end user requests; ii) how they will maintain their RA, GA, or Sponsor status with the system (requesting/renewing/destroying their privileges; gaining access to the system, and so on), and iii) the compliance/audit responsibilities they have with DigiCert and OSG (e.g. RA agreement forms, gaining DNS domain ownership letters for GAs, documentation of their actions; and so on).   

   * Action Items: 
      * Find a free easy-to use web conferencing tool.
      * Set up training schedules.
      * Set up a registration page for attendees.
      * Develop training materials. 

---++++ Hands-On Training 
   Each trainee will be asked to perform their responsibilities within a training account. This will allow them to actually use the tools provided to them. For example, an RA will be asked to submit, review, and approve a user certificate request. The training accounts will be requested from OSG CA portal and Digicert CA.  Depending on the account type, we may get an account for each trainee or have a generic training account where all trainees can share access. 
   * Action Items 
      * Inquire with OSG portal and Digicert CA whether training accounts can be set up.
 
---+++ Evidence of Completion / Documentation
   
   The Section 5.3.3 of the OSG/DigiCert RPS (quoted below) is one of the drivers for this training. By completing this training program, OSG and its staff will  meet the requirements laid forth in the Section 5.3.3 of the OSG/DigiCert RPS. OSG will maintain records of who received the training and what level of training was completed. OSG will store and provide these records to DigiCert upon request. OSG will devise a process for providing this training on an ongoing basis.  OSG will activate the corresponding privileges of the trainees as they complete the training.
