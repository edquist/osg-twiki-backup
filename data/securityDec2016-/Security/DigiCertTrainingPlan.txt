---++New OSG PKI Training Plan

---+++ Learning Objectives
   This training plan is developed to educate the OSG Registration Agents (RA) and Grid Admins (GA) about the certificate lifecycle processes in the new OSG PKI. The training will teach the actions that must be taken by the RAs and GAs and will explain how to use the tools provided by OSG and Digicert CA.  
   This plan is not intended to educate OSG end users about the actions required of them during the certificate lifecycle.

---+++ Learning Methods and Activities
   The training has two methods: we will develop a training class and following the class we will provide a hands-on training session. We will use Adobe Connect tool to deliver the online training classes.

   For each trainee type (RA and GA) a training class will be developed. The class will be based on a document that explains the actions required from the trainees and the tools provided for those actions. Once the class training is completed, the trainees will be asked to perform the basic tasks. The PKI Transition team will set up training accounts at OIM-ITB instance and will use Digicert Test CA as the back end CA. 

---+++Training Planning Team
   
   The team will need staff who can perform the following tasks. 
   * A person to develop training materials. This task will include finding remote conferencing tools, developing training video as needed. This should take 2-FTE weeks.   

   * A person who can conduct the training classes. It will be better if the same person who developed the training material can do the training. But, in case of a schedule conflict, a separate person can conduct the training sessions. There will be 5 training sessions planned. Each session is expected to take 2 hours. Thus, the trainer should dedicate at least 15-FTE hours just to conduct the sessions. 

   * An administrative support person to keep track of scheduling sessions, registering participants, keeping track of participants who has not signed up and so on. This should take 15-FTE hours. 

   * A technical support person who will set up the training accounts for the trainees, clean up the accounts after training and so on. He will also review the training content  existing technical setup. This should be a person from PKI team who is very familiar with the GOC and DigiCert portals and tools. This should take 15-FTE  hours.   

---+++ Timelines

   PKI project development is planned to be finished at 7/16/2012. The acceptance testing will be conducted until 9/17/2012. Internal staff testing will be conducted until 10/1/2012. After then friendly user testing will be allowed until 10/29/2012. After the end of October, the new PKI services will be open to OSG public. 

   The training tasks will be scheduled as follows. 

   * The training material development will be completed by 9/24/2012. 
   * Administrative tasks, such as setting up a registration web page, announcing the training dates will start immediately. 
   * Technical setup tasks, such as setting a test CA and accounts, should start 9/17/2012 and should be completed by 10/1/2012. Some of these tasks that require programming should be performed during the PKI development phase. 
   * Technical review of the training material. This should be performed as the material is being developed. The person developing the material should do this under constant consultation with the technical team. A formal review should be performed after 9/17 till 9/24/2012.  
   * Training sessions will be held from 10/1/2012 until 10/29/2012. Each week a training session should be held. Because we plan to have 5 sessions, we will have two sessions during one week. We will schedule the same type of training sessions as far apart from one another. 
      * A tentative schedule is: 
         * RA Training sessions: 10/1 and 10/22
         * GA Training sessions: 10/8 and 10/26
      * Scheduling conflicts:
         * Jim Basney: Internet2 meeting (Oct 1-5), OGF36 (Oct 8-12)

---++++ Training Class Logistics
   There are 45 GAs and 38 RAs. They are all geographically distributed. Therefore, we will perform the training class remotely.  We can provide our class as a webinar. The advantage of having a webinar is the real time interaction with the trainees. The trainer will share his desktop view and demonstrate how to navigate Digicert and OSG We plan to use Adobe Connect.

   For each trainee type, due to the number of people, we will at least schedule two separate training classes (approximately 20 persons in each class). We should announce the dates a month ahead and set up a registration page. One way to ensure everyone is adequately trained is to delay activating a person's RA or GA privileges until they attend the training class. If we provide a video or a webinar, another advantage is that we can allow attendees to use the tool on their own schedule. This will help people who cannot attend on scheduled training days. Another benefit is that they can always look up the information when they need it later. Given the number of people we have, having both interactive classes and on-demand (previously recorded) webinars are probably the best way for us.  

   We will use a registration system (Indico) for keeping track of class dates and attendees. 
   In order to show how to use the OSG and/or DigiCert portals, we should schedule these class until after all software development work is completed. 
 
   For each trainee type, the class will teach them i) how they will serve end user requests; ii) how they will maintain their RA or GA status with the system (requesting/renewing/destroying their privileges; gaining access to the system, and so on), and iii) the compliance/audit responsibilities they have with DigiCert and OSG (e.g. RA agreement forms, gaining DNS domain ownership letters for GAs, documentation of their actions; and so on).   

---++++ Action Items: 
      * Setup Adobe Connect for web conferencing. Mine got hosting privileges. Hosted a test session. Requested hosting privileges for Jim from Marco Mambelli.
         * test recording capabilities of Adobe Connect for later use. 
      * Set up a registration page for attendees in Indico. Complete.
      * Announce training schedules. Make sure that announcements reach the target audience. Work with GOC to verify the recipient list for the announcements sent by GOC team. Jim emailed Von to send the announcements to RA/GA.
      * Check if all attendees registered and all the domains needed are in OIM ITB already. The list of current OSG RA/GAs are at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/OsgRaAgents. 
      * Verify if sponsors need any training. Completed. Sponsors will not receive any training. 
      * Develop training materials. We decided to show the training steps in Adobe Connect in live sessions and record these sessions for later use. We will produce as little document as possible except for the training videos.  
      * Verify the RA/GA processes with PKI team: how to become an RA/GA, how to perform as a RA/GA. Continuing. 
      * The training team will provide a dry run of the training class during the week of 9/24
      * Find out what we need to do to distribute the command line client tools to the GAs before the training event. OSG software team should provide the client tools in the week of Sept 17 to the trainers so the trainers would have time to test them.

---++++ Hands-On Training 
   Each trainee will be asked to perform their responsibilities within a training account. This will allow them to actually use the tools provided to them. For example, an RA will be asked to submit, review, and approve a user certificate request. The training accounts will be requested from OSG CA portal and Digicert CA.  Depending on the account type, we may get an account for each trainee or have a generic training account where all trainees can share access. 

 
---+++ Evidence of Completion / Documentation
   
   The Section 5.3.3 of the OSG/DigiCert RPS (quoted below) is one of the drivers for this training. By completing this training program, OSG and its staff will  meet the requirements laid forth in the Section 5.3.3 of the OSG/DigiCert RPS. OSG will maintain records of who received the training and what level of training was completed. OSG will store and provide these records to DigiCert upon request. OSG will devise a process for providing this training on an ongoing basis.  OSG will activate the corresponding privileges of the trainees as they complete the training.
