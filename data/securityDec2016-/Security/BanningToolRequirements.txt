---+ Banning Service Use Cases & Requirements

A Banning Service is often referred to as a black-list: a list of entities that is not allowed access to the resources.This wiki-page documents the use cases and requirements for such a banning service for OSG and should help determine the right path forward in adopting and/or development of such a tool.
---+++ Use Cases:

---+++ Requirements:

Our high level requirements from a banning tool:

   1 Banning information propagated accross sites and VOs
      * When a user is banned at a certain site because her account has been compromised, and that same user also has access to OSG's resources, then we want that information to be propagate/shared.
      * 
   1 Relying parties should be able to trust only a local (VO-) banning service that aggregates the banning info from other sites.
      * otherwise resources will have to trust all banning-authorities from all sites, which is a "challenging" administrative requirement.
   1 Banning service interface should be pluggable into different authorization services 
   1 easy to write policies 
   1 coherent across a site 
   1 GUMS is a VO policy enforcement while banning tool is a site policy enforcement 
   1 propagation delay across a site is much more sensitive 
   1 receives feedback from a grid-central location 
   1 being able to ban entities, users, certs, proxies, FQAN, or VOs and easily restore access 
   1 easier auditing: having explicit policy rules that shows the negative permissions 
   1 high number of access requests per minute --(having simple policy)
