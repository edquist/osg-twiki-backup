   * Still working on rebuilding ca cert bundles. Didn't hear back from Tim about whether or not we should release new new-format packages as well. Need to double check dependencies.
   * Updating the CA package to the new layout. Only 3 VOs have the old VOMS version. Will email the VO admins and then email the OSG staff.
   * New VO training with CTA scheduled for Thursday 9am.
   * NTP DDOS Advisory sent. When Perfsonar releases the patch, we will send an update to our sites. 
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Will evaluate security of perfSonar test box at GOC and the perfSonar dashboard. Still need to set up test vms.
   * Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0 after New Year.

   * Created a wiki page to document traceability work with CHTC/GLOW VO. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CHTCJobWithoutCerts
      * Our goal is to get jobs from CHTC controlled submit nodes to be submitted to FNAL.
      * Anand will follow up with GLOW and setup a discussion to make this happen. We also plan to conduct a security drill to see if there is enough information in the condor logs at the frontend to trace it back to a submit node.
      * Mine had new information on an OSG accounting project based on her discussion with Chander. All jobs coming from OSG VO to FNAL have a information about the scientific nature of the job. FNAL will like to have similar information for jobs coming from GLOW. We are trying to understand what exactly this means. Mine will follow up with Chander to clarify the question we discussed. 
   * Anand will look into a ticket: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OO-19 on Jira
