   * Script to add CILogon OSG CA certs to existing VOMS users appears to work on test system with copy of fermilab database, although had expired service cert, so couldn't actually test a voms-proxy-init. Will try to replace cert to confirm. Will document usage and general migration steps.

   * Setup a CVMFS client before the security drill.
   * Managing SDSC request: need to trust FNAL. DigiCert CA is available on the OSG bundle. OSG CA needs to be in the XSEDE bundle.
