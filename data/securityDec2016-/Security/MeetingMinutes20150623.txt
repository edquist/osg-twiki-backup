   * Script to add CILogon OSG CA certs to existing VOMS users appears to work on test system with copy of fermilab database, although had expired service cert, so couldn't actually test a voms-proxy-init. Will try to replace cert to confirm. Will document usage and general migration steps.
   * it seems there are 2 vomses file for fermilab vos. And gums does not seem to care about the voms DN as long as it is a valid certificate. Kevin will test this idea. We should test edgmkgridmap file.

   * KCA replacement
      * We talked with Jim Basney and decided that we could use ECP by getting a 3 week certificate but not storing it to disk; instead, we create a 3 week proxy to send to jobsub and a 1 week proxy to keep for the user on the submit machine, and throw away the cert

   * Automatic grid proxy renewal for CMS transfers between T1 and T2 sites
      * Instructions are confusing: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhedexAdminDocsInstallation?redirectedfrom=CMS.PhedexAdminDocsInstallation#Certificate_Management
   * Working on setup jobsub client in a non-FNAL machine.
      * Jobsub used to be distributed in tarball to install out of FNAL network. Last versions, not tarballs available.
   * Setup a CVMFS client before the security drill.
   * Managing SDSC request: need to trust FNAL. DigiCert CA is available on the OSG bundle. OSG CA needs to be in the XSEDE bundle.
   * Local area for OPOS group stuck, request for UNIX group has not been made.
