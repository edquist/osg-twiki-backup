---+ Log Files relevant to security analyses

The log files generated by services in the OSG software provide valuable diagnostic information for a variety of uses, including incident response and analysis. A complete list of *log files* and their *locations* is intended to be shown at <strong> ReleaseDocumentation.LogFiles </strong>. Below is a short description of the ones particularly relevent to analysis of security incidents. Depending on the nature of the incident it is likely that other files are needed for in-depth analysis but these are the ones to check for initial access to services.

| *Service or Process* | *Filename* | *Description* |
| GRAM | globus-gatekeeper.log | contains authentication and job state change information for jobs submitted to the CE |
| gridftp | gridftp-auth.log  | has authentication information for files transfered through the gridftp server |
| WS-GRAM | container-real.log | has authentication information for jobs submitted through the web services GRAM service |
