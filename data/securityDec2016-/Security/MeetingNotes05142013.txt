---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * RedHat 6 zero day vulnerability came out this morning. Any authenticated local user can be elevated to root. Exploit is publicly available and very easy to use. It works on SL6 verified. Kevin ran this successfully on SL6. mitigation works for published exploit. But there are still possible exploits. We will send out the announcement asap.
   * Long-lived proxy documentation. Finishing up the formal documentation. 
   * Documentation. Eliminate the redundant pages. 
   * Fermilab PKI. No problems. 
   * CIlogon. Found couple of VOs. We will have the meeting with CSIU and UC3. We need a more coherent plan for CIlogon adoption. Kevin is working on the plan. 
   * SHA-2 conversion is postponed to October 1st 2013. Kevin thinks there is a problem with sha-2 signed CRLs. He will find the errors.
