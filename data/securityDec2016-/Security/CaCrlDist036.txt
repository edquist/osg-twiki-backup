---+ Understanding the CA-Certificates package

This page has the status of my analysis of the CA-Certificates package distribution in OSG 0.3.6. - D. Olson

---++ CRL status Table

The following tables lists CAs for which I did not get a CRL, either because the .crl_url file is not provided in the distribution or because fetching the CRL failed for some reason.


| *CA* | *has crl_url?* | *is CRL published by CA* | *CN* | *Where* | *Still in use?* |
