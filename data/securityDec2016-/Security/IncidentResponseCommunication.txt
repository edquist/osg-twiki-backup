---+ Incident Response Communication in OSG

The OSG Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) requires mechanisms to facilitate the appropriate handling of sensitive and private data related to computer security incidents.
Essential components of these mechanisms include authentication (to verify the identity of incident responders), access control (to ensure that sensitive and private incident data is accessible only to responders involved in an incident on a need-to-know basis), and encryption (to avoid eavesdropping on sensitive and private data at rest and as it moves across the network).
Sensitive data must be protected from disclosure to adversaries who may use it to attack systems and disrupt the incident response process.
Private data about users must be protected from disclosure to avoid identity theft and other personal privacy invasions.

This page documents available mechanisms and proposes the adoption of new mechanisms and procedures.
This is a draft for discussion and does not represent official OSG policy.

---++ Incident Reporting

The email address for reporting security incidents to OSG is security@opensciencegrid.org.
An [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting][Incident Reporting Form]] is also available.
On submission, the form posts a cleartext email message to the current OSG security officer.

Current best practice for CSIRTs is to publish a public key for receiving encrypted security incident reports.
For example:
   * http://www.cert.org/contact_cert/encryptmail.html
   * http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html
   * http://www.redhat.com/security/team/key/
   * http://www.apple.com/support/security/pgp/
Supporting encrypted incident reports would encourage appropriate disclosure of incident information to the OSG CSIRT.
Without an avenue for encrypted communication with the OSG CSIRT, incident reporters may be barred by local policy from sharing incident logs and other sensitive/private incident details with OSG.

*RECOMMENDATIONS*
   * Publish a public PGP key and S/MIME certificate for security@opensciencegrid.org. OSG GOC personnel should have access to the associated private key(s) for decrypting incoming messages.
   * The Incident Reporting Form should be modified to use HTTPS post rather than cleartext email.

---++ Security Advisories

Security advisories and other announcements and instructions from OSG security and operations personnel must be trustworthy.
OSG security and operations personnel may require prompt action by site administrators for containment of a security incident.
Furthermore, site administrators should be protected from phishing attacks or other security exploits that involve spoofed messages claiming to come from OSG personnel.
