   * Kyle has had trouble getting permissions to work on new SecurityTeamWorkingArea web, said he needs more time.
   * Contrary to what I had been told, OSG CA DNs are automatically getting registered in OIM when people renew their Digicert-Grid certs before they expire.
   * WLCG Isolation: Brian B has had great success with slightly modifying an existing tool from LBL called "singularity".  It is normally setuid-root, but Brian made a patch to get it to work as a user on newer kernels that support it.  He also made patches to enable it to start from a CVMFS filesystem tree for the O.S. instead of an image file, and to mount a user's scratch space in its original location, hiding the rest of the files belonging to the pilot.  He made a shell script wrapper that makes it a drop-in replacement for glexec in a condor-based system such as GlideinWMS.
   * I made another new cigetcert release this week (so far in /grid/fermiapp ups test only) that fixes a problem when a client machine's clock is skewed into the future, and adds support for the $X509_CERT_DIR environment variable for CA certs & CRLs.  Also added an SL7 installation in ups of the current & test versions.
   * Found a problem with myproxy generating GT3 rather than RFC proxies with service certs.  The workaround is to use myproxy-init rather than myproxy-store when storing them, so it generates an extra RFC proxy in the chain.  The root cause was fixed in an EPEL globus library in December and OSG hadn't yet updated the library.  They plan to do so for the September OSG release.

   * Performed testing on OSG BDII ITB regarding the vulnerability announced in OpenLDAP. 
      * This vulnerability allows unauthenticated remote DoS. By sending a tampered message, OpenLDAP daemon crashes.
      * https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30708
   * Vulnerabilities reported in Perfsonar: Shawn McKee already confirmed that the version installed in OSG's Perfsonar instances is 3.5.1.4 contains the security updates.
      * https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30595
   * Globus GSSAPI Name compatibility (strict mode) implementation coming into OSG Software stack. Software Team wants to make sure all the site admins know about the implications.  Meeting today with Mats Selmecy and Scott Teige.
   * Security Training for VOs: new version ready to be published in DocDB. 
   * Working on HEPCloud Risk Assessment
      * Summary with attacks types on AWS 
   * Through condor_ce_trace and condor_ce_run, I got to contact the CEs and retrieve resources info prior to submission, but actual submission is still unsuccessful.
