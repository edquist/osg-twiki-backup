   * Test certificate for SHA2 intermediate CA is supposed to come today.  OSG 3.1 hasn't had any updates since April, but we'll need to warn people to upgrade before new certs start being issued.
   * I suggest that Fermilab stick with Shibboleth !IdP but get a different company to provide support
