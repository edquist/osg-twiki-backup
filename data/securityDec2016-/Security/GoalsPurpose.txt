---++ Security Goals and Purpose

%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%

The security team&#8217;s goal is to provide a security framework that enables science and promotes autonomous and open science collaboration among VOs, sites, and software providers. Keeping the balance between the openness, which is necessary for science, and the security is at the core of our work. We achieve our goals by providing:  

   * *operational security:* keeping an active dialogue with our members; evaluating the security of our software stack and releasing timely patches for identified vulnerabilities; observing the practices of our VOs and sites, and sending alerts when we detect abnormalities; continually performing fire drills to measure readiness and security awareness

   * *interoperability with other grids:* working with JSPG  and IGTF  to develop common security policies; participating into EGEE&#8217;s operational security and incident response teams. 

   * *education:* security training of our members; teaching best practices, and learning from our users about difficulties of security practices
