---++ Meeting Minute 09/06/2011

*Jim* 
   * Tomcat and Apache vulnerability. We will release the Apache tomorrow unless we hear anything about Tomcat. Tomcat 7.x is patched on September 1st. But no word on Tomcat 5.X series.
   * Kernel.org vulnerability. similar to previous phalanx attacks. An attack machine is found to be in Europe. Uses the Phalanx rootkit. It seems like the same guy who attacked the grid several times. No total cleanups at kernel.org yet. Leif got the compromise email somehow and recognized that this is the phalanx intrusion. Romain,  Leif,  Jim Barlow had a conference call about phalanx and kernel.org. Leif discovered that compromised machines are still up. Attack vector is remote credential comrpomise. admin desktop has been compromised. 
   * send out the VDT STE results to Jim

*Anand*
   * wrote the documentation. ca-manage code is fine. not sure about cert-scripts. 
   * does not understand what provides-for stand for in rpm packages. 
   * if all the sites passes the test for the new ca layout, then we can only make the new format ca layout available at the koji
   * Will update the content for the new layout. md5sums. Then ask Steve Timm and Burt to transition. 
   * Mike still has not given a new certificate for the new crl_url location. Today or tomorrow. 
   * create a ticket on Ian's request. 
   * ticket 10911 is resolved. Anand cannot reproduce the problem. 
   * Rob Snihur's ticket. Ste admin had difficulty getting service cert because he followed the instructions from doegrids web site. 
    
*Marco*
   * 10898 is a documentation issue. Rob Snihur's ticket. He followed the instructions from doegrids web site. 
   * Contact Rob Snihur about updating cms users. 
   * end user certificate documentation is up on the twiki. Needs testing.
