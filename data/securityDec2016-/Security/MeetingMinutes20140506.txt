   * Preliminary meeting with HCC VO representatives (Derek and Emelie) to discuss the certificate-free access to OSG (particularly FNAL resources)
      * HCC has a portal from where most users submit jobs. Jobs are flocked to a gliedein frontend.
      * Two factor authentication used.
      * Users have to physically present themselves at HCC to get account on their systems.
   * Also Followed up with SBGrid VO to evaluate requirements of certificate free storage access
      * Detailed email response below
  <verbatim>
Most of our users who request certificates do so to use the WENMR service at:
https://www.wenmr.eu/

I believe that very few of our user runs jobs on OSG directly. 99% of our OSG jobs are run on behalf of our users using my user 
certificate. User submit jobs via our Web Portal at: https://portal.sbgrid.org/d/

And we then run jobs for very specific workflows and provide them the results via the Web interface.

Generally we prefer to use the LCG Utilities, then SRM. We rarely use gsiftp or Globus.

We are interested in running jobs without having to use certificates as it will make our lives easier and it may also make it easier for our users to access and use the OSG. 
Also, we're very interested in OSG Connect and may utilize it in the future and will recommend it to our users.
