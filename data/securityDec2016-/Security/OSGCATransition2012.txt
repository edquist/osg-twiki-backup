---+ OSG CA Transition

We in Open Science Grid operate a public key infrastructure (PKI) as part
of our identity management services, the goal of which is to allow for
authentication of users and services, and to allow for the expression of
virtual organization (VO) membership.
A key component is a certificate authority (CA), currently operated by
ESNET: the DOE Grids CA.  OSG now has an agreement with ESNET and DOE ASCR
to transition support for this functionality, with the goal to have a smooth
transition without affecting the quality and availability of the service to
the OSG users. 

OSG has been working with ESNET to develop and evaluate the options and
present a recommendation on the path to proceed. The recommended path is to
prototype outsourcing the CA to a commercial company, !DigiCert and then if
successful, utilize !DigiCert to replace the ESNet CA in the OSG PKI.  A
pilot project phase for this path is being actively pursued and an initial
agreement with !DigiCert for use of their certificates in this phase has been
reached.  The "OSG CA Activity" is led by Von Welch of Indiana University
with a team including Mine Altunay, Jim Basney and Chander Sehgal.

The pilot project plan includes acquiring both user and host certificates
from !DigiCert and testing them in the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB) with
several different applications from the main OSG communities. We will also
be testing  with the OSG processes such as the Registration Authority
Interface and scripts that obtain host certificates.The goal is for OSG to
implement a replacement for the DOE Grids CA into production in about a
year, with a further year for the ramp down of all OSG dependence on DOE
Grids CA services.

---++ Frequently Asked Questions


---+++I heard !DigiCert CA is a commercial CA. Does this transition mean that my local site will pay for certificates?

No, OSG's contract with !DigiCert will allow certificates to be issued to OSG participants at no additional cost.

---+++Wasn't !DigiCert recently compromised?

No. The CA that was compromised was !Digicert Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian company which has no relationship with the U.S. company !DigiCert based in Utah. Quoting from the [[http://www.entrust.net/advisories/malaysia.htm][Entrust advisory]]:

<blockquote>Digicert Sdn. Bhd. (Digicert Malaysia) is a certificate authority based in Malaysia. There is no relationship to !DigiCert Inc. based in Utah, US.</blockquote>

---+++Will DOEGrids CA stop operations soon? What will happen to my certificate from DOEgrids CA if they disappear?

DOEGrids CA will not cease operations abruptly. OSG and ESNet managements are working closely to develop a transition plan. The transition plan covers all the steps to ensure that OSG users are  unaffected by the change. The complete transition will take at least a year for integrating !DigiCert CA into OSG infrastructure and another year for ramping down DOEGrids CA operations. Both OSG and ESNet will provide periodic updates to user community about their progress. 

OSG users will continue to use their DOEGrids certificates as usual during the transition period. We will not revoke any DOEgrids CA certificates until we ensure that OSG users have obtained new certificates from !DigiCert CA. 


---+++What does this transition mean for the end user? What does the end user need to do to get new certificates?

End users are not required to take any action for now. Once the initial integration with !DigiCert complete, OSG and ESNet managements will send updates to the user community with the specific instructions. We will make sure that there is sufficient overlap between the end of !DOEGrids CA operation and !DigiCert CA integration. End users will not have any time period where they will have no access to any certificates. 


---+++I am a !GridAdmin/RA Agent for DOEGrids CA. Will I have the same privileges with !DigiCert CA? If so, will you require anything from my home institution?

Yes, !DigiCert CA has a very similar infrastructure to DOEGrids CA. You will continue to act as a !GridAdmin with !DigiCert CA. 
Your home institution is not required to do anything for you to obtain this privilege with !DigiCert. 

---+++Will the new OSG/DigiCert certificates be trusted by browsers so we don't get all sorts of warnings popping up?

No. During the Pilot, it was decided it made sense to separate OSG's need for Grid certificates from OSG's need for web server certificates. This will make the process of getting Grid certificates for users much simpler. Hence OSG Grid certificates will be obtained from the !DigiCert Grid CA (http://www.digicert-grid.com/) and not their normal commercial CA.
