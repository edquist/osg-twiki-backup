--+++ DOEGrids CA new cert request and renewal problems. 

At approximately 10pm EDT on Monday, April 2, 2012, users began experiencing problems obtaining new certificates and renewing existing ones from DOEGrids servers.  This is affecting both the certificate scripts and the web interface.

Below is our plan should this outage continue for more than 4 days (end of weekend). 

1) Find out all certs who scheduled to expire April 1st and has not been renewed. 
2) Contact those users with instructions. 
 
For people certs

1) Send all CMS and Atlas users to CERN CA for personal certificates
2) For remaining users, send them to CILOgon CA if they can use Nebraska and UCSD sites. 
3) For any other user, talk to NERSC CA whether if they issue personal certs. 
4) Contact VOMS admins with new cert DN so that users can be added into VOMS. 


For service certs:
1) Ask NCSA to provide service certs. CERN, FermiKCA and CILogon are out of the question as they do not issue service certs. 
2) If NCSA refuses to issue, ask ED's approval to buy individual certs from commercial CAs. Ask Digicert CA whether they can issue production CAs for our service certs. 
3) If requesting institution is a member fo InCommon and paid for service certificate service, then send them to use InCommon service cert service. 
4) for worker ndoes who does not use glexec, there is no need to request a service certificate. 
5) the new version of gums has a feature that does not require a worker node to have a service certificate. Put dcoumentation on how to turn on this feature.
