---++ Project Plan for Streamlining CA Release Process
---+++ Problem Statement
The OSG CA certificates are released to RPM format to both GOC (old OSG RPM repository) and the new OSG repository. Since the RPM release to GOC predated the OSG RPM effort (and our use of Koji), the old RPMs that are created do not follow the standards we use on Koji. Furthermore supporting multiple production RPMs will cause the release process to be error prone and cause confusion to user.

---+++ Goal
   * Merge two separate RPM releases to GOC and Koji and streamline the process of preparing the release 

---+++ People Involved
   * Security Team: Anand, Mine (Lead)
   * GOC: Rob Q, Scott T
   * VDT: Alain

---+++ Deliverables from the project:
   * Updated process of creating a CA distribution.
   * Changes will be documented at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CreatingCADistributions]]
   * Updates to the scripts/ RPM spec files used in the CA creation process as needed.
   * Prepare instruction for sites to do the transition.

---+++ Logistics
   * Effort: 2-3 FTE week, no extra effort needed
   * Project start : Mid January
   * Project End Date: End of Feb (Will be released to production early march)
   
---+++Project implementation Plan 
   * Get a list of sites that are using the repositories at GOC. (GOC - Completed.  Scott send us the list)
   * Contact the sites using the repository to get their input. (Anand - Emails sent to sites) Expected Completion: 2/10
   * Formulate a transition plan for deprecating the GOC RPM repository, (Anand - Underway, Rob, Mine and Alain will be consulted and sign off)  Expected Completion: 2/10
         * GOC decides the dates for rolling the changes to ITB and production release (Rob and Scott) Expected ITB: 3/6, Expected Production: 3/13
      * Update the CA release process documentation on twiki  (Anand) Expected Completion: 2/28
      * Update CA release scripts, RPM spec files as needed (Anand) Expected Completion: 2/28
   * Send out a broad announcement OSG community (Anand, Mine) Expected Completion: 2/20 
   * Develop instruction for sites to move to new repository. (Anand, Alain, Scott) Expected Completion: 2/28
   * Deprecating GOC repository (5/31)

---+++ Dependencies/ Risks
   * Need to work with GOC to push the transition plan to production. Some effort on GOC side needed to implement the changes to the RPM repositories.
   * If a significant stakeholder using GOC repository objects to the transition the process may be delayed

---+++ Affected Parties
   * This change will affect anyone (primarily OSG resource admins) using RPM (Yum) packages from repositories at GOC.
