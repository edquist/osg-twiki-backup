---++ Project Plan for Streamlining CA Release Process
---+++ Problem Statement
The OSG CA certificates are released to RPM format to both GOC (old OSG RPM repository) and the new OSG S/W repository. Since the RPM release to GOC predated the OSG RPM effort (and our use of Koji), the old RPMs that are created do not follow the standards we use on Koji. Furthermore supporting multiple production RPMs will cause the release process to be error prone and cause confusion to user.

---+++ Goal
   * Merge two separate RPM releases to GOC and Koji and streamline the process of preparing the release 

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand, Mine (Lead)
   * GOC: Rob Q, Scott T
   * VDT: Alain

---+++ Deliverables from the project:
   * Updated process of creating a CA distribution.
      * Changes will be documented at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CreatingCADistributions]].
   * Updates to the scripts/ RPM spec files used in the CA creation process as needed.
   * Instructions for sites to do the transition.

---+++ Schedule
   * Effort: 2 FTE week, no extra effort needed
   * Project start : January 15, 2012
   * Project End Date: May 31, 2012
      * Development Phase ends: Feb 28, 2012
      * Deprecation of GOC service: May 31, 2012

---++++ Additional Notes

   * One of the big concerns is that we are switching the CA bundle layout from old to new as part of this streamlining. The new layout has been available in the new software repo (via Koji) for a while. The new layout had no problems with vdt software stack except for the VOMS. Whereas GOC's old software repo still provides rpms in the old format. We were concerned that a site which uses GOC old repo may switch to new layout and it can break its software especially if the site uses VOMS. We contacted each site that uses GOC old repo and asked them what software they run. All of the contacted sites found to be running software that is proven to work well with new layout. 

---+++ Dependencies/ Risks

---+++ Affected Parties
   * This change will affect anyone (primarily OSG resource admins) using RPM (Yum) packages from repositories at GOC.
