---++ Kevin
   1 OSG CATests. 
      * Finished OIM functionality testing.
      * Move CILogon OSG CA cert to separate rpm?
   1 Fermilab KCA to Cilogon Basic CA transition. 
      * Talked to Olga. They are looking for a new IDP support vendor. Will ask about kerberos support in the process.
   1 Investigated lshell vulnerabilities. 
      * Talked to Nate Paul. Does not appear to be any unpatched vulnerabilities in lshell. May not be suitable for critical system protection, but given that a user could do anything in a submitted job, lshell should be suitable.
   1 Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill.
   * Oasis master key replication. Scott wants someone else to have a copy of the master key. Rob will have a copy. Kevin reviewed the plan and ok with it. One important vulnerability is when Scott uses the master key to sign the intermediate keys, it gets copied into the file system. He needs to manually delete it afterwards. Kevin will check if Scott does this and if Scott has a well-documented process.
