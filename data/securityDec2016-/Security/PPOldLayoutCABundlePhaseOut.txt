---++ Project plan to phase out old layout CA bundle
---+++ Problem Statement
The OSG CA certificates are currently released in two different layout/formats. The difference between these format is that the old layout has hashes that are only compatible with openssl 0.9.x, while the new layout has hashes (using symlinks) that are compatible with both openssl 0.9.x. and 1.0.x. The new layout has been in production in OSG for over an year and is the default in the RPM releases. IGTF want to stop supporting the old format and are keeping it in their release just for OSG. The OSG security team would like to phase out and stop distributing the CA release using old layout. 

---+++ Goal
   * Phase out and stop distributing the CA release using old layout. 

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand  (Lead), Mine
   * Participants: Alain (VDT), GOC

---+++ Deliverable from the project:
   * Instructions for sites to do the transition
   * Update CA release process documentation
   * Update OSG documentation 

---+++ Schedule
   * Effort: 5 FTE week, Participating Tier 3 Site admins 1FTE day/each
   * Project start : June18, 2012
   * Project End Date: Oct 30, 2012
      * Development Phase ends: Aug 31, 2012
      * Deprecation of GOC service: Oct 30, 2012
