---++ Project plan to phase out old layout CA bundle
---+++ Problem Statement
The OSG CA certificates are currently released in two different layout/formats. The difference between these format is that the old layout has hashes that are only compatible with openssl 0.9.x, while the new layout has hashes (using symlinks) that are compatible with both openssl 0.9.x. and 1.0.x. The new layout has been in production in OSG for over an year and is the default in the RPM releases. IGTF want to stop supporting the old format and are keeping it in their release just for OSG. The OSG security team would like to phase out and stop distributing the CA release using old layout. 

---+++ Goal
   * Phase out and stop distributing the CA release using old layout. 

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand  (Lead), Mine
   * Participants: Alain (VDT), GOC

---+++ Deliverable from the project:
   * Instructions for sites to do the transition
   * Update CA release process documentation
   * Update OSG documentation 

---+++ Schedule
   * Effort: 4 FTE week
   * Project start : June18, 2012
   * Project End Date: Oct 30, 2012
      * Development Phase ends: Aug 31, 2012
      * Deprecation of GOC service: Oct 30, 2012

| *Task* | *State* | *Owner* | *Target Start* | *Target Finish* | *Actual Finish* | *Notes* |
| Identify sites that are using old layout and downloading tarballs | %NOT_STARTED% | - | - | - | We will have to look at the access logs for old layout tarballs from GOC production and ITB  repository |

| Broadly announce of Change to OSG community (specifically target sites, VOs and software contributors)  | %NOT_STARTED% | - | - | - | - |
| Develop instruction as needed to facilitate transition  | %NOT_STARTED% | - | - | - | - |
| Update the CA release process documentation on twiki  | %NOT_STARTED% | - | - | - | - |
| Update OSG documentation on twiki/software.grid.iu.edu  | %NOT_STARTED% | - | - | - | - |
| Continue release updates of CA packages in old layout  | %NOT_STARTED% | - | Oct 31, 2012 | - | - |
| Deprecate the old layout CA releases  | %NOT_STARTED% | - | Oct 31, 2012 | - | - |

---+++ Dependencies/ Risks
   * One of the big concerns is that we are switching the CA bundle layout from old to new is due to the fact that CA certificates are integral part of our security infrastructure.  We were concerned that a site which uses the old layout might have legacy software which could stop working after a switch to new layout. The new layout had no problems with vdt software stack except for the old legacy versions of VOMS servers. The new layout has been available in the software repo (and via Koji) for a while. 

---+++ Affected Parties
   * This change will affect anyone (primarily OSG resource and VO admins) using CA  packages, this is typically all S/W components that rely on our PKI infrastructure  for authentication 
   * All affected parties will be notified.
