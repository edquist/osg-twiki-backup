---++Testing of new CA distribution format on ITB

The proposed change in the CA package due to the new layout from IGTF to accommodate openssl 1.0 is slated to go into production on OSG with the next IGTF release. The changes have already been identified in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP7][SEP7]] and implemented. However since this change affects our security infrastructure significantly the security team will like to have the changes tested comprehensively on the ITB. 

In particular we want the following pieces of software/services tested/verified and signed off by ITB sites.

   1. CE 
      * gatekeeper
      * gsiftp
      * RSV probes
      * vdt-update-certs
      * vdt-ca-manage
      * fetch-crl
   2. SE (dcache/bestman)
   3. GUMS
   4. VOMS
   5. OSG client
      * globus client tools
      * srm client tools
      * Condor-G
   6. WN Client
   7. pilot jobs framework
   8. glexec

*WARNING* : It is critical for this tests that the sites use the CA package from the ITB cache, since it uses the new layout. If package from production cache is used the tests are meaningless since the production CA packages still uses the old CA package layout.
