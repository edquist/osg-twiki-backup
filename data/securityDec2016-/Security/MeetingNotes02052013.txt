---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * Fermilab PKI project will require an increase in effort. 
      * How is this going to effect OSG:
      * CILogon CA will get pushed back.
      * Pakiti presentation will be completed on time for AHM. Kevin is confident with making progress towards the goals set for publicizing the Pakiti service. 
      * CVMFS assessment will be pushed back.      
   * No important vulnerabilities. 

*Anand*
   * Condor vulnerability. 2 tickets are still open. Found more sites that are potentially vulnerable. we are able to run the test 75 machines. 5 new potentially un-patched sites. Anand will verify whether they are really vulnerable or not. we could not run the job on the remaining 23 sites. We plan to verofy the condor versions for these 23 sites. if the versions do not help us, we will contact the sites and ask them what their actions were. 
   * IGTF normal release is in ITB. next week it will be in production. 
   * Risk assessment for sha-1 and md5 proxies. using osg 3.x. grid-proxy-init (v grid-proxy-utils-5.0) with no parameters.  a sha-1 user cert created a sha-1 proxy and sha-2 user cert created a sha-2 user proxy. grid-proxy-init -old creates the same output. voms-proxy-init (v 2.0.8) with no parameters if you input a sha-2 user cert, it creates a sha-1 proxy. 
      * We can contact the voms-developers to also get an output of sha-2 proxies.
      * if there is no publicly available way to create collision. if there is a collision, then the question is how long it takes to create a collision and whether that time is longer than the lifetime of a proxy. 
      * we should also test the osg 2.X series to find out what proxies they create. 
   * glideinwms incident drill. emailed Marco but could not receive an answer. Mine will talk to Chander about which frontend we can access.       

*Mine* 
   * OSG Annual DOE and NSF Reports. 
   * Traceability requirements are finished. Now pushing this in ermilab channels to make it an official policy.
   * CVMFS review is going on for fermilab and osg
   * Accepting CIlogon Basic CA at Fermilab is put on the back burner due to other sceurity work going on at Fermilab and OSG.
