Due to time differences I ask Doug and JIm to continue as incident responders. 

2) incident closing-- is there any outstandingtickets issues?

  alternately can we submit jobs to CEs as MIS VO members?

3) DNS incident close up: Jim will finish this incident and write the final report.

Doug, Jim will carry out this process after I leave on the 15th, which is also the deadline for this process. Please ensure that you canrun each step and create tarballs in a quick turn around time, download Alain's scripts, change a few lines to run them on your environment, createa the tarballs, etc. 

Security team's testing process after we put out the tarball and pull that off from the GOC. Test with the vdt-cert-update script. Another issue for future: this script does not do any authentication pulling down the Certificates. I would like it to use SSL in future. 

5) Christoph's command line security tools

6) Frank's banning tool requirements . I will wait for Doug, Jim and Ron's comments

 7) GUMS Frederic and Karl still in the GUMS, no cms entry--Mine

8) privacy policy disclaimers -- get the text in final shape. Ron C

9) Miron, Jim and Mine will meet and talk about logging policy.

10) Tim Rupp fixed the ST&E tool and Ron has access now. Security controls can proceed-- Ron

11) Doug forwarded email about InCommon. TeraGrid joined InCommon. what about OSG? 

TeraGrid user portal uses shibboleth and inCommon for user access. what web browser based access OSG provide? 

hooking up the web interface with MyProxy would solve certs problem. SLCS cert generation can be done by Myproxy with asking user to authN with home institute. 

teraGrid portal phase 1 would not access to CE, oly portal services allocations what systems they have access to, change contact iinfo 

phase 2: get SLCS, generate proxy and run gsi-ssh within browser. 

12) documentation who is responsible ---Mine will find that out.
