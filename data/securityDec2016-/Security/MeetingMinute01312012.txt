---++ Meeting Minutes

*Kevin*

   * Finished the incident close-out report. Announcements form EGI incidents were sent.
   * Kevin joined the grid-sec. 
   * An incident checklist is incorporated into the incident process. 
   * Will install osg ce on CST machines. Due Date March 5th. 
   * how can we incorporate site admins's practices regarding the security tools. E.g. TTU installed the TripWire after the incident. It would be great if they share with other sites how it went. We can incorporate this in OSG blog. 

*Marco*

   * Mysql vulnerability is out. no patch available yet. 
   * Asked Alain to provide a new page that documents the contents of osg release 3. there is some release notes at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/ReleaseNotes but they are not easy to use and not comprehensive. Alain gave us this temporary page. http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-testing/x86_64/. Put the URL on security twiki. Helpful enough for now. It does not have the link to earlier releases. What is VDT support policy? only suport the current release. Then, we are fine with tis page. Otherwise, we would like links to earlier releases. 

   * Archive all software vulnerabilities in VDT tickets. Document them on security twiki. List the open security vulnerabilities by the end of this week. Archive all past vulnerabilities by the end of Feb.  

*Anand*
   * CA relesase process: We got the list of sites who hits GOC for CA packages. Anand contacted them individually. LBL has not responded yet. The only site. There are some EU sites who hit GOC and we have no contact info on these people's. GOC has a VOMS server. We need to check with them before finalizing the move. RPM transition work from osg security will be finsihed by the end of this week. We will start the transition plan this week. Due date is end of Feb. 
   * Incident drill. Emailed the Identified the sites. Plan is ready. Doug added a few sites to the drill. Rob Snihur has not responded yet. Will ask sites if doing the drill before the AHM is reasonable.   Kevin possibly can help with this. 
   * Emailed Brian and sought his comments on our documentation banning a user. Incorporated his comments onto our documentation. Marko can take a look at the changes.  
   * New IGTF release. GOC released and put it in ITB. Next week GOC production release. Will coordinate the release next week for Koji. will send a reminder to Basney about availability of Digicert CAs.
