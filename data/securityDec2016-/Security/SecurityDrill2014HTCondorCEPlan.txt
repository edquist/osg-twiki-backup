---+ Overview

The OSG Security Team will conduct a drill to test the ability of sites running !HTCondor-CE to identify current running and past jobs submitted by a potentially malicious user.

---+ Steps

   * Several days before the drill, the security team will submit jobs directly to the to be tested !HTCondor-CE system, as well as via a submit node that will route the job via glideinwms to the !HTCondor-CE system.
   * On the day of the test, jobs intended to run the duration of the test will again be submitted directly and via glideinwms.
   * The test site will be notified of the test malicious user, and we will ask for them to identify and if running terminate jobs from the test user.
   * The test site will report if they were successful and what artifacts were discovered about jobs run by the test malicious user.
