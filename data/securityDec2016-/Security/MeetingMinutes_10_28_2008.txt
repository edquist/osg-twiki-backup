---++ Meeting Minutes 

---+++ Policy Work
Jim worked on policy work and talked to Ruth.
This week we have Incident Response and Grid Security Policy in ET agenda. VO AUP template is also on the agenda but Mine thinks it does not need official approval because it is just a template. 

VOs which have responded to Doug's requests was DZero, EDu and OSG VOs. 
 Jim will attend future VO forums meetings to educate VOs about upcoming VO membership and registration policies

---+++ Operational issues
---++++ Twiki Hack
Rob Quick reported that twiki got hacked. Kyle was applying a hot fix last Sunday to twiki config file and had to reset the config file permissions. The attacker scanned the server and gained access as an apache user.  The attacker started a cron job that sends signals to http://elsner-park.de/ . Once the attack is discovered, the config file is turned off and permissions have been reset. Rob checked if any of the twiki files have been changed. Rob did not find any new version changes since Sunday. No root access is gained. cron job is killed. Twiki server will go through maintenance phase this week. Indiana 's own incident response team is informed. Jim will write a report on this on OSG incident page. The existing version of twiki will be wiped and new version will be installed this week. 

---++++ Gratia reporting problems 
LIGO claims the numbers in their weekly numbers are incorrect. Philippe and Mine figured it is because Mine does not parse all of the job submissions. This will be corrected. 
NanoHub claims invigo service 00 and 09 have wrong numbers in gratia. GOC opened tickets for both. GOC contacted site admins which does not run 09  services. for invigo 00, it reports jobs from nwicg_notre_dame while it does not indeed submit any jobs through gram. 
goc will contact gratia team if there is a reporting problem. 

---+++ Software tools 

---++++ RSV probes
Anand will write a report on central RSV probes that checks CA and CRLs directly from CA distribution web sites. Jim and Anand are also sent the new RSV plan that explains how site's probes will be run to check ca and crl expiry dates. 
Arvind and Rob says RSV probes should not be dependent on VDT. for central probes , it is OK to be VDT-dependent. 

Anand 's code on Ca mgmt is finished and Scott is reviewing the code. Jim has viewed the demo. Anand will update the twiki timelines.
