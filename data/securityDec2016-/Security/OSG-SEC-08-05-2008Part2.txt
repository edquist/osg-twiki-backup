---+++ Actions to take

1) Our first action is to contact USAtlas and Atlas security officers and obtain a report (see above email from Dantong Yu)

2) Receive confirmation from EGEE to re-distribute the announcement (has already obtained as of 08-05 17:00 )

3) receive ET approval over OSG announcement

obtained 08-05-2008 around 6 pm

4) send announcement to OSG sites and ask them to watch malicious IP addresses and the above user certificate. Sites should be able to automatically update their GUMS server

they should report any suspicious activity in this user's account and from above IP addresses.

two announcements sent out on 08-06-2008

5) We can possibly check whether sites have updated from Atlas VOMS server. This is optional and not necessary.

---+++ Incident Log (continued)

08-07-2008 9am: Ian stokes Rees responded to our email saying that none of the OSG resources under his control at Harvard has been affected

08-07-2008 we did gratia queries over Karl and Frederic's certificates across all OSG reporting sites.

the query used for these searches is:

select * from VOProbeSummary where CommonName like "%karl harrison%"

We found a single record for Karl
|  *#* | |  *EndTime* | |  *VOName* | |  *ProbeName* | |  *CommonName* | |  *ResourceType* | |  *Njobs* | |  *WallDuration* | |  *CpuUserDuration* | |  *CpuSystemDuration* |
|  1 | |  2007-09-22 00:00:00.0 | |  lhcb | |  condor:osgce.hepgrid.uerj.br | |  karl harrison | |  Batch | |  1 | |  1,149 | | 0 | | 0 |
| *Number of records = 1*  |||||||||||||||||||

Apparently job has ended long before

and we could not find any job record from Frederic

08-07-2008 5:30 pm: emailed John Huth at harvard to confirm usatlas at harvard is secure

08-08-2008 11:00 am Have not heard from John Huth. Emailed Suvendra Nath Dutta and John Brunelle : both aregris security contacts.

Immediate response from them received. Suvendra does not see any malicious IPs in its network logs.

The 216.186.49.132 address appears to be a washington address:

The 131.142.42.17 is in fact a Harvard address at the Center for astrophysics. Steve Beikman [[mailto:sjb@head.cfa.harvard.edu][]] informs us:

"131.142.42.17 was taken off line two weeks ago. On the morning of Friday, July 25, around 10:30am, it's network disabled. We've been investigating this since. US and German CERT are involved, along with several .edu and research sites."
