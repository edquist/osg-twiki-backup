---++General Topics

---+++I heard !DigiCert CA is a commercial CA. Does this transition mean that my local site will pay for certificates?

No, OSG's contract with !DigiCert will allow certificates to be issued to OSG participants at no additional cost.

---+++Wasn't !DigiCert recently compromised?

No. The CA that was compromised was !Digicert Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian company which has no relationship with the U.S. company !DigiCert based in Utah. Quoting from the [[http://www.entrust.net/advisories/malaysia.htm][Entrust advisory]]:

<blockquote>Digicert Sdn. Bhd. (Digicert Malaysia) is a certificate authority based in Malaysia. There is no relationship to !DigiCert Inc. based in Utah, US.</blockquote>

---+++Will DOEGrids CA stop operations soon? What will happen to my certificate from DOEgrids CA if they disappear?

DOEGrids CA will not cease operations abruptly. OSG and ESNet managements are working closely to develop a transition plan. The transition plan covers all the steps to ensure that OSG users are  unaffected by the change. The complete transition will take at least a year for integrating !DigiCert CA into OSG infrastructure and another year for ramping down DOEGrids CA operations. Both OSG and ESNet will provide periodic updates to user community about their progress. 

OSG users will continue to use their DOEGrids certificates as usual during the transition period. We will not revoke any DOEgrids CA certificates until we ensure that OSG users have obtained new certificates from !DigiCert CA. 


---+++What does this transition mean for the end user? What does the end user need to do to get new certificates?

End users are not required to take any action for now. Once the initial integration with !DigiCert complete, OSG and ESNet managements will send updates to the user community with the specific instructions. We will make sure that there is sufficient overlap between the end of !DOEGrids CA operation and !DigiCert CA integration. End users will not have any time period where they will have no access to any certificates. 


---+++I am a !GridAdmin/RA Agent for DOEGrids CA. Will I have the same privileges with !DigiCert CA? If so, will you require anything from my home institution?

Yes, !DigiCert CA has a very similar infrastructure to DOEGrids CA. You will continue to act as a !GridAdmin with !DigiCert CA. 
Your home institution is not required to do anything for you to obtain this privilege with !DigiCert. 

---+++Will the new OSG/DigiCert certificates be trusted by browsers so we don't get all sorts of warnings popping up?

No. During the Pilot, it was decided it made sense to separate OSG's need for Grid certificates from OSG's need for web server certificates. This will make the process of getting Grid certificates for users much simpler. Hence OSG Grid certificates will be obtained from the !DigiCert Grid CA (http://www.digicert-grid.com/) and not their normal commercial CA.

For web server certificates, we recommend using the [[http://www.incommon.org/cert/][InCommon Certificate Service]] or one of the many commericial CAs that offer such certificates.

---+++Where do I get the new OSG/DigiCert CA certificates?

The CA certificate is part of the IGTF bundle:
http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/accredited/igtf-preinstalled-bundle-classic.tar.gz

You can get the CA certificates directly from: http://www.digicert-grid.com/

---++Command-line Clients

---+++I'm getting the following error requesting a host certificate "problems making Certificate Request 30602:error:0D07A097:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_mbstring_ncopy:string too long:a_mbstr.c:154:maxsize=64"

Unfortunately the underlying OpenSSL software enforces a 64 character limit on the length of the Common Name field and there is no work around at this time. Please see [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-252][OSGPKI-252]] for details and contact OSG Operations if this is a problem for you.
