---+++ List of affected parties

List of possible affected common Xsede/OSG users:

<verbatim>
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Stefan Meinel/CN=UID:smeinel" fermilab
smeinel,Stefan Meinel,smeinel@mit.edu
responded that he did not have any certs stored on tacc systems.

"/C=DE/O=GermanGrid/OU=AEI/CN=Philipp Moesta" ligo
tg803568,Philipp Moesta,philipp.moesta@aei.mpg.de
Email bounced back. Does not appear to have digicert cert.

"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Wei Xie 61860" uscms01
wweixie,Wei Xie,wxie4@wisc.edu
Did not have OSG certs on the system

"/DC=ch/DC=cern/OU=Organic Units/OU=Users/CN=qili/CN=730168/CN=Qiang Li" uscms01
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Qiang Li/CN=UID:qliphy" fermilab
qiangli,Qiang Li,liqiang@ou.edu
Neither the Fermilab nor the two cern Qiang Li entries seem to have OU emails, so I think this is a different person. Does not seem to be a Qiang Li with a Digicert cert.

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

---++ Incident Log

Additional account names received 10/22, no exact matches found. -- Main.KevinHill - 23 Oct 2013

Jim from Xsede reported another account was found compromised. TACC is taking the stampede system offline pending further investigation. Another list of possibly compromised users will probably be coming. -- Main.KevinHill - 24 Oct 2013

---++ Summary

   * *Final Report*: [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/][OSG !DocDB Document ###]]

No new compromised accounts have been discovered for over a week. Xsede believes they have discovered the root kit used to gain root access, as well as the account that was originally compromised and led to the incident.

No OSG systems, credentials or accounts were compromised. System did not have very latest kernel updates installed due to need for some custom kernel modules. This serves as a reminder to stay up to date with kernel patches.
