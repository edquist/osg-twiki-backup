---++ Domains Registered with the OSG PKI


Domains appearing in host certificates must be registered with the OSG PKI and !DigiCert. This page lists the registered domains so that staff without access to !DigiCert can check to see if a domain is registered. See the bottom of this page for information on requesting 

To request a domain be added, [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][Submit a ticket]] asking the OSG PKI staff to add one or more domains.

*Note:* This list is not authoritative, it is manually maintained. !DigiCert maintains the authoritative list in [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php][MPKI]] (only accessible to authorized staff). Eventually, once [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-9][DigiCert provides an API]] OIM will provide this list.

*Note:* Currently this list of domains also applies to user's email addresses. This will be fixed and no longer in early October. Please see [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-7][OSGPKI-7]] for details.
