---++ Domains Registered with the OSG PKI


Domains appearing in host certificates must be registered with the OSG PKI and !DigiCert. This page lists the registered domains so that staff without access to !DigiCert can check to see if a domain is registered. See the bottom of this page for information on requesting 

To request a domain be added, [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][Submit a ticket]] asking the OSG PKI staff to add one or more domains. (If you are OSG PKI staff, please see the bottom of this page for directions.)

*Note:* This list is not authoritative, it is manually maintained. !DigiCert maintains the authoritative list in [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php][MPKI]] (only accessible to authorized staff). Eventually, once [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-9][DigiCert provides an API]] OIM will provide this list.

*Note:* Currently this list of domains also applies to user's email addresses. This will be fixed and no longer in early October. Please see [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-7][OSGPKI-7]] for details.

---++ To add a domain

*NOTE*: The process below is currently not working. Please contact [[mailto:vwelch@indiana.edu][Von Welch]] to add a domain. ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-171][Issue]]).

*NOTE:* OSG has both a test account (for OIM-ITB) and production account (for OIM) at DigiCert. The domain list is separate for the two accounts. In general, you want to add new domains to both accounts to keep them in sync. The directions are the same for both accounts, you will just log in with a different username and password for each account.

Authorized OSG staff with access to !DigiCert's MPKI may add domains.
