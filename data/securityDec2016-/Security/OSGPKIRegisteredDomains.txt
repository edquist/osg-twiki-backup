---++ Domains Registered with the OSG PKI


Domains appearing in host certificates must be registered with the OSG PKI and !DigiCert. This page lists the registered domains so that staff without access to !DigiCert can check to see if a domain is registered. See the bottom of this page for information on requesting 

To request a domain be added, [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][Submit a ticket]] asking the OSG PKI staff to add one or more domains. (If you are OSG PKI staff, please see the bottom of this page for directions.)

*Note:* This list is not authoritative, it is manually maintained. !DigiCert maintains the authoritative list in [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php][MPKI]] (only accessible to authorized staff). Eventually, once [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-9][DigiCert provides an API]] OIM will provide this list.

---++ To add a domain

*NOTE:* OSG has both a test account (for OIM-ITB) and production account (for OIM) at DigiCert. The domain list is separate for the two accounts. In general, you want to add new domains to both accounts to keep them in sync. The directions are the same for both accounts, you will just log in with a different username and password for each account.

Authorized OSG staff with access to !DigiCert's MPKI may add domains.
   1 Visit https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php
   1 This displayed page lists the domains registered with !DigiCert. To request the addition of a domain, select "Add Domain"
   1 Enter one of more domains in the pop-up window.
      1 The second field should default to "OSG Pilot" or "OSG Production" - you do not need to change it.
      1 Leave the "Enable EV" checkbox unchecked.
   1 Select "Add"
   1 !DigiCert will approve the domain, which typically takes 1-2 business days.
      1 They will send an email to the OSG administrator (see [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-159][OSGPKI-159]]).
   1 Add the domain to the list on this page.

Note that domains should be Validated for "Grid" - if a domain doesn't have Grid listed in its validations, please contact !DigiCert to correct. If a domain is not so validated, the following error will results from host certificate requests in that domain: "You are unable to approve this request, as all the domains have not been validated yet." ([[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/12990][for example]]) (Having other validations doesn't seem to hurt.)
