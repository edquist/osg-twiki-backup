---++ Domains Registered with the OSG PKI

Domains appearing in host certificates must be registered with the OSG PKI and !DigiCert. This page lists the registered domains so that staff without access to !DigiCert can check to see if a domain is registered.

*Note:* This list is not authoritative, it is manually maintained. !DigiCert maintains the authoritative list in [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php][MPKI]] (only accessible to authorized staff).

*Note:* Currently this list of domains also applies to user's email addresses. This will be fixed in the future. Please see [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-7][OSGPKI-7]] for details. When [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-9][DigiCert provides an API]] OIM will provide this list.
