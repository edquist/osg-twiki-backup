   * Vulnerability reported in Linux kernel: A 'use after free' vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow a local root exploit and potentially also remote arbitrary code execution. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31838
   * OpenSSL published new release that fixes some vulnerabilities; one rated as High: TLS connections using a specific set of ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
      * This does NOT affect Red Hat systems
      * No current Linux distributions include OpenSSL 1.1.0 yet, so only systems with custom/manual installations of OpenSSL 1.1.0 are impacted.
