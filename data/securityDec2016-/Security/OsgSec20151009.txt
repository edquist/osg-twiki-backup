---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: High  
   * *Urgency*: Immediate 

Possibly, due to a weak password, an intruder obtained the root password, and got access to some nodes. The intruder implanted a SSH backdoor and record multiple SSH passwords. All the possible affected accounts are blocked. Also, the intruder installed a software package for digital currency mining. Due to this attack, some CPU power was lost, but there was not impact on grid resources since the machines were not in the same network with grid nodes.
