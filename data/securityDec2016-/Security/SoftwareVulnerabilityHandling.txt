---+ OSG Software Vulnerability Handling

_DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT_

Goal: Define a software vulnerability handling process separate from the [[IncidentResponseProcess][incident response process]].

A software vulnerability is a weakness that allows an attacker to violate the integrity of the system.
The VDT team is primarily responsible for software vulnerability handling in OSG.

---++ Process Checklist
   1 *Initial Report*
      * The software vulnerability handling process begins when the VDT team receives a vulnerability report to vdt-security@cs.wisc.edu. If a vulnerability is reported elsewhere, it should be forwarded to vdt-security@cs.wisc.edu to begin the vulnerability handling process. Messages to vdt-security@cs.wisc.edu result in a private ticket being opened in the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/support/tickets/][VDT Ticket System]].
      * VDT and OSG security team members actively monitor mailing lists and other venues for announcements and discussions of security vulnerabilities that may impact the VDT. When they discover vulnerabilities, they post them to vdt-security@cs.wisc.edu to begin the vulnerability handling process.
   1 *Triage*
      1 The VDT team performs triage on incoming reports to determine if vulnerability handling is required.
         * Is the message a software vulnerability report? If not, it is handled like a regular VDT ticket by the VDT team.
         * Is the vulnerability in VDT software (i.e., software included in a currently-supported VDT distribution)? If not, it is out of scope and should be forwarded (as appropriate) and the ticket should be closed.
      1 For valid reports, a VDT team member promptly sends an acknowledgement to the reporter.
      1 The VDT team member initially handling the ticket promptly assigns a ticket owner, who is responsible for leading the vulnerability handling process.
   1 *Analysis*
      1 The ticket owner performs a risk assessment in consultation with the OSG security team, the OSG executive team, and the relevant software providers. Severity categories are defined below.
      1 The ticket owner sets a target date for releasing a fix and an advisory, again in consultation with others.
   1 *Disclosure*
      1 The ticket owner issues a public advisory.
         * The advisory should properly credit the reporter. Always check with the reporter to see how he or she would prefer to be credited (if at all).
         * The advisory may be released at the same time as a new VDT software update that resolves the issue.
         * The advisory may recommend a work-around while a VDT software update is in preparation.
         * The advisory may recommend that a VDT software component stop being used until a fix is available.
         * When feasible, the timing of the advisory release should be coordinated with the software provider and other grid vulnerability handling teams ([[http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/gsvg/][GSVG]], [[http://dev.globus.org/wiki/SecurityCommittee/Security_Vulnerability_Handling][Globus]])
         * The OSG security team may recommend that OSG sites and/or VOs take action in response to the advisory, but this is a separate action from the release of the public advisory by VDT to all VDT users.
   1 *Software Update*
      1 The ticket owner works with the software provider to obtain a fix for the issue.
      1 The VDT team performs internal testing and validation of the fix.
      1 The fix may be tested in the [[Integration.WebHome][ITB]] before inclusion in an official VDT release.
      1 The VDT team issues a new VDT release with the fix together with an (updated) advisory.
   1 *Closure*
      1 The ticket owner closes the ticket when the software update(s) and public advisories are released.

---++ Issue Classification
| *Level* | *Description* | *Response* |
| Critical | This rating is given to flaws that are likely to result in major, grid-wide security incidents. | Target Date: 2 business days<br/>Response is coordinated with the OSG Security Team. Prompt advisories and patches are needed to avoid the spread of an attack.|
| High | This rating is given to flaws that allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to gain privileges or allow authenticated users to elevate privileges. | Target Date: 3 weeks<br/>|
| Moderate | This rating is given to flaws with potentially serious consequences but where exploit is unlikely, because they are difficult to exploit or require uncommon configurations or are easily traceable to misbehaving, authenticated users. | Target Date: 3 months<br/>Fixes for these issues will likely go through ITB testing and be included with other fixes in periodic VDT updates.|
| Low | This rating is given to flaws where impact is considered minimal. | Target Date: 6 months<br/>Fixes for these issues may be scheduled for major VDT updates.|

---++ Open Issues
   * How are vulnerabilities reported? Via email to vdt-security@cs.wisc.edu?
   * How are vulnerabilities tracked? 
      * Use the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/support/tickets/][VDT Ticketing System]]?
      * Use the [[https://tick.globalnoc.iu.edu/MRcgi/MRentrancePage.pl][GOC Ticketing System]]?
   * We need a risk assessment methodology.
      * [[http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html][Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)]]
      * Should our risk assessment be internal or public? Currently VDT advisories do not include a risk classification.
   * We need a disclosure policy/procedure.
      * When to issue a VDT security advisory?
      * When to issue an OSG security advisory?
      * When to send advisories to security contacts? peer grids?
      * When to issue public advisory?
   * How does OSG security operations respond to a vulnerability impacting OSG sites?
      * This is a separate issue from how to address software vulnerabilities in VDT in general.
      * The VDT Team is responsible for software vulnerabilities in VDT that can impact both OSG sites and other grid sites.
      * The OSG Security Team is responsible for taking action if OSG sites should disable services, upgrade software, change configurations, etc., in response to a vulnerability in VDT. This should only be required for critical issues.
   * Do we every issue advisories for software not in the VDT (i.e., commonly-used system software, Linux kernel, etc.)?
      * Likely the answer is no, and we should be explicit about this.
      * Is there any OSG software outside of VDT?
   * What are the metrics associated with this activity? Who tracks them?
      * Should the closure process include a report to the EB? A submission to [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]]?
   * What OSG area does this fall under? Software Tools? Security? Software/VDT?
   * Who is in charge? 
      * Alain has overall responsibility as Software Coordinator?
      * Mine is responsibility for risk assessment as Security Officer?
   * Does VDT already have an advisory template?
   * What do we expect from VDT contributors regarding software vulnerabilities? We should document it.
      * When/How should they inform us?
      * How should they respond to issues reported to us that impact their software?
      * Mine expects them to "perform routine checks" of their software for vulnerabilities. Have we communicated this expectation to them? How do we confirm it?
