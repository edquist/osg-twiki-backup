---Meeting Minutes 6/30

Attendees: Mine and Anand 

   * About the ST&E: No major problems. Many people responded to the controls. People who have not responded promised a response date of July4th week. We keep the list of responses on twiki. Anand will start evaluating the collected answers and writing security recommendations as soon as possible. Anand will be gone to the TeraGrid between18 -22 of July. But he will continue working on evaluating the reports. When Mine comes back from vacation, we will work on completing our report for the osg staff retreat. Mine will also work on preparing the osg wbs planning to be presented at staff retreat

   * Testing the changes in doegrids cert. The changes had been released into ITB for two weeks and have been tested at least for a week. No problems have been reported so far. This is IGTF version 1.38 old format + new DOEGrid CA cert. Anand will go to the ITB meeting on 6/30/2011 to get test results.
 
   * Cert migration (New hashes). 4 new caches has been installed into the ITB. In OSG release 1.2.0 Anand will release the IGTF 40 (new layout) into the ITB caches. This will happen on July 5th. There are some changes needed to the software, that would be released to ITB on July 17th. See below. 

   * RSV CA probe needs to be fixed. It should distinguish and compare which hash a site uses. A site that uses the old layout should not be expected to have the have the new md5sums for the ca files. remember that there are 2 md5sums for each version of the ca files. Even though md5sums are the same for each version of the ca file, we list the needed md5sums on a file kept at GOC separately. The file at GOC used by RSV probe has contents such as this: hash1.ca1 md5sum1; hash2.ca2 md5sum1. Anand will update the probe and release it next week to ITB. 
   * Anand also noticed that there is a slight content difference between the md5sums of the files contained in new distribution as opposed to old distribution. 

   * Anand will also ask Steve Timm if he will want to go ahead with releasing fetch-crl v3 into ITB. We may try to include this in ITB release on 17th if Alain also agrees. However, this is not urgent because older version of fetch-crl also works with old and new hashes.  

   * There were no vulnerabilities and/or incidents.
