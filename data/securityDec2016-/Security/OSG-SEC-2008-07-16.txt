---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: Medium: immediate exploit is unlikely, risk to core services is limited 
   * *Urgency*: Medium: IRT members will multitask response with other important tasks. 

_Add additional analytical details about the incident here, including an assessment of the risk, what assets are affected, etc._

---++ Mitigation Plan

_Document how this incident will be addressed._

---+++ Actions to take

   1 For each core OSG service, contact the DNS administrator and verify that patches have been applied. 
   1 Send a notice to VO security contacts asking them to verify with their DNS administrators so VOMS servers are not impacted. 
   1 Send a notice to site security contacts informing them of the issue and our response. 

---+++ How to monitor progress
| *DNS server* | *status* |
| opensciencegrid.org | |
| vdt.cs.wisc.edu (software and CA certificates) | cs.wisc.edu DNS servers have been upgraded |
| physics.bu.edu (Pacman distribution site) | |
| software.grid.iu.edu (OSG pacman cache) | |

---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

_Based on the risk assessment above, what response time is necessary and achievable?_

---+++ List of affected parties

_This list determines who we need to communicate with, who needs to take action, etc. However, be careful about handling sensitive information._

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

_What is the condition under which we can declare this incident to be resolved?_

---++ Incident Log

07/08/2008: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113 published

07/16/2008: Report by Alain Roy. OSG incident response process initiated.

Alain Roy reports the cs.wisc.edu DNS servers have been upgraded. -- Main.JimBasney - 17 Jul 2008

---++ Summary

   * *Final Report*: [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/][OSG !DocDB Document ###]] 

_What was the resolution of the incident?_

_What is the long-term mitigation plan (including changes in our operations, middleware or anything else that enabled the event) and timeline?_

Long-term:
   * Address GUMS not checking host certificates and thus being vulnerable to DNS attacks 
   * Address vdt-update-certs relying on DNS to obtain the set of root CAs to install 
   * Sign VDT software distributions? 

_Deposit the final incident report in !DocDB and fill in the !DocDB URL and document number above._
