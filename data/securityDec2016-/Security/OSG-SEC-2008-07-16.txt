---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: Medium: immediate exploit is unlikely, risk to core services is limited 
   * *Urgency*: Medium: IRT members will multitask response with other important tasks. 

_Add additional analytical details about the incident here, including an assessment of the risk, what assets are affected, etc._

---++ Mitigation Plan

We plan to follow the actions summarized below. We created security tickets in footprints system to keep track of our core services. We determine that the VDT caches, pacman caches and the osg distribution at Indiana university is important for OSG operations and they may be even more vulnerable to an attack. Because we do not provide software with hashes or through secure web sites, an end user can be lured into downloading malicious code from an attacking site. For this reason, we asked these services tosend us confirmation regarding their statuses. In addition, the VOMS servers can become a vulnerability. An attacker can access a site by poointing to a malicious VOMS server instead of a legitimate VOMS server. However, this attack is less likely to happen because it requires detailed knowledge over the grid infrastructure.

Nevertheless, we asked OSG VOs to check their DNS servers and apply the patches.

The remaining core OSG services are obviously important for our operations. We urged them to contact their local site admins and apply the necessary patches.

---+++ Actions to take

   1 %ICON{wip}% For each core OSG service, contact the DNS administrator and verify that patches have been applied. 
   1 %ICON{done}% Send a notice to VO security contacts asking them to verify with their DNS administrators so VOMS servers are not impacted. 
   1 %ICON{done}% Send a notice to site security contacts informing them of the issue and our response.

---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

The risk is determined to be medium. We expect core services to notify their local site admins (where the core service runs) as soon as possible within business hours. Because the upgrades are provided by vendors, the complete mitigation is dependent on vendor-and local site' schedules.

---+++ List of affected parties

This is a well-advertised vulnerability. Thus, all our partner grids must be up-to-date. In fact, TeraGrid, EGEE are awar of the issue. Although vulnerability is not OSG specific, we can send a courtesy email to our partners at peer-grids-csirt email list. However, this is not mandatory.
---+++ Definition of End Of Event

All footprint tickets are closed, meaning all of the core OSG services have been upgraded.

---++ Incident Log

07/08/2008: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/800113 published

07/16/2008: Report by Alain Roy. OSG incident response process initiated. Announcements to site and VO security contacts sent. Announcement to osg-peergrid-csirt-l sent.

07/17/2008: Alain Roy reports the cs.wisc.edu DNS servers have been upgraded.

07/24/2008: US-CERT announces that exploit code is publicly available: http://www.us-cert.gov/current/#dns_cache_poisoning_public_exploit

07/25/2008 All ticket statuses are entered into the website.

07/25/2008 We heard back from almost all of the OSG VOs and core services. The open tickets are for the RSV at UNL, Fermilab hosted services and pacman distribution at BU. In addition, Fermilab hosts a large number of services and they are currently waiting to hear from their vendor to receive the patch. Once we hear back from these core services, we will consider this issue to be closed.

We have not heard back form pacman site at BU. the ticket is still standing.

07/31/2008 Brian Bockelman at UNL confirms their DNS servers have been patched (ticket #5243).

08/11/2008 Saul Youssef confirms the BU DNS servers have been patched (ticket #5247).

08/19/2008 FNAL is patched (ticket #5242). This issue is resolved.

---++ Summary

   * *Final Report*: [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=778][OSG !DocDB Document #778]] 

Long-term:
   * Address GUMS not checking host certificates and thus being vulnerable to DNS attacks 
   * Address vdt-update-certs relying on DNS to obtain the set of root CAs to install 
   * Sign VDT software distributions
