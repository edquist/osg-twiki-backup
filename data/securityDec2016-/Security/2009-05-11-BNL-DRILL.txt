07) Incoming IP for both jobs was 141.142.234.178 (osg-test-ce.ncsa.uiuc.edu).                                
                                                                                                              
09) Unfortunately, we removed the jobs too aggressively and the globus directories were 
automatically deleted before we could retrieve the binaries.

Good thing is, for the condor job, the initial dir and binaries are    
found, we will investigate them.
