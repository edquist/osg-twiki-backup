   * There is a new CA release. We will release the new bundle towards the end of this week so that ITB can start testing next week. 
   * Will update the project plan on streamlining CA release process (aka CA rpm location change) before tomorrow. Will document which sites are found to be using the old location and our communication with these sites. 
   * Pakiti service transition to GOC. Reply to Scott and Robs questions on how much effort is involved with operating the Pakiti. Before the end of this week. 
   * Start a new project plan on how to phase out the old layout CA bundles from production. This will start next week and have the highest priority as the above items are finished.
