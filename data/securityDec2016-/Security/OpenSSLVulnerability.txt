---+++ Certificate replacement

We are prioritizing certificate replacements like this.

1. Web servers available to the public internet on the standard port
443, please revoke your cert and request a new one. This has the
highest likelihood of being captured.

2. Publicly available servers/services on non-standard ports. IE web
servers on port 8443, CE Gateways, GridFTP servers, etc. These are
less likely to have been scanned, but still may have been compromised.
Please get new certs as soon as can reasonably be scheduled.

3. Systems restricted to private/site-wide networks. These would
generally only have been compromised by other locally compromised
systems, so it will be up to the site admins discretion whether to
replace the certs.

4. Systems with host certs that don't accept incoming connections, ie
worker nodes with host certs. These systems certs are probably safe,
but can be replaced to be certain if desired.
