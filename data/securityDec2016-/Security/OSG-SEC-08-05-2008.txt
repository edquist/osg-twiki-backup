---+ OSG-SEC-2008-08-05-2008

There is a widespread incident involving HEP sites where attackers gained access using stolen ssh keys and local kernel exploits to gain root access. Rootkits were installed and ssh keys have been systematically stolen and used to compromise further sites. Some sites report only account compromised (no root escalation) and some other have simply detected unsuccessful ssh scans.

No OSG site has been reported to be infected or compromised, but some OSG sites are suspected compromised, and investigation is ongoing.

All sites should check their status and actively search for:
   * Connections attempts from the suspicious IP addresses 
   * Traces of suspicious SSH keys, files and malware described in the update 

We have found two user accounts compromised on non-OSG sites. The users are members of Atlas and they have been suspended from Atlas temporarily.

---++ Attack Vector
 The attackers have been stealing SSH keys to compromise more accounts and machines. If the attacker got root access all keys which are not protected by a password or by other special measures should be regarded as compromised.

The keys might easily be used to attack further hosts and should be disabled at your site and everywhere else, too.

Please send any malicious SSH keys or their fingerprints (ssh-keygen -l -f <keyfile>) that you may have discovered to both [[mailto:project-egee-osct@cern.ch][project-egee-osct@cern.ch]] and [[mailto:cert@dfn-cert.de][cert@dfn-cert.de]].

It appears the same rootkit has been used at different sites: http://packetstormsecurity.nl/UNIX/penetration/rootkits/phalanx-b6.tar.bz2

Different versions of this rootkit have been discovered. It uses /dev/mem to manipulate the kernel and modify the hooks for some system calls. /dev/shm is used for staging, storing some of the file. The same directory is used by the python script.

The DFN-CERT tested the rootkit concerning the backdoor. A simple nmap scanning does not reveal anything. An infected system does also not start communication of its own - at least not with the version tested. There were quite special communication patterns seen regarding the U Calgary IP address which might be the information needed to start the backdoor. This might be similar to the mechanism of the suckit rootkit.

Artifacts found on the compromised hosts:

   * .p2rc some sort of config file setting aliases for copying stuff by ssh and with ssh-keys provided 
   * .phalanx2 loader of the rootkit and probably backdoor 
   * .sniff sniffer log 
   * sshgrab.py python script for collecting ~/.ssh dirs and shell histories of all users if readable 

---+++ Rootkit detecting script
 This tool is kindly provided by Jens-Soenke Voeckler at ISI.EDU

It (file crk.gz) is available at:

https://osct.web.cern.ch/osct/4adef051e1fa64603e0d3646110a194c/

Adding checks for link counts in a small set of directories, and adding checks for well-known locations. The script still does NOT need to be run as root. Perl version requirement to 5.005. Unfortunately, the link count checks don't work on MacOS X Effectively.

Please note: there is no any guarantee whatsoever, use it at your own risk!

---++ Status

   * *Status*: _OPEN_ 
   * *Lead*: Doug Olson (replacing Mine who is on vacation) 
   * *Responders*: Mine, Jim, Doug 
   * *References*: CERNCERT-20080805, DFN-CERT#38506, [JANET_CSIRT #323555], [JANET_CSIRT #323557], [JANET_CSIRT #323559], [JANET_CSIRT #323561], [JANET_CSIRT #323563] 

_Optionally include additional status information here._

---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: _Medium (see IncidentResponseProcess):_ If the user's certificate is proven to be compromised and ssh attacks continue to target grid sites, the severity should be elevated to high. Currently, we have no reason to believe a grid epidemic is on its way. 
   * *Urgency*: _Medium (see IncidentResponseProcess): site admins can multi-task their responses with other tasks. Because suspicious certificate have been removed from Atlas VO, the site admins do not need to do take any additional action. The site GUMS or gridmap files should already be set to automatically synchronize with the Atlas VOMS._ <em>The severity and urgency will be elevated to high if grid sites are continued to be attacked. We will ask site admins to watch for any suspicious connections from malicious IP addresses. <br /></em> 
---++ Mitigation Plan

---+++ Actions to take

1) Our first action is to contact USAtlas and Atlas security officers and obtain a report (see above email from Dantong Yu)

2) Receive confirmation from EGEE to re-distribute the announcement (has already obtained as of 08-05 17:00 )

3) receive ET approval over OSG announcement (obtained 08-05-2008 around 6 pm)

4) send announcement to OSG sites and ask them to watch malicious IP addresses and the above user certificate. Sites should be able to automatically update their GUMS server

they should report any suspicious activity in this user's account and from above IP addresses.

two announcements sent out on 08-06-2008

5) We can possibly check whether sites have updated from Atlas VOMS server. This is optional and not necessary.

---+++ How to monitor progress

We can use Gratia checks to see whether any jobs have been submitted with Karl Harrison's certificate.

We can also check if all sites have updated their GUMS server. We can send a notification. This is optional.
---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

Because site admins do not need to take any manual action except checking their log files and ensuring ssh keys are protected, we do not expect any response from them.

The GUMS updates should occur automatically by default every 7 hours.

---+++ List of affected parties

All OSG sites who accepted Atlas users are affected. We believe that previous incidents at U Chicago and German Grid did not affect the OSG. We are informed that no user certificates have been compromised in both incidents.

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

When all OSG sites updates their GUMS servers and do not report any suspicious activity

---++ Incident Log
---+++ Communication with Atlas 08-05-2008

We contacted USAtlas and Atlas security officers and received the following report from Dantong Yu:

Please make announcement to the OSG site. I checked various system in BNL, and did not discover any suspicious activities from this particular user. I asked Jay to suspend this user from the ATLAS VOMS server. Alessandro agreed to remove this user from Atlas VOMS.

Here is what we found: <br /> <br /> 1) This user has a local account, but he has no activities in past few years. His logon shell is /bin/tcshnologin. Our system admin is pretty sure that BNL is not affected by this user. <br /> <br /> 2) We checked that our OSG gatekeeper logs. We did not see any job submitted by this user. <br /> <br /> 3) GUMS shows that this user was mapped to usatlas4 account. <br /> <br /> 4) The ATLAS analysis framework shows that this user submitted a job on 2006-04-12 10:15:58. We removed this user from ATLAS database to prevent him from submitting jobs.

---+++ The Sites Affected so far(including non-OSG sites)

The D-Grid, U Chicago and CERN incident have been reported on 08-05-2008. The remaining sites are reported on 08-06-2008.

1) First attack has affected the German Grid and been reported to EGEE. German Grid has some sites registered in EGEE and it is a national grid. The earliest report dates back to 8/4/2008 by an email from EGEE. NONE of these sites are registered with OSG.

The attacks on the German hosts seem to have come from:<br /><br />- - 208.42.23.94 - 2008-07-28 01:52:53 GMT+02<br />- - 216.186.49.132 - 2008-07-26 17:02:12 GMT+02<br />- - 75.60.89.233 - 2008-07-26 23:16:40 GMT+02<br /><br />We assume that the stolen ssh keys were transfered to:<br /><br />- - 136.159.55.31 - 2008-07-28 02:16:14 GMT+02<br /><br />RAL observed additional suspicious connection attempts from:<br /><br />- - 189.6.137.174 - 2008-07-14 10:37:44 GMT+02<br />- - 190.81.35.90 - 2008-07-14 14:08:59 GMT+02

FZ Juelich - Breakin 2008-07-28 00:34:13 GMT+02 from 216.186.49.132

Universitaet Wuppertal - Breakin 2008-07-26 17:02:12 GMT+02 via account "petrov"

Jul 26 17:02:12 jpsi sshd[9535]: Accepted publickey for petrov from 216.186.49.132 port 3664 ssh2

Break in via frontend of a small cluster of the theortical physics department. There is no grid middleware. ssh keys were stolen and from there workstations were compromised and more ssh keys stolen. The cluster in Wuppertal was not part of D-Grid.

DESY - Attempts maybe from 131.142.42.17 (2008-07-25 15:08:31 GMT+02) and 216.186.49.132 (2008-07-25 20:07:00 GMT+02) - it's not yet clear if this was legitimate (but we doubt it). No breakin.

The IP addresses include:
   * 134.94.104.3 
   * 134.94.74.11 
   * 134.94.74.111

2) Another very similar attack has been detected at U of Chicago and has been posted at http://hep.uchicago.edu/admin/report_072808.html

U Chicago confirmed that NO OSG resources at U of Chicago have been affected and therefore there is no OSG incident. <br />Attack probably from bonner-pcs2.rice.edu - 168.7.16.22<br /><br />Hosts involved:

5) CERN confirmed short but successful SSH connections from one of the malicious IP addresses below and is currently actively investigating the affected hosts. (NOT OSG)<br /><br />Jul 25 19:45:40 lxplus011 sshd[14080]: Accepted publickey for karl from<br />216.186.49.132 port 3399 ssh2<br />Jul 25 19:46:09 lxplus239 sshd[19137]: Accepted publickey for karl from<br />216.186.49.132 port 4322 ssh2<br /><br />Karl Harrison's account is believed to be compromised and has been blocked at CERN. Karl submitted a small number of<br />grid jobs, which are currently being investigated.<br /><br />More successful SSH connections have been detected between Jul 25<br />19:37:19 UTC+2 and Jul 25 20:11:09 UTC+2, involving 3 more users, but<br />none of them are grid users.<br /><br />While forensics are still ongoing, there is so far no evidence that the<br />attacker managed to obtain root access at CERN.

EGEE/CERN Security officer has not confirmed whether this user's X509 certificate is also compromised.

6) Cambridge pcet.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk - Breakin 2008-07-14 18:56 UTC+1:<br /> The same rootkit has been found at the host<br /> cet.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk (131.111.66.23), which belongs to one of<br /> UK GridPP sites. It appears to have been installed on *14 July<br /> 2008 at 18:56*. From the datestamp on the sshgrab.py file and<br /> Cambridge CERT reports on traffic to 136.159.55.31 it appears<br /> that the ssh keys were collected up to 25 July. The site<br /> involved is actively investigating into it. NOT OSG<br /><br />7) UK RAL Tier1 has detected a successful ssh login from the malicious IP<br />(216.186.49.132).

However, this does not seem to affect OSG site. We asked for confirmation. Below is JimBarlow's initial report.

The uiuc.edu cluster below is actually hosts on NCSA's network. We discovered<br />the compromised accounts on 7/26 and pretty much cleaned up from the<br />incident. A report was sent to the TG incident-report email address and<br />discussed on TG security-wg incident calls. When the DFN-CERT sent out<br />information to the FIRST mailing list I responded to them with our information,<br />which is how it came to be included in the information below. I am working<br />with DFN-CERT on this a bit more to see what comes forth. If anyone wants<br />to know more info, then let me know.

<br />15) Harvard - No contact yet. 131.142.42.17 might be involved. Breakin or attempts from 216.186.49.132 2007-07-25 and 131.142.42.17<br />Harvard has several resources registered with OSG. We sent an email and asked site admin for confirmation (Ian Syokes-Rees).

16) University of Minnesota - Attempts from 216.186.49.132 at 2008-07-25<br />17:28:30 GMT to 22:37:35 GMT. Does not look like they gained access. Not an OSG member

---+++ User Affected So Far

There are two users known to be affected so far.

1) Karl Harrison's account at CERN has been compromised (reported and suspended by Atlas on 08-05-2008). EGEE/CERN Security officer has not confirmed whether this user's X509 certificate is also compromised. In OSG, this user has the following access rights:

"/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Cambridge/L=UCS/CN=karl harrison002" "/atlas" usatlas4

Atlas and USAtlas Security Officers have confirmed that the last activity submitted by this user is dated 2006-04-12 10:15:58. They think that there should not be any active jobs submitted by this user recently. Atlas officers have removed this user from the Atlas VOMS as a precaution and will ask him to get a new certificate.08-05-2008

2) Frederic Brochu's account has been compromised on UK RAL Tier1 reported on 08-06-2008. His DN is "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Cambridge/L=UCS/CN=frederic brochu" with FQAN /atlas, and mapped into usatlas4 in default OSG There is so far no evidence that the private key of the certificate of both users has been compromised. Atlas security officer agreed to suspend this user from Atlas VOMS server.

---++ Incident Log (continued)

08-07-2008 9am: Ian stokes Rees responded to our email saying that none of the OSG resources under his control at Harvard has been affected

08-07-2008 we did gratia queries over Karl and Frederic's certificates across all OSG reporting sites.

the query used for these searches is:

select * from VOProbeSummary where CommonName like "%karl harrison%"

We found a single record for Karl
|  *#* | |  *EndTime* | |  *VOName* | |  *ProbeName* | |  *CommonName* | |  *ResourceType* | |  *Njobs* | |  *WallDuration* | |  *CpuUserDuration* | |  *CpuSystemDuration* |

| *Number of records = 1*  |||||||||||||||||||

Apparently job has ended long before

and we could not find any job record from Frederic

08-07-2008 5:30 pm: emailed John Huth at harvard to confirm usatlas at harvard is secure

08-08-2008 11:00 am Have not heard from John Huth. Emailed Suvendra Nath Dutta and John Brunelle : both aregris security contacts.

Immediate response from them received. Suvendra does not see any malicious IPs in its network logs.

08-08-08 11:30 am: Another response from Suvendra Nath Dutta

The 216.186.49.132 address appears to be a washington address:

% whois -h whois.arin.net 216.186.49.132 Washington State K-20 Telecommunications Network WA-K20-BLK3 (NET-216-186-0-0-1) 216.186.0.0 - 216.186.127.255 Quinault Lake School District No. 97 WSKT-58 (NET-216-186-49-128-1) 216.186.49.128 - 216.186.49.255

# ARIN WHOIS database, last updated 2008-08-07 19:10

# Enter ? for additional hints on searching ARIN's WHOIS database.

The 131.142.42.17 is in fact a Harvard address at the Center for astrophysics. Steve Beikman [[mailto:sjb@head.cfa.harvard.edu][]] informs us:

"131.142.42.17 was taken off line two weeks ago. On the morning of Friday, July 25, around 10:30am, it's network disabled. We've been investigating this since. US and German CERT are involved, along with several .edu and research sites."

08-19-2008: This incident is ongoing.

Still no OSG sites known to be affected. Received a list of additional IPs from Romain, and they do not match any OSG hosts.

Received a longer list of IPs from DFN-CERT, and OSG sites appear to be involved. Jim and Doug are investigating.
