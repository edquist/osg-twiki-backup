*Software*: Hadoop - HDFS installations
<br>
*Severity*: Critical
<br>
*Summary*: A third party discovered world-writable US CMS Tier2 Hadoop instances. OSG received report of a potential security issue in HDFS installations at US CMS T2 sites. Report received from WLCG Security Officer, Romain Wartel on May 9th, 2016. After an initial check done by Brian Bockelman, it was found that three T2 sites were exposed and one of them had unknown status.

   * T2_US_MIT -Administrator: Maxim Goncharov-: Off-site access has been removed. Tried accessing the URL given at the proof-of-concept, not accesible anymore.
   * T2_US_Purdue -Administrator: Manoj Kumar-: Confirmed that off-site access has been removed. 
   * T2_US_Wisconsin -Administrator: Ajit Kumar and Dan Bradley-: Confirmed that off-site access was removed. Tried accessing the URL given at the proof-of-concept, not accesible anymore.
   * T2_US_Caltech -Administrator: Wayne Hendricks-: Caltech had an Unknown status at Brian's initial assessment. The admin confirmed that their Hadoop hosts have only local non-routable IPs.  The only way to access files in Hadoop from outside our internal VLAN is through Gridftp or xRootd. Caltech site were configured correctly.

US CMS T3 sites were also contacted to check their HDFS installations. 

Some HDFS installations at T2 sites are still running in non-secure mode. Despite of restricting off-site access, the HDFS installations are still vulnerable to insider attacks.

Followed this tutorial to perform simple attacks to Hadoop installations running in non-secure mode: [[http://blog.samoylenko.me/2015/05/25/hadoop-without-kerberos-examples/][http://blog.samoylenko.me/2015/05/25/hadoop-without-kerberos-examples/]]

*Severity*: Medium
<br>
*Summary*: An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate which, when parsed by NSS, could cause it to crash, or execute arbitrary code, using the permissions of the user running an application compiled against the NSS library
