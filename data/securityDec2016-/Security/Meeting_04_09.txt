*NEW Action Items* 

Anne pointed the following list to us. 

*Security/EmailLists* (see the red text; also I commented out the "abuse" list) 

*Assignee: Mine*, I emailed the facility list to clear this up. Done
   
*Documentation/OsgFaq#Security_and_Certificates* (please read all entries in this section; I added in the questions you suggested but I don't know if I got all the info right. See red text for info you need to add)

*Assignee: Doug* -- can you please fill out the FAQ session . see security and certificates FAQ link on our main security web site.

*Security/WebHome* (I added link to OsgFaq (above). Is it prominent enough?

*yes. Doug* can change it if he doesn't like it.

I still think you need entries on this page under *security awareness* for site admins and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo admins, but I don't have info to put there, so I didn't create.)

*Assignee: Mine -- Done*  

*Security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting* (I shortened and tried to clarify; I still found it a bit confusing and redundant. Missing text is just commented out.)

*Assignee: Doug* will check the incident response submission form and the web site.

*Incident Submit Form*: I tested the form and had to go through a half dozen steps to send it after hitting Submit (I use Firefox browser but Outlook mail). It wanted to send encrypted, I unencrypted it; not sure if I had to...

*Assignee: Doug* was working on this

*Security/PoliciesProcedures* (I didn't change this page, but I suggest moving link to Incident Response Plan to here; I don't think it belongs on the "report an incident" page. People should go there ONLY to report an incident.)

*Assignee: Mine* -- done
