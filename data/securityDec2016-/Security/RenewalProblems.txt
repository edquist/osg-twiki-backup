---++Problems with Renewing a Certificate
   1 The link given to the renewal page is wrong. it takes you to the general web site. there is no link for the renewal page. Both renewal and new certificate are under the same address 
   1 The word renew is used in the email text, but a replacement web page is only available. renewal and replacement are not the same things and one of them, possibly the email text should be changed. 
   1 Emails for renewing the certificate continues until it expires even after the user gets a new certificate. This is confusing to the new users. That prompts them to request new certificates, thinking the process did not work. It does say in the email that it will continue emailing but people does not read everything. if the user requests multiple certificates, they will all have the same DN but have different serial numbers. because a certificate is revoked by the serial number, this means when revoking e should revoke all the serials matching the user. During an incident, if we disocver one of the user's certs are compromised, we may forget to check for other user certificates. 
   1 Converting pem to p12 is very diffciutl. there are no documentation linked from DOE's page. the user should know how to export the cert from the browser. Save the p12 file. Convert p12 to pem, separate the key file from the cert, also separate the CA certificates from the p12 file.
