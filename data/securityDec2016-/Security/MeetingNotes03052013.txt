---++ Meeting Notes

*Anand*
   * had a long meeting on Monday focusing on Traceability project. 
   * Traceability project: Installed front end and got it to working with ITB factory. More details are on teh traceability project document. condor history logs has the site name, the command that was run, which factory, glidein_XXXX at node23.local IP address but we do not know if this is CE or worker node. The negative part is that condor history gets vanished. Talk to condor developers to make sure logs do not get deleted. 
   * Condor vulnerabilities are fixed in 7.6.10. Some sites have trouble moving up to 7.8 so they can be moved to 7.6.10 

*Kevin*
   * Lots and lots of SL security updates. Looked at all of them. Nothing major so far. apache, libxml, etc. New Java zero day. Oracle out out an emergency release. Patch  java 7 is released. java 6 is not certain. Another client browser vulnerability. No details released. The vulnerability causes the attacker to control of the browser. Let's put a blog post. 
   * Pakiti demo is scheduled. Send an email to sites before the AHM as a reminder. 
   * CVMFS. Read the Stu's security evaluation. Found major security issues and questions.
