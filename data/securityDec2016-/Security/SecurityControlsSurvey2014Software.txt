---+ OSG Security Controls Survey

---++ DATA Integrity 

---+++ 1. Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  

   * The OSG Software yum repositories, hosted at software.grid.iu.edu
   * The OSG Software Subversion repository, hosted at Wisconsin
   * The Koji service, which we use to build our RPM-based software and manage our yum repositories
   * The still-being-constructed Wisconsin ITB instance
   * The (unsupported but still existent) Pacman caches, hosted at vdt.cs.wisc.edu

---+++ 2. Have you read the OSG Security Plan, Data Integrity section 2.3.3 within the past 12 months and understand your responsibilities for the proper handling of Sensitive Personal Data, Restricted Data, Limited Distribution Data and Public Data. This document can be found at the OSG DocDB website:  https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389  

No.

---+++ 3. If your service does not store, process, transmit any data, you may indicate it here and conclude the survey.  

We store, process, and transmit data.

---+++ 4. Are you the owner of the data? The data owner is responsible for collection, storage, and treatment of the data. Although you own the core service/process, there may be another person who owns the data. If so, please provide his/her name below, and answer the following questions with that person.  

Yes, the OSG Software manager (Tim Cartwright) owns the data.

---+++ 5. Please enter data name you own along with a very brief description and the data type. The data types are explained in Section 2.3.3  https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389.	  

---++++ 5A. Name  

   1. OSG Software yum repositories
   2. OSG Software Subversion repositories
   3. Koji service data
   4. Wisconsin ITB instance
   5. Pacman caches

---++++ 5B. Description  

   1. The public distribution point for OSG Software RPMs
   2. The source data for OSG Software packaging
   3. The build system’s internal and external data
   4. The ITB instance’s configuration, mostly stored in Subversion for use by Puppet
   5. The public distribution point for the now-unsupported OSG Software Pacman packages

---++++ 5C. Type  

   1. RPMs and containing directories: public
   2. Subversion data: public
   3. RPM-based data: public; any configuration details: limited?
   4. Public except for host keys which are limited
   5. Public

---+++ 6. What is your data backup policy (e.g., weekly full, daily differential, etc.) ? 

   1. <p>The Yum repositories are owned and run by the OSG GOC, and we do not know anything about their data backup policy. However, the contents of these repositories can be recreated out of Koji, so backups are less critical.</p>
   2. <p>The Subversion repository is safely copied to a separate UW–Madison CS AFS area daily, then the standard AFS backups pick up the copies.</p>
   3. <p>The Koji data is backed up daily to another Wisconsin machine; then some of that data is copied to Indiana University weekly; also there are monthly backups of the Wisconsin data.</p>
   4. <p>The ITB configuration data is held in Subversion, see above. The host keys are stored in AFS, then the standard AFS backups pick them up.</p>
   5. <p>The Pacman caches and the rest of the VDT website are stored at the University of Wisconsin–Madison (UW–Madison) Computer Sciences (CS) department AFS servers, which receive full backups monthly and incremental diffs daily. However, there are limitations to the backups based on volume size and usage, and we need to understand these better.</p>

---+++ 7. Backups

---++++ 7A. How long do you retain the back-ups?  

   1. Yum repositories (at Indiana): Unknown – contact GOC.
   2. Subversion repository: The UW Computer Systems Lab retains AFS backups for 
   3. Koji data: At UW, one year; at Indiana University, unknown.
   4. ITB configuration: The UW Computer Systems Lab retains AFS backups for 
   5. Pacman caches and VDT site: The UW Computer Systems Lab retains AFS backups for 

---++++ 7B. How do you ensure that your data back-ups are stored correctly, protected and restorable?  

For some backups, we receive email notification when they occur, along with notification of any failures; others, there is nothing. And generally speaking, we have not had the effort available to test restorations.

---+++ 8. Please list your on-call support email address and/or phone number in case of emergencies, such as unexpected power loss, security attacks or natural disasters.  

We do not maintain on on-call presence. Possible contact points are:

* me: Tim Cartwright <cat@cs.wisc.edu>, 608-262-4002
* The Software team (and interested other people) in general: OSG Software <osg-software@opensciencegrid.org>
* The UW–Madison Computer Systems Lab (in the CS department): <lab@cs.wisc.edu> (also not on call)

---+++ 9. Are you aware of any attacks against the data? What do you think is the biggest threat against the data?  

I am not aware of any attacks. The biggest threats are accidental loss or corruption.

---+++ 10. If you own Restricted Data please answer the following questions.  

To date, we identified one file of restricted data on our systems: the key that we use to sign RPMs.
 
---++++ 10A. Who are the authorized people who can access this data? How do you determine this list of people?  

The key can be accessed by a few select OSG Software staff (who help maintain the koji RPM build service) and the UW–Madison CHTC system administrators who maintain the koji service in general. The system administration group decides who needs access from within their staff.

---++++ 10B. Do you inform the authorized people about how they should treat restricted data?  

No, but we assume that all people who have access understand security.

---++++ 10C. Which access control mechanisms applies to this data?  

Access to the host itself is controlled by ssh, and then access to the file is controlled by filesystem permissions.

---++++ 10D. Do you keep a log of accesses to the data? 

Unknown. Presumably, there is ssh login logging, but probably none on filesystem access.

---++++ 10 E. And if so, how long do you keep the log files?  

---++++ 10F. What information is recorded in the log files?  

---++++ 10G. How do you terminate rights of authorized recipients? Which mechanisms are used to achieve this?  

We rely on system administrators and do not know how they handle this.

---+++ 11. If you do not own any limited data, skip to Question 12. If you have multiple data under restricted category and each one has different answers for the following questions, please answer the questions for each data separately	 

---++++ 11A. Who is authorized to access the data? How do you determine this list of people?  

   3. Koji configuration: 
   4. ITB host keys:

---+++ 12. If you have any public data, please answer the following questions  

---++++ 12A. What are the, if there are any, access control mechanisms applied to your Public data to maintain its integrity? (An example would be a list of the authorized people who can modify the data.) 											 

   1. <p>OSG Software yum repositories: Available for public reading via HTTP. The GOC controls write access to the system, and we do not know how they do that.</p>
   2. <p>OSG Software Subversion repositories: Stored on AFS, and there is an AFS group that controls access. Also, the repository is accessible via the Subversion-over-https method; there, access is controlled by a list of userids and their associated hashed passwords. Finally, there is public read-only access via a repoview service on the web.</p>
   3. <p>Koji service data: Web and command-line access are protected by X.509 authentication and Koji’s own internal authorization system.</p>
   4. <p>Wisconsin ITB instance: Stored on AFS (see above).</p>
   5. <p>Pacman caches and VDT site: Stored on AFS (see above).</p>
