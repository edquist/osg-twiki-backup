   * cigetcert working through creating a proxy in /tmp/x509.  Includes options to store to myproxy but they're not yet implemented.  This week plan to implement that and the checking for existing proxies to skip re-generation.
   * requires pyOpenSSL 0.12 or greater, meaning SL6.7, in order to be able to support subjectAltName in host certificates, which cilogon uses.  This is the most recent version of SL6.
   * Met with Scientific Linux team about the process of getting a new kx509 rpm into SL6.
