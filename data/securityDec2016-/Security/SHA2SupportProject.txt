---++ Project Definition 

_The project definition & problem statement_

The SHA-2 support project will ensure  support for X.509 certificates (including RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates) using SHA-2 hash algorithms in the OSG environment. See HashAlgorithms for details.

%BLUE%  will SHA-1 certificates be supported as well/at the same time?
%RED% Yes. -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR%
It is an OSG requirement that all services support SHA-1 at the same time of SHA-2
At the same time we need to move the infrastructure to use RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates.The same software will need to be changed to go to this change. These proxy certificates are generated in VOMS-Proxy-init and Globus-Proxy-init can produce complaint proxyies and we need to make this the default in both these component, or we need to encourage all users to use -rfc. Does any other software generate proxies? 
%ENDCOLOR%
%RED% Besides voms-proxy-init and globus-proxy-init, other software generates proxy certificates during delegation (for example: GRAM job submission or 3rd party !GridFTP transfers). -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Goals

_The goals of the project: (Please list the goals as bullet point items)_

   * All OSG software components that process X.509 certificates work correctly with certificates (including RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates) that use SHA-2.

---++ Scope

_Scope of the project: If your goals are a subset of the problem you described above, your project is not solving the entire problem, which is fine. Just tell us which parts you are going to solve._

   * Only OSG software components are in scope. Not all VDT components.
%BLUE%  Really?? I don't understand this statement. VDT is owned by OSG - everything in VDT is in OSG? %ENDCOLOR%
%RED% Are all VDT software components in use at OSG sites? I thought some VDT components were not used by OSG but were used by other VDT customers. I have no objection to scoping this project to include all VDT components. -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR%
   * Any necessary software development will be done by the Software providers. The OSG software area will coordinate update of the software that is owned by OSG as well as delivery through VDT of any new versions of software from external s/w providers.
   * Support for RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates is in scope, particularly because JGlobus 2.0 adds SHA-2 support
%BLUE%  and SHA-1 in parallel/att he same time. 
%ENDCOLOR%
%RED% I agree that OSG software should continue to support SHA-1. -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR%
 while dropping support for legacy proxy certificates, so a move to RFC compliant proxy certificates will be needed for complete SHA-2 support.
%BLUE%  are you saying that JGlobus already supports SHA-2 but drops SHA-1?? %RED% JGlobus 2.0 supports SHA-1 and SHA-2 but does not support legacy proxy certificates. Therefore, when upgrading to JGlobus 2.0 to support SHA-2, it is necessary to also upgrade to RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates. -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR% what we would ask for from CDIGS is not what I thought? What do you mean about the compliant certs? Is this different more work for OSG? this is a VERY confusing sentence 
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Staff

_The project Lead, co-leads and support: (This is also listed in WBS)_

   * Ruth Pordes (project manager)
   * Mine Altunay (security officer)
   * Jim Basney (identity management)
   * Alain Roy (VDT/ITB)

---++ Deliverables

_The deliverables from the project: (bullet point list of documents, executables, etc..)_
%BLUE%  I don't agree that the deliverables below are correct. They are much to detailed in the weeds

Surely the deliverable is an OSG software stack and deployed infrastructure and services that serve those users, hosts and services with SHA_2 certificates?
%ENDCOLOR% %RED% OK. -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR%
   * A documented list of software with details of SHA-2 support, including:
      * Identifying software that has no support for SHA-2 and has no plans for future support. (Orphaned software)
      * Identifying software that has no support for SHA-2 currently but has future plans to achieve it, accompanied with each components' future plans.
   * Updates (as necessary) to the OSG software stack (VDT) for SHA-2 support.

---++ Level Of Effort

_Level of effort. (how many FTE for how many days). Do you need extra help to accomplish your goals, if so why?_
%BLUE% you can't know this til we have the detailed plan can you? I think it is a lot more work in Software and Alain needs to give us this information 
%ENDCOLOR%
   * ITB testing. All OSG software that handles certificates must be tested with SHA-2. 5 ITB sites at minimum for three weeks of testing cycle. 
   * Mine Altunay 0.2 FTE from beginning to end. 
   * Jim Basney 0.2 FTE from beginning to end. 
   * Alain Roy 0.1 FTE from beginning to end

---++ Schedule

_Project start and end date according to #6. If you do not get the extra effort, do you have another start and end date._

   * Start Date: Dec 16 2011
   * Target End Date: Apr 1 2012

---++ Implementation Plan

_Project implementation Plan: Description of each step needed to be taken to get the defined goals and deliverables. These steps do not have to be very detailed but they have to tell us each important phase of the project. Who will perform each step, which institution? When? And if that step produces any deliverables?_

   * Identify all OSG software components that process certificates. Basney, Altunay, Roy
%BLUE% As I said I believe the above is part of the planning phase not the executione phase. We can't write the project plan til we know this information
%ENDCOLOR%
%RED% I guess we can remove the above now that Alain has given us a list. -JimBasney %ENDCOLOR%
   * (Checkpoint #1) Make initial determination of SHA-2 support for those software components (supported, unsupported, unknown), including SHA-2 with RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates. ITB/Roy
   * For components for which SHA-2 (and/or RFC 3820) is unsupported or support is unknown, contact providers. Basney, Altunay
      * Do they support SHA-2 (and RFC 3820)?
      * If not, do they have a plan to support SHA-2 (and RFC 3820)? What is the timeline? What are the blockers (if any)?
      * Identify common issues across components (for example, JGlobus 1.x).
      * Are there operating system (OpenSSL) or other external dependencies (Java) that impact SHA-2 and RFC 3820 support?
   * (Checkpoint #2) Information is gathered for all software components. Basney, Altunay
   * Based on input from software providers, update schedule and notify IGTF of our estimate of how long we need continued SHA-1 support. Basney, Altunay
   * (Checkpoint #3) Verify SHA-2 support in OSG software components via an ITB testing round. ITB/Roy
   * (Checkpoint #4) Deploy software updates (as needed for SHA-2 support) in production. VDT team packages the patched software and releases to production. VDT/Roy

---++ Dependencies and Risks

_Dependencies/ Risks: any dependencies (such as a person other than support or co-lead listed below) that can delay your work. For example if you need operations team to help you to implement a step, please state it here. What is our worst case plan, assuming dependency is not resolved or the other team cannot help? Is there an alternate step?_

   * We depend on availability of ITB/VDT resources for testing existing software and packaging and releasing the patched software
   * A risk to the project is a change in current IGTF policies regarding SHA-2 support. Currently, IGTF has no deadline to ask CAs to perform the switch to SHA-2. It is unlikely that a deadline will be enforced. 
   * Orphaned software (no current support and no future plans to support SHA-2) may need OSG staff to perform the changes. 
   * Many OSG software components rely on JGlobus for certificate processing. JGlobus 2.0 adds support for SHA-2, but it is still in beta. We need support from the JGlobus team. JGlobus2.0 does not support httpg which is required by Bestman. 
   * We are dependent on external software providers to update their software.
   * We depend on IGTF CAs to continue to provide SHA-1 certificates until this project is complete.
   * We are dependent on OSG site/VO administrators to deploy updated software.

---++ Resources Needed

_Resources Needed: list all resources you will need for the completion of the project. This could be really anything. An SVN repository up and running, access to a database? Anything you will need as a tool to accomplish your goal_
   * ITB sites and admins to perform the tests.
   * VDT staff effort to package and release patched software 

---++ Impacts

_Who will get affected (perhaps in a negative way) by your project. When will you (refer to steps in #8) inform these parties. E.g. let’s say our   project is changing our comm. channels during the incident response. This project will affect site admins, GOC staff, security staff, EB, and our partner grids. The effect may require the effected parties to do more work or change the way they work. Thus, we have to identify this people and inform them._

   * Users will be able to use SHA-2 certificates (including RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates) with OSG. Users are not asked to take any actions. The impact will be transparent to them. 
   * Software developers will be impacted. We must inform software owners who needs to provide SHA-2 support. We will inform them after Checkpoint #1. 
   * A failure in software components to support SHA-2 will affect IGTF CAs transition to using SHA-2. We will inform IGTF at Checkpoint #1, #2 and #3. 

---++ Performance Metrics

_Performance metrics.   How will you measure the project success? Any metrics._

   * Measure responsiveness of external software providers.

---++ Monitoring Progress

_Monitoring project progress. Which steps you use as checkpoints/milestones? At the checkpoints, the security team will evaluate the project progress and existing deliverables up until that point._

   * See Implementation Plan above for checkpoints/milestones.

---++ Closure

_Project closure: when and who will decide the project is completed. What are the requirements and processes to mark this project as complete? E.g. if you develop code, you should hand this off to VDT team or ITB before closing the project, or maybe you will also join the testing process and then close the project._

   * The project is complete when the OSG production infrastructure supports certificates using SHA-2 hash algorithms.
