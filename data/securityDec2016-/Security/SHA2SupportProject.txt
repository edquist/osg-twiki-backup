---++ Project Definition 

_The project definition & problem statement_

The SHA-2 support project will enable support for X.509 certificates using SHA-2 hash algorithms in the OSG environment. See HashAlgorithms for details.

---++ Goals

_The goals of the project: (Please list the goals as bullet point items)_

   * All OSG software components that process X.509 certificates work correctly with certificates that use SHA-2.

---++ Scope

_Scope of the project: If your goals are a subset of the problem you described above, your project is not solving the entire problem, which is fine. Just tell us which parts you are going to solve._

   * Only OSG software components are in scope. Not all VDT components.
   * Software providers are responsible for SHA-2 support in their software. OSG is not offering to do software development for external packages.

---++ Staff

_The project Lead, co-leads and support: (This is also listed in WBS)_

   * Ruth Pordes (project manager)
   * Mine Altunay (security officer)
   * Jim Basney (identity management)
   * Alain Roy (VDT)

---++ Deliverables

_The deliverables from the project: (bullet point list of documents, executables, etc..)_

   * A documented list of software that supports SHA-2.
   * Updates (as necessary) to the OSG software stack (VDT) for SHA-2 support.

---++ Level Of Effort

_Level of effort. (how many FTE for how many days). Do you need extra help to accomplish your goals, if so why?_ 

---++ Schedule

_Project start and end date according to #6. If you do not get the extra effort, do you have another start and end date._

   * Start Date: Dec 16 2011
   * Target End Date: Apr 1 2012

---++ Implementation Plan

_Project implementation Plan: Description of each step needed to be taken to get the defined goals and deliverables. These steps do not have to be very detailed but they have to tell us each important phase of the project. Who will perform each step, which institution? When? And if that step produces any deliverables?_

   * Identify all OSG software components that process certificates.
   * (Checkpoint #1) Make initial determination of SHA-2 support for those software components (supported, unsupported, unknown).
   * For components for which SHA-2 is unsupported or support is unknown, contact providers.
      * Do they support SHA-2?
      * If not, do they have a plan to support SHA-2? What is the timeline? What are the blockers (if any)?
      * Identify common issues across components (for example, JGlobus 1.x).
      * Are there operating system (OpenSSL) or other external dependencies (Java) that impact SHA-2 support?
   * (Checkpoint #2) Information is gathered for all software components.
   * Based on input from software providers, update schedule and notify IGTF of our estimate of how long we need continued SHA-1 support.
   * (Checkpoint #3) Verify SHA-2 support in OSG software components via an ITB testing round.
   * (Checkpoint #4) Deploy software updates (as needed for SHA-2 support) in production.

---++ Dependencies and Risks

_Dependencies/ Risks: any dependencies (such as a person other than support or co-lead listed below) that can delay your work. For example if you need operations team to help you to implement a step, please state it here. What is our worst case plan, assuming dependency is not resolved or the other team cannot help? Is there an alternate step?_

   * Many OSG software components rely on JGlobus for certificate processing. JGlobus 2.0 adds support for SHA-2, but it is still in beta. We need support from the JGlobus team.
   * We are dependent on external software providers to update their software.
   * We depend on IGTF CAs to continue to provide SHA-1 certificates until this project is complete.
   * We are dependent on OSG site/VO administrators to deploy updated software.

---++ Resources Needed

_Resources Needed: list all resources you will need for the completion of the project. This could be really anything. An SVN repository up and running, access to a database? Anything you will need as a tool to accomplish your goal_

---++ Impacts

_Who will get affected (perhaps in a negative way) by your project. When will you (refer to steps in #8) inform these parties. E.g. let’s say our   project is changing our comm. channels during the incident response. This project will affect site admins, GOC staff, security staff, EB, and our partner grids. The effect may require the effected parties to do more work or change the way they work. Thus, we have to identify this people and inform them._

   * Users will be able to use SHA-2 certificates with OSG.

---++ Performance Metrics

_Performance metrics.   How will you measure the project success? Any metrics._

   * Measure responsiveness of external software providers.

---++ Monitoring Progress

_Monitoring project progress. Which steps you use as checkpoints/milestones? At the checkpoints, the security team will evaluate the project progress and existing deliverables up until that point._

   * See Implementation Plan above for checkpoints/milestones.

---++ Closure

_Project closure: when and who will decide the project is completed. What are the requirements and processes to mark this project as complete? E.g. if you develop code, you should hand this off to VDT team or ITB before closing the project, or maybe you will also join the testing process and then close the project._

   * The project is complete when the OSG production infrastructure supports certificates using SHA-2 hash algorithms.
