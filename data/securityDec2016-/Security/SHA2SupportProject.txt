---++ Project Definition 

_The project definition & problem statement_

The SHA-2 support project will ensure  support for X.509 certificates (including RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates) using SHA-2 hash algorithms in the OSG environment. See HashAlgorithms for details. The support for SHA-1 will be continued as usual. It is an OSG requirement that all services support SHA-1 and SHA-2 simultaneously. 

Related to this project, some software providers (jGlobus in particular) expressed their desire to also upgrade their systems supporting to fully compliant RFC3820 proxy certificates. Upgrade to RFC3820 proxies is not a requirement of supporting SHA-2; however, it is more efficient for software providers to make two related and needed changes to the authentication codes simultaneously. Therefore, investigating and providing support for RFC3820 proxies is considered within the scope of this project.

Currently, voms-proxy-init, grid-proxy-init and other software that generates proxy certificates during delegation (for example: GRAM job submission or 3rd party !GridFTP transfers) generates proxies. Current voms-proxy-init and grid-proxy-init both can be configured to generate fully compliant proxies. 

---++ Goals

_The goals of the project: (Please list the goals as bullet point items)_

   * All OSG software components that process X.509 certificates work correctly with certificates (including RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates) that use MD5, SHA-2 and SHA-1.

---++ Scope

   * All OSG software components distributed in VDT are in scope.
   * Any necessary software development will be done by the Software providers. The OSG software area will coordinate update of the software that is owned by OSG as well as delivery through VDT of any new versions of software from external s/w providers.
   * Support for RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates is in scope since some developers will make both changes while upgrading their software. (jGlobus continues to support SHA-1 and SHA-2. While upgrading to SHA-2, they decided to also provide support for RFC3820 proxies, dropping support for legacy proxies.)


---++ Staff

The project Lead, co-leads and support:

   * Ruth Pordes (project manager)
   * Mine Altunay (security officer)
   * Jim Basney (identity management)
   * Alain Roy (VDT/ITB)

---++ Deliverables

_The deliverables from the project:_

   * An OSG software stack and deployed infrastructure and services that serve those users, hosts and services with SHA-2 and SHA-1 certificates. 

   * A documented list of software with details of SHA-2 support, including:
      * Identifying software that has no support for SHA-2 and has no plans for future support. (Orphaned software)
      * Identifying software that has no support for SHA-2 currently but has future plans to achieve it, accompanied with each components' future plans.

   * Updates (as necessary) to the OSG software stack (VDT) for SHA-2 support.

---++ Level Of Effort


   * ITB testing. All OSG software that handles certificates must be tested with SHA-2. 5 ITB sites at minimum for three weeks of testing cycle. 
   * Mine Altunay 0.2 FTE from beginning to end. 
   * Jim Basney 0.2 FTE from beginning to end. 
   * Alain Roy 0.1 FTE from beginning to end. Tentative. Subject to review and acceptance by software team. 

---++ Schedule

_Project start and end date according to #6. If you do not get the extra effort, do you have another start and end date._

   * Start Date: Dec 16 2011
   * Target End Date: Apr 1 2012

---++ Planning Phase
   * Identify all OSG software components that process certificates. Basney, Altunay, Roy
   * Gather initial plans and support statements from the software providers regarding SHA-2. 

---++ Implementation Plan

_Project implementation Plan: Description of each step needed to be taken to get the defined goals and deliverables. These steps do not have to be very detailed but they have to tell us each important phase of the project. Who will perform each step, which institution? When? And if that step produces any deliverables?_

   * (Checkpoint #1) Make initial determination of SHA-2 support for those software components (supported, unsupported, unknown), including SHA-2 with RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates. ITB/Roy
   * For components for which SHA-2 (and/or RFC 3820) is unsupported or support is unknown, contact providers. Basney, Altunay
      * Do they support SHA-2 (and RFC 3820)?
      * If not, do they have a plan to support SHA-2 (and RFC 3820)? What is the timeline? What are the blockers (if any)?
      * Identify common issues across components (for example, JGlobus 1.x).
      * Are there operating system (OpenSSL) or other external dependencies (Java) that impact SHA-2 and RFC 3820 support?
   * (Checkpoint #2) Information is gathered for all software components. Basney, Altunay
   * Based on input from software providers, update schedule and notify IGTF of our estimate of how long we need continued SHA-1 support. Basney, Altunay
   * (Checkpoint #3) Verify SHA-2 support in OSG software components via an ITB testing round. ITB/Roy
   * (Checkpoint #4) Deploy software updates (as needed for SHA-2 support) in production. VDT team packages the patched software and releases to production. VDT/Roy

---++ Dependencies and Risks

_Dependencies/ Risks: any dependencies (such as a person other than support or co-lead listed below) that can delay your work. For example if you need operations team to help you to implement a step, please state it here. What is our worst case plan, assuming dependency is not resolved or the other team cannot help? Is there an alternate step?_

   * We depend on availability of ITB/VDT resources for testing existing software and packaging and releasing the patched software
   * A risk to the project is a change in current IGTF policies regarding SHA-2 support. Currently, IGTF has no deadline to ask CAs to perform the switch to SHA-2. It is unlikely that a deadline will be enforced. 
   * Orphaned software (no current support and no future plans to support SHA-2) may need OSG staff to perform the changes. 
   * Many OSG software components rely on JGlobus for certificate processing. JGlobus 2.0 adds support for SHA-2, but it is still in beta. We need support from the JGlobus team. JGlobus2.0 does not support httpg which is required by Bestman. 
   * We are dependent on external software providers to update their software.
   * We depend on IGTF CAs to continue to provide SHA-1 certificates until this project is complete.
   * We are dependent on OSG site/VO administrators to deploy updated software.

---++ Resources Needed

_Resources Needed: list all resources you will need for the completion of the project. This could be really anything. An SVN repository up and running, access to a database? Anything you will need as a tool to accomplish your goal_
   * ITB sites and admins to perform the tests.
   * VDT staff effort to package and release patched software 

---++ Impacts

_Who will get affected (perhaps in a negative way) by your project. When will you (refer to steps in #8) inform these parties. E.g. let’s say our   project is changing our comm. channels during the incident response. This project will affect site admins, GOC staff, security staff, EB, and our partner grids. The effect may require the effected parties to do more work or change the way they work. Thus, we have to identify this people and inform them._

   * Users will be able to use SHA-2 certificates (including RFC 3820 compliant proxy certificates) with OSG. Users are not asked to take any actions. The impact will be transparent to them. 
   * Software developers will be impacted. We must inform software owners who needs to provide SHA-2 support. We will inform them after Checkpoint #1. 
   * A failure in software components to support SHA-2 will affect IGTF CAs transition to using SHA-2. We will inform IGTF at Checkpoint #1, #2 and #3. 

---++ Performance Metrics

_Performance metrics.   How will you measure the project success? Any metrics._

   * Measure responsiveness of external software providers.

---++ Monitoring Progress

_Monitoring project progress. Which steps you use as checkpoints/milestones? At the checkpoints, the security team will evaluate the project progress and existing deliverables up until that point._

   * See Implementation Plan above for checkpoints/milestones.

---++ Closure

_Project closure: when and who will decide the project is completed. What are the requirements and processes to mark this project as complete? E.g. if you develop code, you should hand this off to VDT team or ITB before closing the project, or maybe you will also join the testing process and then close the project._

   * The project is complete when the OSG production infrastructure supports certificates using SHA-2 hash algorithms.
