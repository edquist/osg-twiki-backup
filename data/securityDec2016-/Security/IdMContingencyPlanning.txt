---+ Contingency Planning for the dependencies of OSG on the DOEGrids CA service.
The Computer Security Risk Assessment of OSG ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=488][doc488]]) identified the
DOEGrids CA and RA services as one of the few elements capable of causing significant disruption to overall OSG operations.
That assessment considered only human sources of threats for the core OSG assets because  physical damage caused by fire or other
natural disasters is dealt with in the security plans of the organizations hosting the services that OSG relies on.
For this contingency planning we also consider the effects of any type of disaster or disruption to the CA service operated by ESnet
on OSG operations.
To evaluate this risk more clearly and to mitigate it we want to understand the status of the ESnet PKI contingency plan and disaster recovery plan
as well as develop the OSG contingency plan in case of disruption of the CA and certificate services.

This contingency planning is modeled on the [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-34/sp800-34.pdf][NIST publication SP800-34]]
"Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems".
This defines a seven step process consisting of:
   1. Develop the contingency planning policy statement.
   2. Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA).
   3. Identify preventive controls.
   4. Develop recovery strategies.
   5. Develop an IT contingency plan.
   6. Plan testing, training, and exercises.
   7. Plan maintenance.
The recommended three phases of actions to take following a system disruption are:
   * The *Notification/Activation* Phase describes the process of notifying recovery personnel and performing a damage assessment. 
   * The *Recovery* Phase discusses a suggested course of action for recovery teams and personnel to restore IT operations at an alternate site or using contingency capabilities. 
   * The final phase, *Reconstitution*, outlines actions that can be taken to return the system to normal operating conditions.

The purpose of a contingency plan is illustrated nicely in this figure.

The contigency plan should "serve as a user’s manual for executing the strategy in the event of a disruption".

It is useful to read Section 2 "Background" of [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-34/sp800-34.pdf][NIST SP800-34]]
for a description of how a contingency plan fits into the broader picture of a Business Continuity Plan.

---++ Steps in Contingency Planning Process
The section below hold the materials and descriptions of activities that go into developing the contingency plan but are not
the contingency plan itself.

---+++ Develop the contingency planning policy statement.
We should figure out what to write here.
In principle, it should relate to the guidelines used in performing the risk assessment in defining quantitatively what is
acceptable risk so the conditions that can cause a contingency plan to be put into action can be identified.
From the Risk Assessment document (doc488) we have the following definitions of impact.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A security event has LOW impact if it occurs less than 10 times per year and does not disrupt the perception of the OSG as a computational facility that can be relied on AND no single occurrence of the event disables the substantially all OSG’s operational Compute Element service for more than two days.

A security event has MODERATE impact if it occurs less than 20 times/ year disables the compute element service for up to a week.

A security event has SEVERE impact if it occurs 20 or more times/year or disables the compute element service for more than a week.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


---+++ Conduct the business impact analysis (BIA).
_The BIA enables the Contingency Planning Coordinator to fully characterize the system requirements, processes, and interdependencies and use this information to determine contingency requirements and priorities. The BIA purpose is to correlate specific system components with the critical services that they provide, and based on that information, to characterize the consequences of a disruption to the system components._

According to the NIST SP800-34 we should identify the critical business processes and use that to identify the critical IT resources.
We will invert that process a bit and consider what the effects are of various IT resources being disrupted.
To perform the analysis we will use the following template to characterize each resource.
---++++ Resource characterization template
   * Brief description of the resource, i.e., name, purpose
   * Points of contact for the resource
   * People directly affected by the resource being disrupted
   * Other resources being directly affected by the resource being disrupted
   * List of specific functions of the resource including TTL, periodicity, and other time-related characteristics. 

---++++ Resources
---+++++ DOEGrids CA (pki1.doegrids.org)
   * DOEGrids CA - issues X509 certificates for people and services of OSG
   * Mike Helm for CA, Doug Olson for RA
   * Affected people are CA operators, Agents, Gridadmin, Subscribers, relying parties
   * Other resources affected include all hosts & services trusting the DOEGrids CA and using DOEGrids CRLs, i.e., all of OSG.
   * Functions
      * CA signing function - internal with no direct external exposure, occurs on demand from Agents, Gridadmins and subscribers' replacement interfaces; averages about 30 time/day
      * Agent interface - 
      * Gridadmin interface -
      * Public submission interface -
      * Email notifications -
      * CRL generation -
      * Publish to LDAP -
