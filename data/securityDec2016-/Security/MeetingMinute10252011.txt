-- No discussion on grid-sec. 

--Kevin: 

--Put out the Java announcement. 

--talked to SL folks about how their build system work. they use Koji. they have a dedicated machine to sgn rpms. developers manually sign. Private key is never stored in any build system. customizations they have are very small. they have no source repository. thy just mirror the redhat for source rpms. customizations are done on the build machines. even if someone breaks into build machine, they can still get the source rpms and re-build the system. most changes are done through configure files. 

--vulnerability: nothing interesting other than java.
