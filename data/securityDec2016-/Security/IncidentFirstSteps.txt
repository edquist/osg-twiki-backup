---++ Incident First Steps

Here are some first steps to take when dealing with an incident.  We are assuming that you have already taken the step of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting][reporting the incident]].

You will first want to notify your local administrator and local security contacts (if they have not already been notified).  The local administrator may be needed to do any checks on the local system and coordinate with the local security contacts.  The local security contacts may be able to look into any of the network monitoring done at your site and determine how extensive the incident may be.

---+++ Compromised machine

If it is initially determined that the machine has been compromised then here are a couple of steps to take:

   * *DO NOT* turn the machine off.  There may be processes and/or live data that an incident responder may want to obtain on the machine.
   * Get the machine off the network so it cannot do any more damage.  The easiest way to do this will be to unplug the network cable from the machine.  If this is a remote machine, or you are not sure where the machine is, then you will likely need to contact the local security or networking group and have them block the machine at the border or at the network jack.

---+++ Compromised account

If you have determined that this incident has a compromised account(s) then you are going to want to do the following two steps:

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/BanningUsersAtSite][Banning a user]] - This will disable access for that user to your resources.<BR>
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGet#Revoke_your_certificate_if_compr][Revoking a users certificate]] - This will revoke the users certificate so it will no longer work at any site.<BR>

---+++ Additional steps

If you are tasked with looking into the incident reported then below are some additional steps you can take in doing some basic forensics on the machine.  However, if an administrator or security engineer is going to be looking into the incident then you should leave the steps below to them to insure that no data is destroyed during the investigation.
