---++ Training for OSG PKI Registration Agents and Grid Admins

The new OSG PKI that will go into operation in October, while being very similar to the DOE Grids PKI, will have changes to its interface and workflows. Hence the transition team is offering training to Registration Agents and Grid Admins.

Training sessions will be available via webcast and will involve hands-on approval of certificates via the OSG test PKI. Times and URLs for registration are below. 

Note that one change is how responsibilities are divided between Grid Admins and Registration Agents. In the new OSG PKI, Registration Agents will be solely responsible for certificates for people, while Grid Admins will be responsible solely for host and service certificates. We expect some individuals will be both Registration Agents and Grid Admins.

If you have any questions, please feel feel to contain Von Welch (vwelch@indiana.edu), OSG PKI Transition Project Lead, Mine Altunay (maltunay@fnal.gov) or Jim Basney (jbasney@illinois.edu), OSG PKI Training Leads.
