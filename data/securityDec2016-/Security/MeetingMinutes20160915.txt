   * Vulnerability reported in MySQL application [[http://legalhackers.com/advisories/MySQL-Exploit-Remote-Root-Code-Execution-Privesc-CVE-2016-6662.html][CVE-2016-6662]]. This vulnerability could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges and gain control of the server hosting the affected version of MySQL.
      * MariaDB and PerconaDB are also affected and published security updates
         * [[https://mariadb.org/mariadb-server-versions-remote-root-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2016-6662/][MariaDB]]
         * [[https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/09/12/percona-server-critical-update-cve-2016-6662/][PerconaDB]]
      * An undisclosed vulnerability CVE-2016-6663 will be published shortly. "The undisclosed vulnerability makes it easy for certain attackers to create /var/lib/mysql/my.cnf file with arbitrary contents without the FILE privilege requirement."
   * https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/31172: GridAdmins are notified by email when a certificate request needs their approval; if the certificate requestor is a GridAdmin, she could approve it right away and other GAs are not notified. A GridAdmin requested to have notifications sent to all GridAdmins in a VO whenever a certificate request was made regardless of the role of the submitter. OSG considers that having the same GA submitting and approving a request is the expected behavior. We trust the GAs assigned to a VO and their requests. 
   * DigiCert API has been disabled for OSG: https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30812
   * Security training for new VOs will be conducted by Jeny and Zhalak next Friday at 10:00 am for SPT VO.
