---+ Plan for DOEGrids to !DigiCert Distinguished Name Transition

The [[OSGCATransition2012][2012 OSG CA Transition]] will require OSG participants who currently hold certificates from the DOEGrids CA to obtain certificates from a new CA (expected to be the [[http://www.digicert-grid.com/][DigiCert Grid CA]]). Since each [[http://www.igtf.net/][IGTF]] accredited CA must issue certificates with non-overlapping names, the certificates from the new CA will have different names (called Distinguished Names or DNs). This plan documents the implications of this name change and procedures for making this transition as smooth as possible for OSG participants.
