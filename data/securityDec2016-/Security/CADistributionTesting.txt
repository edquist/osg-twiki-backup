---+!! Testing of Changes in the CA Distribution

%TOC%

---++ Introduction
Documenting the testing of new CA certificates package and distribution.

---++ ITB distribution and new IGTF hash layout, May 2010
See [[SoftwareTeam.SEP7][SEP7]] for the proposed change to distribute CA certificates package
on the ITB independently of the production grid, and also the changes for the new
IGTF layout for the openssl V1.x hash value changes.

CA package version 1.14aITB was prepared and is hosted at
http://software.grid.iu.edu/.
To use it, set<br/>
<tt>cacerts_url = http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version</tt>


John Weigand pointed his ITB site to it and all looks good except for a CACert Expiry warning
https://gr7x0.fnal.gov:8443/rsv/gr7x0.fnal.gov/index.html#org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry.

Iwona installed it on her ITB site using the Debian packaging and authentication, srm-ping
work fine but gets the same RSV probe warnings:
https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/wizardcurrentstatus/index?datasource=currentstatus&current_status_attrs_shownc=on&r=on&r_58=on
<verbatim>
Cert Expiry 
ERROR: Few of the files in your installations are out of sync with the OSG distribution.
 The CA that are out of sync are: 1149214e 9b59ecad 16da7552 b93d6240 
 Please ensure that your CA update process (e.g. vdt-update-certs or yum update) is configured
</verbatim>

The CAs listed are:

<verbatim>
1149214e.0 -> DFN-GridGermany-Root.pem
9b59ecad.0 -> CESNET.pem
16da7552.0 -> NIKHEF.pem
b93d6240.0 -> NERSC-SLCS.pem
</verbatim>

5/17/2010 - Nothing obvious wrong with those CAs. I have asked Anand about those RSV messages.
