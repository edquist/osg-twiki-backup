Note that there are now several IP addresses in the 69.128, 69.129 and 69.130 network blocks. Any connection from these locations should be treated as suspicious and verified with the appropriate user(s). Note however that at least one connection from 69.129 has been confirmed to be legitimate.

* Update on the rootkit *

In many cases, the attacker gains root access by exploiting known vulnerabilities, it is therefore essential to ensure Linux hosts are kept up-to-date with security patches.

Recent kernels should prevent Phalanx (and similar rootkits) to be injected via /dev/mem modifications (both RHEL 4 and RHEL5 have released kernels to implement this). Beware however that a new version "2.3c" of the Phalanx rootkit has been seen in the wild, which first tries to inject the malware via /dev/mem, but in case it does not succeed, it tries to load the malware as a standard Linux Kernel Module (LKM).

As per the last update, while the attacker has mostly been concentrating on SSH keys, it seems that standard passwords are being sniffed and reused also.

It has also been discovered that connections to the backdoor can produce the following syslog message (usually in /var/log/secure, /var/log/message):

---------------8<------------------
sshd[XXXX]: Disconnecting: Bad packet length 1883783500.
---------------8<------------------
(where XXXX is the PID of sshd)

Although the rootkit hides in different locations (ex: /usr/lib/heahu.p2/, /usr/lib/huuuh.p2, etc.), at least the 64bit version of the 2.2c backdoor does not support some characters and should segfault using this command:

(echo SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8.1p1; sleep 1; echo 'pHALANX2!'kill_phalanx2'+++++++++++++++'| cut -c 1-31; sleep 1; echo 'test'; cat)|nc <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> 22

(<POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> is the hostname that is checked for signs of the rootkit)

The resulting syslog message on <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> would look like:
<DATE> <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> kernel: <malicious_kernel_thread>:
segfault at 0000000000000000 rip 0000000000418900 rsp 0000007fbfff8698 error 4

Once the host has been probed, the existence of such a syslog message is a very strong indication it has been infected by the rootkit.
