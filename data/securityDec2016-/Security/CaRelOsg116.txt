Dear CAs, Relying Parties, Users, and all others interested,

In this announcement of the IGTF:

   1. Updated IGTF distribution version 1.37 available
   2. Distribution format changes in the wake of OpenSSL version 1

=========================================================================
1. Updated IGTF distribution version 1.37 available
=========================================================================

A new distribution of Accredited Authorities by the EUGridPMA, based
on the IGTF Common Source, is now available. It includes the newly
accredited Authorities by all IGTF Members and retires expiring CA
certificates. This is version 1.37, release 1, and it is now available for
download from the Repository (and mirrors) at

   https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/
   (traditional format)

   https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current-new/
   (new format)

*** note that the default format will change in the next release 1.38 ***

Changes from 1.36 to 1.37
-------------------------
(27 September 2010)

* Added accredited classic TERENA eScience SSL CA and hierarchy (EU)
* Discontinued NGO-Netrust CA (SG)
* The OpenSSL1 compliant format no longer adds symlinks for info metadata
 (such references would result in multiple downloads of the same CRL data
 when used with FetchCRL3)
* Corrected typo errors in namespaces file for AAACertificateServices (EU)
* Added CILogon CAs in experimental area (US)

This 1.38 release has been built with RPM version 4.4.2.3 and Java 1.6.

If you part of a coordinated-deployment project (such as a national
grid initiative, EGI, OSG, PRACE, DEISA, NAREGI or others) you may want to
await your project announcement before installing this release.
The download repository is also mirrored by the APGridPMA at
   https://www.apgridpma.org/distribution/igtf/

Next Release
------------
The next release of the distribution is expected in November 2010.


=========================================================================
2. Distribution format changes in the wake of OpenSSL version 1
=========================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTICE
----------------

 This 1.37 distribution comes in two (2) formats. The primary format
 for this 1.37 release is the 'current' one, which has no material
 changes. The upcoming format is also available at:
   https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current-new/
 and supports also OpenSSL v1 and is designed to be backwards compatible
 with the current distribution format.

 *** YOU ARE INVITED TO EVALUATE THIS NEW DISTRIBUTION FORMAT NOW ***

 In the next release (1.38), the 'default' distribution will change to
 the new format and the current format will be depricated and only
 available via a special URL. The default download location
   https://dist.eugridpma.org/distribution/igtf/current/
 will then point to the new-format distribution.

 Releases after 1.39 (Early 2011) may withdraw this then-depricated
 format and from then on only the 'new' format will be distributed.

---+++ Deployment plan
In this release the default format is still the old (current) format and
the one with symlinks is still in the "new" category.
So I think the way to publish this is to make a distribution in
the current format that goes to ITB and then quickly to production.
Follow this one rather quickly with another distribution in the "new" format
that goes to the ITB, and we will put CILogon Basic in this second one.
