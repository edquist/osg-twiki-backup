Security Coordination Team, the OSG security team, CfA Harvard, ISI 
University of South California, CERN security team and several CSIRTs

******************************

Several sites reported compromised accounts and root compromised hosts.
A large number of connections attempts against many sites have been 
detected from 82.145.72.17.

It is believed the attacker is actively using an exploit for 
CVE-2009-1185/CVE-2009-1186 (udev):
https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0427.html
http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0904&L=scientific-linux-errata&T=0&P=1842

Note that RHEL4/SL4/SLC4 are not affected by this vulnerability.

************************************************

- 136.159.55.31

Note that there are now several IP addresses in the 69.130 network
block. Any connection from this location should be treated as suspicious
and reported.

* Update on the rootkit *

In many cases, the attack gains root access by exploiting known 
vulnerabilities, it is therefore ensuring Linux hosts are up-to-date 
with security patches is essential.

Recent kernels should prevent Phalanx (and similar rootkits) to be 
injected via /dev/mem modifications (both RHEL 4 and RHEL5 have released 
kernels to implement this). Beware however that a new version "2.3c" of 
the Phalanx rootkit has been seen in the wild, which first tries to 
inject the malware via /dev/mem, but in case it does not succeed, it 
tries to load the malware as a standard Linux Kernel Module (LKM).

As per the last update, while the attacker has mostly been concentrating 
on SSH keys, it seems that standard passwords are being sniffed and 
reused also.

It has also been discovered that connections to the backdoor can produce 
the following syslog message (usually in /var/log/secure, /var/log/message):

---------------8<------------------
sshd[XXXX]: Disconnecting: Bad packet length 1883783500.
---------------8<------------------
(where XXXX is the PID of sshd)

Although the rootkit hides in different locations (ex: 
/usr/lib/heahu.p2/, /usr/lib/huuuh.p2, etc.), at least the 64bit version 
of the 2.2c backdoor does not support some characters and should 
segfault using this command:

(echo SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8.1p1; sleep 1; echo 
'pHALANX2!'kill_phalanx2'+++++++++++++++'| cut -c 1-31; sleep 1; echo
'test'; cat)|nc <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> 22

(<POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> is the hostname that is checked for signs 
of the rootkit)

The resulting syslog message on <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> would look 
like:

<DATE> <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> kernel: <malicious_kernel_thread>: 
segfault at
0000000000000000 rip 0000000000418900 rsp 0000007fbfff8698 error 4

Once the host has been probed, the existence of such a syslog message is 
a very strong indication it has been infected by the rootkit.
