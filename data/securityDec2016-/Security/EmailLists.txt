---+ Security Email Lists

All email lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain.

*security* is the standard email address open to the OSG public %RED%for reporting of security incidents%ENDCOLOR%. Mail to *security* is received by the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC). It is monitored 24x7 and filters for SPAM or other off-topic content. Emails to this address opens or updates a security incident ticket and are forwarded to the INCIDENT-REPORT-L or INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L lists as appropriate (see below). The GOC acts immediately on all mail incoming to this address.

*osg-security-team* is the contact list for the OSG security team.

*tg-security* (security technical group) is open to all OSG members, partners and collaborators for general discussions of OSG security. Posts to this list are considered public. Please use this list for discussions of non-sensitive topics.

*security-discuss-l* (also known as *security-discuss-OSG_LIMITED_DISTRIBUTION) is a closed list for discussions of internal OSG security issues amongst the OSG Security team and other OSG staff. This list includes limited data, which is only related to OSG business. The limited data is classified as any data that should only be accessed by an authorized group of individuals. The recipients of limited data can re-distribute to third parties if the first recipient deems the third party trustworthy and the re-distribution does not break the use care agreement between the first recipient and the data owner.

*incident-report-l* is a closed list comprised of the OSG incident response team. The list is intended solely for initial incident reporting - not for incident discussion. All email to this list is echoed to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L and mail REPLY TO: is configured to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L. Because this list is restricted solely to the initial reporting of an incident, inbound communications to this list can be used to drive alerting mechanisms - e.g. alarms in support centers, level-1 messages to Blackberrys, etc., so posts should be short or start with a short summary, since these mechanisms have character limits (SMS has a 160 character limit). Communications on this list should be digitally signed.

*incident-discuss-l* is a closed list comprised of the same members as INCIDENT-REPORT-L. The list is intended for discussion of reported incidents, including sensitive information that should not be redistributed outside the OSG incident response team. Communications on this list should be digitally signed.

*osg-peergrid-csirt-l* is a closed list comprised of the members of INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L plus vetted incident response contacts from OSG peer grids (EGEE, !TeraGrid, WLCG, etc.). We use this list to share cross-grid incident information. Information posted to this list should be considered sensitive.
