---+ Security Email Lists

All email lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain. 

*tg-security* provides communication among, OSG, OSG partners and external collaborators. The current list of members have not been changed. This list includes public data. This list will be used for announcements to our partners and will have a decreased workload compared to the past. OSG staff's day-day discussion will be removed from this list and moved to the security-discuss-l.

*security-discuss-l* (also known as *security-discuss-OSG_LIMITED_DISTR*) provides communication among OSG Security team and related OSG Staff. This list is to discuss OSG security team's day-day activities and internal planning.  This list includes limited data, which is only related to OSG business. The limited data is classified as any data that should only be accessed by an authorized group of individuals. The recipients of limited data can re-distribute to third parties if the first recipient deems the third party trustworthy and the re-distribution does not break the use care agreement between the first recipient and the data owner. 

*security-discuss-restricted* provides communication among OSG Staff. This list only includes restricted data. Restricted data has more stringent access requirements than the limited data: restricted data has a precise list of authorized individuals and re-distribution to third parties is not allowed. This list is used for discussing security vulnerabilities and emergencies. This list is not for general discussion, and the frequency of usage must be relatively low with respect to other lists. Therefore, an email message coming through this channel must be immediately noticed and paid attention. 

*security* and *abuse*: Are the standard email addresses for public reporting of security incidents. Mail to these addresses is received by the iGOC OSG Operations Support Center. The 24x7 iGOC filters the mail for SPAM or other off-topic content, opens or updates a security incident ticket, and forwards the orginal e-mail along with ticket information to the INCIDENT-REPORT-L or INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L lists as appropriate (see below). The iGOC acts immediately on all mail incoming to this address.

*incident-report-l* is a closed list comprised of the primary grid security contacts for all sites and support centers. The list is intended solely for initial incident reporting - not for incident discussion. All email to this list is echoed to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L and mail REPLY TO: is configured to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L. Because this list is restricted solely to the initial reporting of an incident, inbound communications to this list can be used to drive alerting mechanisms - e.g. alarms in support centers, level-1 messages to Blackberrys, etc. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.


*incident-discuss-l* is a closed list comprised of the same members as INCIDENT-REPORT-L plus other grid security contacts who are concerned with incident discussion. The list is intended for discussion of reported incidents. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.
