---++Meeting Minutes

We are holding the meeting a day late due to the service problems with the DOEgrids root ca. The root ca CRL service was not available yesterday. This caused us postpone the meeting and work on the issue immediately. The outage caused access problems to cern sso server, and also error warnings on grid nodes. 

   * Jim: The incident at ESA is on the radar. Jim got the list of the compromised user accounts. He is writing a script to find out which/if any osg users are affected. We do nt think there would be a lot of cross-overs. Jim will ping European handlers to understand more about the attack vector. ESA grid portal uses common grid tools such as myproxy and gridftp. we would like to know if there are any vulnerabilities that can be applicable to OSG portals. 
   * Jim will work with Alain on sending security announcements to software developers. We may creating a new OIM role/group for software developers. We do not have a contact type for software developers for broad announcements.  For the vulnerabilities that affect VDT software, the VDT team leads software vulnerability assessment process. We do not have a clear process for more broad general announcement types. 
   * Jim has some effort problems. Mine should talk to Chander and Ruth.
