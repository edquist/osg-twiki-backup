---+ Robot Certificates
---++ Introduction
Several use cases exist for the need of automated processes  to act on behalf of a person.
Such as RSV monitoring, data processing production (CDF), distributed data colleciton
systems (Mariachi), and others.
These are processes which act as clients and possibly as servers, not necessarily
located on a specific host or may be moved from one host to another, and
are unattended, so that decrypting the private key with a passphrase in not feasible.
The description below are proposed changes to the DOEGrids CP/CPS to
define these types of robot certificate.

I would point out that some similar use cases, and some versions of those above
are actually satisfied with our existing OU=Services certificates performing
as clients.  One can argue that this is the only case where an unencrypted private
key is allowed on disk and that OU=Robots should be strictly on hardware tokens,
but that is not my suggestion below.
---++ Use Cases
---+++ Questions
   1. Describe the intended use and purpose.
   2. Is the certificate identifying a client or server, or both?
   3. How many instances of the robot or automated process need access to the private key?
   4. An individual is responsible for the certificate.  How often will this individual interact with the robot process?  
   5. How long will it run unattended before someone notices that something has gone wrong? In other words, how will it be monitored?
   6. Can a certificate with private key stored only on a hardware token be used?  If not, what protections can be used to ensure that the private key is not compromised?
   7. Why is it not possible to locate the process on a specific host, so a service certificate may be used?

---+++ 1.1.1 General Definitions
%BLUE%
<b>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</b><br>
A hardware device for storing private keys and performing cryptographic operations meeting FIPS 140.

<b>Robot Certificate</b><br>
A certificate for an unattended service or process running on behalf of a person.

---+++ 1.3.3 End Entities
DOE GRIDS PKI issues Person, Host%BLUE%, Robot%ENDCOLOR% and  Service 
certificates to scientists, engineers, graduate students, and others working on 
Department of Energy Scientific Research programs as allowed in the ESnet AUP

For a person certificate it will be the subscriber, but for a host%BLUE%, robot%ENDCOLOR%
or service certificate the end entity may be some process running on a machine.


---+++ 1.3.4 Applicability

%BLUE%<b>Robot certificates</b> can be used to identify a person responsible for an 
unattended service or process acting as client and/or server.  
These certificates may be used to authenticate the service to another Grid entity, 
possibly by signing proxy certificates.%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ 2.1.2 Subscriber Obligations
%BLUE%For Robot Certificates
   1. Store the private key encrypted whenever possible.
   2. The private key may be kept unencrypted on an HSM or on a single user host dedicated to purposes identified by the certificate.  There must never be more than a single copy of the unencrypted private key on persistent storage.
   3. Provide correct personal information and authorize the publication of the certificate
   4. Verify that the DN being requested does not yet exist, or assert that they are the registered owner of the DN.
   5. Notify DOE GRIDS PKI immediately of any security incidents. Notification shall occur within the first 12 hours of initial knowledge of incident.
   6. Use the certificate for the permitted and declared uses only. The declared use should be a recorded statement describing the application, the private key management and the group permitted to affect the use, if more than one person.

---+++ 3.1.2 Name Meanings
For individuals, the value of the CN component of the DN has no semantic significance.  
It should have a reasonable association with the authenticated name of the subscriber.  
%BLUE%For Robots, the value of the CN component of the DN has no semantic significance.  
It should have a reasonable association with the authenticated name of the subscriber.  %ENDCOLOR%
For Hosts or Services, the CN component has a structure that is defined to support SSL/TLS and the 
Globus software. It should include the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the host.

---+++ 3.1.3 Uniqueness of names
%BLUE%
For robot certificates each CN component will include the Full name of the subscriber as 
determined by the Virtual Organization/Site&#8217;s RA as well as a label reflecting the purpose of the robot entity.  
Certificates must apply to unique individuals. 
Private keys associated with Robot certificates may not be shared between people.
