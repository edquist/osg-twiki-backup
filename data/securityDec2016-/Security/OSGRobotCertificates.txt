---+ This is a draft of a possible new policy for OSG Security

---+ OSG Robot Certificates

---++ Definition
Robot Certificates are a special case of a personal certificate, for use by processes that run without human interaction, and are not tied to specific hosts. If the process/service runs on specific hosts, a host or service certificate would probably be a better choice.

Robot certificates are issued to a particular OSG user, who will be responsible for any and all uses of the certificate.

---++ Requirements
   * Robot certificates, because of their usage patterns, may have their private key stored unencrypted,  because of this, additional restrictions are placed on their use.
   * Systems that have robot certs installed must be professionally administered and have regular security patching procedures in place.
   * if the key is stored unencrypted:
      * Systems with robot certs should be limited to a single user in addition to system administration staff.
      * Robot cert private keys should be stored on secured removable media.
      * There should not be more than one copy of a robot cert installed at a given time.

---+ How to apply
   * Robot certificates can be applied for by requesting an OSG personal certificate with a name of the form of "firstname lastname Robot" or similar.
   * Robot certificates should be revoked when no longer needed.
