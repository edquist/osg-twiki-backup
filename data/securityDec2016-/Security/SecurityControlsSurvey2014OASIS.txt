This document provides information regarding the oasis-login component of the oasis service. Oasis-login is different from the other services hosted by the GOC in that a limited number of non-GOC staff people are allowed to login to the machine. Provided in this document are answers to the survey questions only when they are different from those provided in the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityControlsSurvey2014GOC][main document]].

---++DATA Integrity 

---+++ 1. Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  
oasis-login

---+++ 12. If you have any public data, please answer the following questions  

---++++ 12A. What are the, if there are any, access control mechanisms applied to your Public data to maintain its integrity? (An example would be a list of the authorized people who can modify the data.) 											 
 Means to update data are described in detail [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/UpdateOasis][here]]. People are authorized to access oasis-login by GOC staff via an interface in OIM. This access must be approved by the manager of the VO requesting access. 

---++Physical/Console Access Control
 
---+++ 5. According to the OSG Security Plan, network login or command line access to a production core OSG system shall be permitted only from a client via secure authorization and authentication mechanisms. Describe which authorization and authentication mechanisms you are using for secure network login or command line access by privileged staff versus unprivileged users.  
Unprivileged users must be authorized by the VO manager of the user. They are then enabled by GOC staff. After this process completes the user is mapped to a specific account (ouser.osg, for example) on the oasis-login machine and he is able to login to the machine via gsissh using his x509 certificate.


---++ Authentication Control 

---+++ 1. Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  
oasis-login

---+++ 5. What is the authentication and authorization techniques used for non-privileged user access?  
Unprivileged users must be authorized by the VO manager of the user. They are then enabled by GOC staff. After this process completes the user is mapped to a specific account (ouser.osg, for example) on the oasis-login machine and he is able to login to the machine via gsissh using his x509 certificate.
