   * Phone: 866-740-1260 ID 8406490

---++ Kevin
   1 OSG CATests. 
      * Finished OIM functionality testing.
      * Moved CILogon OSG CA cert to separate rpm. 
   1 Fermilab KCA to Cilogon Basic CA transition. 
      * Talked to Olga. They are looking for a new IDP support vendor. Will ask about kerberos support in the process.
   1 Investigated lshell vulnerabilities. 
      * Talked to Nate Paul. Does not appear to be any unpatched vulnerabilities in lshell. May not be suitable for critical system protection, but given that a user could do anything in a submitted job, lshell should be suitable.
   1 Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill.
   1 Digicert finally getting around to fixing the backwards DN in the SHA-2 intermediate cert. Will re-submit to IGTF.
   1 will work with Dave to create a security roadmap for FIFE experiments. 
   1 Will talk to Frank W to understand his identity mgmt needs at UCSD.
   1 Oasis master key replication. Kevin will check if the master key copied to the file system gets deleted after the intermediate key is signed. 
   1 Will test Anand's ca bundle documentation. 
   1 Will find all the old documentation about the previous CA transition and give those to Neha.  
---++ Dave
   1 Reviewed the WLCG data Privacy issues. The group has not produced the first draft yet. Dave will be involved with the policy writing. 
   1 Shared account job submission at fermilab. Mine worked on this and the result is: the production team will each have their own accounts. The cron job account will have its own account which is accessible by 3-5 people. The scientist will have a shared account that is accessible by 3-5 people simultaneously. 
   1 Will write a summary of glexec traceability project. There are 5-6 possible solutions that we can take. Dave will consider very strongly how the picked solution will impact our future work in certificate-free storage access. 
   1 Will collaborate with Kevin on creating a security roadmap for Fermilab/FIFE experiments. The roadmap will include the cost-benefit analysis of switching Fermi KCA to Cilogon Basic CA as well as other options in order to submit grid jobs to the Fermigrid. The roadmap will discuss our future goals such as FIE-Connect which can eliminate user certificates and how we can get there.
---++ Anand
   1 Next week starts a 8-week long vacation. Will be back by the end of June. 
   1 OSG Connect Security assessment and drill planning will be done. But the actual drill will be conducted once Anand is back
   1 Will collaborate with Dave on glexec traceability project. 

For everyone: 
   * Everyone will bring in ideas for the OSG staff retreat in May 18-19. We need to create a roadmap for our next year plans.
