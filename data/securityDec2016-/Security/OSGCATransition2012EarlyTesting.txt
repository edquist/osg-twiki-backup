---++ OSG CA Transition Early Testing

In order to provide our user community with a smooth [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/OSGCATransition2012 transition from the ESnet CA to the new OSG CA]], we are offering access to an early version of the OSG CA software and services for friendly testing. *Please recognize there are early versions and you should expect to encounter bugs and usability issues.* This testing is meant for users willing to help test out the new CA.

Also note that certificates issued at this time are not trusted and unusable in any production context. Please take care not to overwrite any existing certificates during your testing.

If you encounter any issues during testing or have any concerns, please report them to vwelch@indiana.edu

The new CA will have both a web interface and command line clients. The web interface is available at https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificate

The command-line scripts are available via svn (an RPM-packaged version is pending):
<verbatim>
svn checkout https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/osg-cert-scripts-v3/trunk/
</verbatim>

Please note the current limitations:
   * Bulk host certificate request is not ready for prime time.

Thank you for your help in ensuring a smooth transition.
