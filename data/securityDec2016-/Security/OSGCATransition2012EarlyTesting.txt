---++ OSG CA Transition Early Testing

In order to provide our user community with a smooth [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/OSGCATransition2012 transition from the ESnet CA to the new OSG CA]], we are offering access to an early version of the OSG CA software and services for friendly testing. We highly recommend that community members wishing to have a trial run of the service prior to it going into production, should participate in this trail period. This trail period is meant for to both make sure the new CA will fit your needs and workflows as well as to shake out any bugs or usability problems.

We are also hoping current Registration Authorities and Grid Admins will try out the new interfaces for those roles. If you would like to become a Registration Authority or Grid Admin for the trial, please contact vwelch@indiana.edu

Please note: 

   * These are early versions of the service and you should expect to encounter bugs and other usability issues. 

   * Certificates issued during the trial period should not be used in any production context. If you plan to participate, please take care not to overwrite any existing certificates during your testing.

If you encounter any bugs during testing or want to make suggestions for improvement, please email them to vwelch@indiana.edu

The new CA will have both a web interface and command line clients.

---+++ Web Interface

The web interface is available at https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificate
