   * Still waiting on Jim Basney to do the changes to add the /OU= and optionally some /CN= after that for robot certs, and to change the added unique number with the first and last name to instead have /CN=UID:.  Should be done this week.
   * Last week I was on vacation; the previous week mostly I just worked on revisions to the paper.  Also did a little setup of the "dcafi" redmine git repository.
