Received report of Open Science Grid website at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][http://www.opensciencegrid.org]] intermittent outage due to DoS attack between June 11th and June 12th. 

After checking the Apache logs, it was found that the requests lines coming from these IPs are "POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.0"

“xmlrpc.php” is a php script that supports a standard WordPress function to remotely publish posts via email and get pingbacks.
It is widely used to perform brute-force attacks and do password guessing.
"One of the hidden features of XML-RPC is that system.multicall method can be used to execute multiple methods inside a single request.
Attackers are leveraging this method to attempt to guess hundreds of passwords within just one HTTP request."
