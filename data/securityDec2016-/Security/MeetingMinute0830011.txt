*Jim*:

  * Security notifications and apache vulnerability. Still no patch for the vulnerability. No date on patch release. Find out what the gums sites are doing. Ask Keith and others about the gums server. Send a temp announcement. 
  * kernel.org got compromised on the same grid-sec001 incident. 
  * Teragrid compromise. may affect OSG.
   * Jim will send out an announcement on bitcoin follow up. Most likely the same email we sent to the incident-discuss-list. Anand will help. 
   * Mine will find out what other sites are doing about Gums vulnerability.  
   * Jim will follow up with 5-7 more sites. and he will follow up with Ruth's request on effort profile. 

*Anand*
   * working on tickets 10911. site admin cannot retrieve certificate. 
   * new ticket on Ian's request. 
   * Doegrids ca did not give Anand test certificates with multiple crl_url locations. get a volunteer site to test the service cert and get a user cert. 
   * Xin needs to upgrade the CA probe. he keeps hitting the old url.  between old and new url, 4 CAs have different files. Minor differences but still it is enough to make RSV probe fail. Anand will create a new release with different md5sums in the file name and release on Tuesday. storage elements are doing well so far.
   * will make a table of which software has been migrated. 
   * document rpm creation steps for ca scripts. 

*Marko*
