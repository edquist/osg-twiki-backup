---++ Meeting Minutes 5/17/2011
   * Anand is still in India. 

*Jim*:
   * Need to subscribe the software security contacts to the listserv. 
   * Security Drill. Identified 4 sites that may be suitable for the drill. Sven is running the test this week whether the job can run on proposed atlas sites. He runs a small job to see if he has access control on the site. 
   * Next week: Jim will coordinate the drill. There is a grading the sites will be measured against.  Malware analysis is off the books this year. Doug wants to have Trash/Tier3 sites in the drill. Will notify GOC that an incident drill will happen. GOC will notify Jim as quick as possible. Malicious job will ping its controller.  
   * How will Sven/Jim notify sites that the incident started?
   * we will send a detailed email to sites on these are the steps you have to take in the initial notification email. 
   * the job has end of the week lifetime. does Sven have a web site on the drill details? 

*Marko*
   * Marko found out a possible solution for the OSG Goc tcket on firefox renegotiation . He will file this with esnet service desk.
      * GOC ticket is https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=10249. Apparently es.net tickets # PKI19204, 19207, and PKI TT
19212 are related, but Marco cannot see them.
      * This problem is described in http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-3555 and the general solution is described in http://tools.ietf.or/html/rfc5746     
      * It seems that to really fix this, DOEgrids would need to update their webserver software so that it is compliant with rfc5746. One way is to upgrade to a version of Apache >= 2.2.15 and OpenSSL >= 0.9.8m. The Apache changelog for 2.2.15 (http://mirror.nyi.net/apache//httpd/CHANGES_2.2) says
mod_ssl: Comprehensive fix of the TLS renegotiation prefix injection attack when compiled against OpenSSL version 0.9.8m or later.

      * Right now the DOEgrids page is running Netscape-Enterprise Server 6.2, at least according to the http headers returned from, for example, https://pki1.doegrids.org/ca/CertBasedSingleEnroll.html Haven't found a release date, but this software seems to be relatively old.
      * As a better temporary fix for Firefox 4 users, we might suggest that they set security.ssl.renego_unrestricted_hosts in about:config to "pki1.doegrids.org", although I haven't tested this yet. This might be better than changing the
  security.ssl.allow_unrestricted_renego_everywhere__temporarily_available_pref variable, which applies to all hosts. There is some discussion about this at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/744718.

   * Marko will find out if he will meet the end of May deadline on user documentation. 

*Alain Deximo*
   * There are no big problems with certificate requests. The only late requests are from Atlas. We contacted Willima Baltz but did not get a satisfactory answer. The late request list is sent to Michael Ernst. 
   * Alain had set up a doodle poll to meet with RA Agents. Only 4 people responded to doodle request. Alain will remind agents to respond and then decide how to proceed with the meeting. 
   * OSG RA backup personnel will send their RA request to PMA and then we will send this to Dhiva. We want to finish this asap. 
   * There has been a browser problem with certificate request and retrieval. When a customer uses Chrome/IE/Safari to submit a request, even when they use the same browser to retrieve the approved request, they are unable. The DOEgrids service only works fine with firefox. Alain will open a ticket with DOEgrids service for this problem.
