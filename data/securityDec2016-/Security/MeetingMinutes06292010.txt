This illustrates one of the issues with having multiple sources
of input for certificate requests that do not also include the
certificate renewal workflow.
For now, there is a single source for the renewal notices and the renewal
notices are tailored differently depending on if the original certificate
request came from a script or the web form.  The single web interface to
renew a certificate works for everyone, until their certificate expires and
then the instructions on how to get a new certificate vary if it needs to
correspond to how they got their expired certificate.
Maybe it's better to not try and tell people in that notice how to get
a new certificate?

can't we stop the annoying renewal notices after somoene renews their certificates. 
like a day of work. nobody but dhiva has access. 


we will tell dhiva and he will try

move the web page to goc. 

the ticket seems like a non-issue. 

next itb update at the end of summer. in alain's plan. update of rsv stuff. VDT team has a different plan for releasing the rsv probes. 
old probes will fail this check. scott needs to put the updated rsv probes into itb cycle. 
hardcoded in rsv probes in ca cache. sites need to manually change their rsv probe to test the cache.
