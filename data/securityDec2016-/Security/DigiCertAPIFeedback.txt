Generated Dec 15 based on Dec 2 Excel spreadsheet and Jeremy's experiences.

   * Lines 25, 27: Requesting of Publicly Trustable Certificates through API is low priority.
   * Line 29, Retrieve Gridhost (SSL) Cert: We believe spreadsheet is incorrect and there is no documented API call for this function.
      * We are correct about this.
   * Lines 27, 28, 30 Grid Client request and retrieval: We would like to be able to do a request and retrieval entirely within the API, without the UI and web browser.
      * E.g. supply CSR in request as with Gridhost request.
   * Line 31 Retrieve alternate certificate formats: low priority, we can do this ourselves with !OpenSSL.
   * Line 33 Revoke Grid Client Cert: Low priority.
   * Line 34 Add User Details: Don't understand what this is.
      * Related to lines 35,36 - managing users in MPKI.
   * Lines 35, 36 Approve User, Assign User Privileges: Is this for certificate issuance?
   * Line 37 Admin two-factor authentication: What does this mean as regards to the API?
      * They are going to add a requirement for a client to do SSL client authentication.
   * Line 38-39 querying for certificates: Medium importance. Not required for Pilot.
   * Line 40-42 access to logs: Highly important, Required for Pilot. Pull is a must, would like push as well.
      * They would like guidance from us on what we need.
   * Line 43 Allow Unit admin to administer multiple units: Open question....

Other issues with API:
   * !DigiCert Order #: Would like to see subsumed by certificate serial number. Alternately, an API call to map from Order # to serial number.
   * Change management: Would like changes to the API to be mutually agreed to by OSG and !DigiCert before going into effect during production.
   * Error reporting: Errors returned currently through API are unhelpful. Better Error reporting required (e.g. JSON in response with error). Would like to see in Pilot.
   * Complete documentation: Current documentation is missing input parameters, expected behavior on non-success. 
   * API Testbed: In production, have a test environment with pending changes to production API service.
