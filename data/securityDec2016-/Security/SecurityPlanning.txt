---++ Developing the Awareness and Training program
NIST SP800-50 elements to developing the program are
   * *Awareness and Training Program Design:* In this step, an agency wide needs assessment is conducted and a training strategy is developed and approved. This strategic planning document identifies implementation tasks to be performed in support of established agency security training goals.
   * *Awareness and Training Material Development:* This step focuses on available training sources, scope, content, and development of training material, including solicitation of contractor assistance if needed.
   * *Program Implementation:* This step addresses effective communication and roll out of the awareness and training program. It also addresses options for delivery of awareness and training material (web-based, distance learning, video, on-site, etc.).
   * *Post-Implementation:* This step gives guidance on keeping the program current and monitoring its effectiveness. Effective feedback methods are described (surveys, focus groups, benchmarking, etc.).

---+++ Program design
Program elements are described in the OSG Security Plan.  Materials are to be developed and acquired.
They will be presented at suitable OSG meetings (esp. the bi-annual All Hands Meetings) and will be available
