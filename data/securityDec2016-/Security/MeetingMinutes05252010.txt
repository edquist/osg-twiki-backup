---++Meeting Minutes
Anand, Igor, Mine, Jim, Doug

*Anand:*
   * RSV probe from the last week. The code uses the .txt file that tells which root certificates are IGTF and which are not. Doug thinks in index file, we should also include where the cache and the version number because the cache contents will be different (GOC and ITB) to compare against. 
   * Anand changed some of the probe codes so that it can understand the new and old layout CA. CRL probe for EGEE is broken. Once Anand gets the new Index file and he changes the parsing in his code, it should start working again. 
   * The experimental and worthless CAs do nto need to be checked in the EGEE probe. Only accredited IGTF CAs are checked. Currently the probe checks the tarball version and verifies whether the CA file exists on disk or not.  
   * Mine sent the emails for the new web page. Mine will send more documentation on the how to convert p12 to pem and link it to the new page. 
 
*Jim:*
   * ASGC CA CRL issue. The CA has published a CRL that has an earlier date than the latest CRL. Of course sites cannot download the new CRL. Doug contacted the CA and the issue is fixed. System admins had to delete the CRL by hand and run fetch crl once again. 
   * No word from Brazil site yet. 
   * the face-face meeting is at 9/8-9 at Geneva CERN. Romain will come to Hepix meeting in Ithaca, NY. We may meet him there. 
   * *Action Item* Jim and Mine should talk with Dan to understand the T3 security tutorial at ANL. If the audience will be the same as before, we can change our contents. mine has a rooster of previous meetings. Jim will check if he can come during that time. If not possible, Mine will make the presentation. 
   * CMS workshop in the summer. the date is not set yet, but we should pay attention. 
   * Standing vulnerabilities: Compiler issue. No fix and no exploits yet. 
   * Java transitioning. *Action Item* Mine will check the ticket status. Scot Kronenfeld is going to test our code if it will work with Java 6. 
   * *Action item* Generating proxies with p12 input file causes proxy output to include the root certificate. This causes a problem in xrootd.  

*Igor:*
   * Latest SSC 4. it just started and it will continue for a while. they will send us a full report on once they finish. 
   * Are there any documentation on how VOs run pilots. Igor says there is no OSG wide policy. there is a jspg policy only. 
   * CMS uses the pilot job role conventions. jspg documentation. we do not have any more documentation on how to have proper pilot jobs.

*Doug*: 
   * Mine will talk with Doug later after 5 pm CST.
