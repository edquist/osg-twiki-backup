---+ OSG Security Team Meetings

   * Meetings are every week on Tuesdays at 9:45 Chicago time.
   * Phone: 866-740-1260 ID 8406490

   * No new major vulnerabilities or incidents.
   * Built new CA cert bundle in todays software release. Has fixed digicert sha2 cert. No more OSG v3.1 releases.
   * Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill when Scott gets back from PTO next week.

   * Cert-less user separation ([[http://cd-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=5552][docdb documentation]])
      * I wrote first draft of requirements doc, and Brian extensively updated
         * Now I think it's up to Mine to decide if it's sufficient to give to Miron
      * Brian began to implement the GUMS extension for scenario 2.  He was beginning to think it was going to be sufficient for persistent storage access as well.  However he and Mischa got into a dispute over technical details, over what can be done securely or not, and Brian had to put it aside for other priorities for now.  Brian wasn't fully understanding Mischa's points, and I understood them even less.  Also it isn't at all clear how an end user would be able to access storage written with such a proxy.  Another new mechanism would need to be provided.
      * I succeeded in setting up a CILogon OAuth 1.0 demo client webapp, and got it to retrieve a certificate.  The documentation was very bad, I need to create a ticket to give suggestions on how to improve it.  Next I need to try storing the retrieved certficate in !MyProxy.
      * It's still unclear to me that using !MyProxy is the way to go for scenario 3/KCA replacement because of the tricky piece of managing access to the !MyProxy service.   I don't think it is practical to ask operations people to manage extra user ids on the !MyProxy server for those without SERVICES.FNAL.GOV accounts, and instead people would be required to have them.  If that's the case, why don't we just assume that FNAL will have a services ECP and go direct to using command-line shibboleth to CILogon every time we need a new cert.   If any site wants to manage their own authentication, require them to run an ECP.   Another very tricky piece of using !MyProxy is figuring out how to automatically renew the cert; we have talked about somehow tying it into the password expiration process, but I don't know if we can really do that.
   * WLCG Cloud Traceability
      * I learned quite a a bit at the [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/396202/][WLCG Cloud Traceability Working Group Face to Face]] meeting that I attended remotely this morning.  First, they'd like to collect syslogs from VMs, although of course they realize that those can't be trusted since the user has root access.  Beyond that they mostly talked about using standard open source tools for doing large scale external security analysis.  A favorite seems to be [[http://opensoc.github.io][OpenSOC]] which is from Cisco.  Cisco open sourced it last year.  It is built on a bunch of other open source tools, most from Apache including Flume and Hadoop, as well as !ElasticSearch and !MySQL.
   * WLCG privacy effort
      * Nothing new, although at the Cloud Traceability workshop they also talked about having to be careful to pay attention to the European privacy laws when they collect the security analysis data.

---++ Jeny
   * Security Surveys for 2015 sent to service owners.
   * Risk Assessment (ongoing) 
   * Update OSG Awareness slides
