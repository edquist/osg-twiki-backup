---++ DOEGrids CA transition to New RHCS8 software

I took some free form bullet points consisting mostly questions and reminders. 
   * There is a test instance at https://odev-vm-7.es.net:12890/ee/server/index.cgi. It is difficult to understand the inner workings of the RA logic. It has fields that are not customized for OSG. Such as user request page contains uid, full name, site id and email. I understand the fields will be customized later for osg. I would like to re-visit them then. 
   * What are the command line interfaces available in the new service? Would they cover all of our existing command line scripts?
   * Summary of RA features in the existing interface:
      * Agent request/renewal: Done through emails to the doegrids-ca. Agents email requests to the RA which then decide approval or rejection. RA sends an email to the doegrids-ca with the decision. *Wish List* We would like to move this to the RA service interface.
      * Listing of Agents: This does not exist in existing service. It is on our *Wish List*
      * Removing Agents: RA sends an email to the CA. RA can also revoke Agent's certificate if needed. *Wish List*: RA could request revocation of agent privileges in the service. 
      * GridAdmin request/renewal: Request from the gridadmin is sent via email. *Wish List* We would like GridAdmins to submit the initial request in the service. RA determines the action. Then RA logs into the service and adds the grid admin. 
      * GridAdmins Listing: RA can list all GridAdmins in the service
      * GridAdmin Removal: RA can remove the GridAdmin in the service.
