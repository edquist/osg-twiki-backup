<b>Risk Assessment</b> - no additional discussion.

<b>Dave Kelsy - EGEE-OSG policy commonalities and divergences</b><br>
The Joint Security Policy Group (JSPG) started at EGEE-LCG and now joint means EGEE-OSG-WLCG.<br>
Goal for common policies for
   * User AUP
   * Site AUP
   * VO AUP
   * Operational procedures & other policies
   * Write documents independent of any particular grid
Grid policies do not override local policies

Q: Does VO AUP make any stipulation on VOs about their software?<br>
A: No but it is a good thing for us to work on.

Things we have in common now:
   * Grid AUP
   * security incident response
   * CA approval (has EGEE approval, does it have OSG approval?)

Divergences
   * EGEE assumes sites already have appropriate policies
      * (Editorial note: Doesn't OSG assume that sites have appropriate policies?)
   * VO AUP
      * Will VOs accept responsibility for users?
      * VOs are not legal entities
      * Are VOs capable of operations & risk analysis?
   * Data privacy legal issues?
We do need to work jointly on these

JSPG is working on new top-level document policy
   * Can we have common version with OSG & EGEE

DP, DK - We need a document describing policy requirements on running services (OSG has a Services AUP)

DS &#8211; There are some parallels between business partnerships between VOs and it may be worth considering what has been learned about business partnerships.

<b>Dane Skow &#8211; !TeraGrid</b><br>
!TeraGrid Overview 
   * Peer review allocations process for NSF researchers
   * Growth area in connecting to campus infrastructures
Security
   * identity based with affiliation to a project, 
   * Central user registry
   * Access via - X509, direct login, user portal/web gateway
   * Working to use X509 as the universal identifier
   * Incident response team meets weekly (useful social & technical function)
      * TG has about 2 incidents/quarter
Participating in GIN - Grid Interoperation Now in GGF (X509 + VOMS attributes)<br>
Looking at shibbolith (gridshib.globus.org/tg-paper.html)<br>
Will try at Purdue as test for TG<br>
(Penn State, UChicago & Purdue use shib for campus infrastructure !AuthZ, for exchange/access of resources between institutions)

_discussion_ <br>
Q: What about VO name space, conflicts?<br>
A: TG agrees to use general VO namespace plan (DNS-like)<br>

Q: Can CMS VOMS attributes be spoofed?<br>
A: IF &#8211; we checked once and decided no<br>
Q: But isn&#8217;t attribute signed by voms cert & checked? (no definitive answer)

On TG people login to portals/gateways with their personal ID, then submit jobs with a VO ID.

Q: How to deal with export controls? <br>
A: Just starting to talk about it, no final solution yet.

<b>Brian Tierney -  Security for Open Science CET</b><br>
Proposal approved in base program and starts Oct. 1

Summary of work (slide 5)<br>
   * Auditing and forensics 
      * Services to enable sites, communities, and application scientists to determine precisely who did what, where and when. 
   * Dynamic ports in firewalls 
      * Services to open and close ports dynamically for applications while enforcing site policy. 
   * Identity management 
      * Services to seamlessly manage identity and access control across sites and collaborations, and to allow for rapid response to security incidents. 
   * Secure middleware 
      * Services to proactively find and fix software vulnerabilities and guarantee deployed security software is current and correctly configured. 

_discussion_ <br>
ML - hopefully we can work to create more secure software<br>
DS - are you going to be software providers or services providers<br>
ML - Wisc will do a service<br>

DP - is it clear the cardinality of audit db's is per VO?<br>
BT - many VOs liked the idea<br>

ML - so how do we work together?<br>
DP - maybe it is useful for the many people to come to you<br>
DP - Software needs acceptance work<br>
ML - we have quite a bit of work to do after we get software to include/integrate/make it work for us<br>
ML - need to schedule the SOSCET-OSG meeting for joint plans<br>
