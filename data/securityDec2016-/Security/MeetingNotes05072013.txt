---++ Meeting Notes 
*Anand*
   * is on vacation
*Kevin*
   * Writing a document for Proxy Lifetime restrictions. Risk assessment for long lived proxies. Mitigation methods. 
   * Transition to SHA-2. Will the new SHA-2 certs be compatible with OIM cert management software? 
   * Tanya is evaluating mri which has a java vulnerability. But this API is used locally not exposed to the network. 
   * Pakiti project. Trying to roll over to FermiGrid resources. 
   * CILogon. HCC VO. They claim they only have 1 active user, Derek. This sounds strange. We will focus on OSG, Engage.
