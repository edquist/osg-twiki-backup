---+ OSG CA Testing Plan

---++ Purpose
The OSG CA was designed with a modular architecture, so new back-end signing CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to verify a new signing CA is working correctly.

---++ Testing Phases

| *Phase* | *Owner* | *Co-ordinator* | *Duration* |  *Status* |
| All CA functions work correctly with the new signing CA | OSG Operations/OSG Security Team/Neha | | _4/1/15 - 4/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ENDCOLOR% | 
| Testing on ITB servers to uncover any issues with the new certs and existing OSG software | ITB Site Admins | Neha/OSG Security | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ORANGE% |
| VOs to test custom software/workflows with new certificates | VO Managers | Neha/OSG Security | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ENDCOLOR% |
| OSG Services testing with new certificates | Admins hosting services for OSG | Neha/OSG Security | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %RED%NOT STARTED%ENDCOLOR% |

---++ CA Functionality Tests

| *Scenerio* | *Use Case* | *Status* | *Notes* |
| Getting Personal Cert | Request, approve and import new certificate into browsers | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | https://ticket-itb.grid.iu.edu/goc/5185, accessed fermilab cloudvoms web interface |
| | New DN should appear in expected format | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | Example: /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=People/CN=Neha Sharma 225 |
| | Numeric prefix should be the same as in the old certificate | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR%  | 225 |
| Renewing Personal Cert | Renew new certs | | Kyle@GOC to test with a shorter lived cert |
| | Test whether users with existing !DigiCert certs can get new certificates without going through identity vetting | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | |
| | Test whether users who do not have existing !DigiCert certs go through identity vetting | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | successfully got account without an existing cert. Went through expected approval process.  https://ticket-itb.grid.iu.edu/goc/5199 |
| Revoking User Cert| Revoke certificate via OIM interface| %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | Unexpected DN showing up- https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificateuser?id=2455. Pinged GOC.  -- Successfully revoked certificate 100000271 |
| |Verify certificate's serial number appears in published CRL within expected time limit (? hours) |%GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | revoked at 2:01pm. In CRL at 2:07pm. |
| Getting Host Cert|Get host cert via command line tools | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | osg-cert-request -T -t cloudvoms1.fnal.gov -e neha@fnal.gov -n "Neha Sharma" -p 6308406791 -m "testing command line tool" -v fermilab |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=cloudvoms1.fnal.gov |
| | Get host cert via OIM web interface | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR%  | https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificatehost?id=5276 Didn't get email about cert requested |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | /DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=cloudvoms2.fnal.gov |
| Revoking Host Cert | Revoke host cert via OIM web interface | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | successfully revoked certificate serial #10000027b |
| | Verify certificate's serial number appears in published CRL within expected time limit (? hours) | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | Revoked at 2:14pm. In CRL at 2:26pm. |
| Getting Service Cert|Get service cert via command line tools | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | osg-gridadmin-cert-request -T -v mis -H 'http/pepperjack.fnal.gov' |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | CN=http/pepperjack.fnal.gov in both cases. |
| | Get service cert via OIM web interface | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificatehost?id=5312 Didn't get email about cert requested |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | CN=http/pepperjack.fnal.gov in both cases. |
| Revoking Service Cert | Revoke service cert via OIM web interface | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | Kevin Hill has revoked a certificate with serial ID:100000254 at 1:17pm 4/7. |
| | Verify certificate's serial number appears in published CRL within expected time limit (? hours) | %GREEN%PASS%ENDCOLOR% | Correct serial number in crl published at 2:22pm 4/7. |

---+++ Note
   * (1) Host and service cert request as a guest would result in notification email. But as a grid admin, won't ( osg-gridadmin-cert-request )
