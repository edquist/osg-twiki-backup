---++ Contemplating major risks

Doug
   * Insider threat to core services
   * Having one or more of the IGTF accredited CAs become signed by one of the Microsoft or Mozilla trusted CAs.  This will seriously raise the profile of the grid and make exploitation of those host/service certificates much more valuable.
   * Consider impact of outage of single point services, listserv.fnal.gov, twiki.grid.iu.edu, oim.grid.iu.edu, vdt.cs.wisc.edu

Jim's top three security risks to OSG:
   1 The ongoing ssh password and key stealing attacks spread to certificates and grid services.
   2 SHA-1 is weakened further, facilitating collision attacks against IGTF certificates before we can migrate to SHA-256.
   3 A remotely exploitable vulnerability in a common software component (!OpenSSL, !BouncyCastle, Apache HTTPD, Tomcat, !MySQL) facilitates widespread compromise of OSG CEs/SEs.
