---++ Contemplating major risks

Doug
   * Insider threat to core services
   * Having one or more of the IGTF accredited CAs become signed by one of the Microsoft or Mozilla trusted CAs.  This will seriously raise the profile of the grid and make exploitation of those host/service certificates much more valuable.
   * Consider impact of outage of single point services, listserv.fnal.gov, twiki.grid.iu.edu, oim.grid.iu.edu, vdt.cs.wisc.edu
