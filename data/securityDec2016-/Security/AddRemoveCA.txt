---+ Adding or Removing CAs from the OSG CA Distribution
This page documents the OSG Security Team procedure for adding or removing Certificate Authorities (CAs) to/from the [[CADistribution][OSG CA Distribution]].

This procedure is closely related to the procedure for [[CreatingCADistributions][Creating CA Distributions]],
since the end goal of this procedure is to create a new CA distribution that includes/excludes the added/removed CA.
However, we separate the mechanics of creating the new distribution
from the steps required for adding or removing a CA from the distribution in an orderly fashion.

The policy for acceptance of CAs in OSG is specified in
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=752][OSG Document 752]].
This procedure implements that policy.
The policy can be summarized as follows:
   * VOs choose what CAs they accept.
   * Sites accept the CAs used by the VOs they serve or notify the VO and OSG Security Officer of any exceptions.
   * OSG provides a [[CADistribution][CA Distribution]] containing the CAs accepted by OSG VOs.
   * The OSG Security Officer has the authority to exclude a CA from the [[CADistribution][CA Distribution]] if that CA is not operating up to standards. However, the ultimate decision to accept or reject a CA remains with the VOs and sites.

---++ IGTF distribution updates

The  [[CADistribution][OSG CA Distribution]] contains all CAs accredited by the [[http://www.igtf.net/][IGTF]] for interoperability with WLCG and EGEE.
Most changes to the OSG CA Distribution result from changes to the 
[[http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/][IGTF Distribution of Authority Root Certificates]],
according to the following procedure:

   1 [[SecurityTeamMembers][Security Team]] members participate in IGTF meetings to represent OSG concerns and stay informed about new and retiring IGTF CAs.
   1 Security Team members monitor the IGTF mailing lists for announcements of new IGTF distribution releases. The announcements are posted on the announce@eugridpma.org and tagpma-general@tagpma.org lists. Instructions for subscribing to these lists can be found on the [[http://www.eugridpma.org/][EUGridPMA]] and [[http://www.tagpma.org][TAGPMA]] web sites.
   1 When a new IGTF distribution is released, a Security Team member sends an email message to osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org volunteering to create a new OSG CA distribution.
   1 The Security Team member then follows the procedure for [[CreatingCADistributions][Creating CA Distributions]].
   1 The Security Team member also verifies that the VDT team updates the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/certificate_authorities.html][CA Certificates in the VDT]] in a timely manner.

The [[SiteRSVSecurityProbe][site-level RSV security probes]] depend on the synchronization of the IGTF, OSG, and VDT CA distributions.
The Security and VDT teams strive to update their distributions within one business day of an IGTF release.

---++ Adding a non-IGTF CA

The procedure for adding a non-IGTF CA to the OSG CA distribution is as follows:

   1 The Security Team determines that a non-IGTF CA needs to be added.
      * An OSG VO may contact security@opensciencegrid.org or a Security Team member to request the addition of a non-IGTF CA.
      * The CentralizedRSVSecurityProbe (cacert-verify-dn-central-probe), which monitors the VO membership information in VOMS, may alert the Security Team that an OSG VO has accepted a member certificate from a non-IGTF not present in the current OSG CA distribution. In this case, the Security Team will discuss with the VO manager(s) whether the CA needs to be added or if the member certificate was added to the VO in error.
   1 The Security Team obtains the required input to the CA distribution from the CA:
      * A PEM encoded X.509v3 CA certificate (hash.0)
      * A Globus signing policy with a namespace that does not overlap with other CAs in the distribution (hash.signing_policy)
      * The URL of an X.509 CRL (hash.crl_url)


---++ Removing a non-IGTF CA

TBD

---++ Explanation for OSG CA Distribution contents

Here the Security Team documents the reasons behind the current OSG CA Distribution contents.

The OSG CA Distribution contains:
   * [[http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/][IGTF Distribution of Authority Root Certificates]] (CAs accredited by the [[http://igtf.net/][International Grid Trust Federation]])
      * All IGTF CAs are included for compliance with the [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/428038/][WLCG CA Policy]].
   * [[http://security.fnal.gov/pki/][Fermilab KCA]]
      * The Fermilab KCA is included in support of the Fermilab and CDF VOs.
   * [[http://tg-ca.purdue.teragrid.org:8080/ejbca/][Purdue TeraGrid CA]]
      * The Purdue CA is included in support of the !NanoHub and NWICG VOs.
