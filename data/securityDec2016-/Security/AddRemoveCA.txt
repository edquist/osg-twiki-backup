---+ Adding or Removing CAs from the OSG CA Distribution
This page documents the OSG Security Team procedure for adding or removing Certificate Authorities (CAs) to/from the [[CADistribution][OSG CA Distribution]].

This procedure is closely related to the procedure for [[CreatingCADistributions][Creating CA Distributions]],
since the end goal of this procedure is to create a new CA distribution that includes/excludes the added/removed CA.
However, we separate the mechanics of creating the new distribution
from the steps required for adding or removing a CA from the distribution in an orderly fashion.

---++ IGTF distribution updates

Most changes to the [[CADistribution][OSG CA Distribution]] result from changes to the 
[[http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/][IGTF Distribution of Authority Root Certificates]],
according to the following procedure:

   1 [[SecurityTeamMembers][Security Team]] members participate in IGTF meetings to represent OSG concerns and stay informed about new and retiring IGTF CAs.
   1 Security Team members monitor the IGTF mailing lists for announcements of new IGTF distribution releases. The announcements are posted on the announce@eugridpma.org and tagpma-general@tagpma.org lists. Instructions for subscribing to these lists can be found on the [[http://www.eugridpma.org/][EUGridPMA]] and [[http://www.tagpma.org][TAGPMA]] web sites.
   1 When a new IGTF distribution is released, a Security Team member sends an email message to osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org volunteering to create a new OSG CA distribution.
   1 The Security Team member then follows the procedure for [[CreatingCADistributions][Creating CA Distributions]].
   1 The Security Team member also verifies that the VDT team updates the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/certificate_authorities.html][CA Certificates in the VDT]] in a timely manner.

The [[SiteRSVSecurityProbe][site-level RSV security probes]] depend on the synchronization of the IGTF, OSG, and VDT CA distributions.
The Security and VDT teams strive to update their distributions within one business day of an IGTF release.
