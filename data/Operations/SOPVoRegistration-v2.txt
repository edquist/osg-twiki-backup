      * Check if any contact information for Footprints ticket system or security contact has changed then add this to ticket.
      * [How do we know if the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo was already registered, other than memory? Is there a database field to indicate that?]
      * If no fields that require propagation are updated then no further action is required.  Check with submitter on why new form was submitted.
