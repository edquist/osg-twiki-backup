   * !MyOSG outage. 
      * One instance ran out of memory, removed from DNS RR. People may have observed long response times. VM restarted with twice the memory.
      * When the second instance was to be removed from RR, IU DNS administrators erroneously removed _both_ instances from RR. !MyOSG became invisible sometime after 3:00 eastern Friday. The problem was corrected at 4:00.

   * New VO Package Released
      * Removal of JDEM
      * Addition of NEES 
   * ITB release
      * RSV: Relocation of tables and modification of queries
         * Problem discovered when daily reports are generated
      * OIM: Minor change to make ticket templates configurable
      * MyOSG?, Ticket: Cosmetic changes.
      * BDII: Change to XML for status report. (No change to BDII Service itself)
