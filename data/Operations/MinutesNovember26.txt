---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesNovember19][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. Post 0.8.0 Release Status check from VOs

   * 12 Resources Updated to 0.8.0
   * Steve suspects a problem with the group ACL and GIP. He believe that if it doesn't detect a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo it doesn't execute. He's working to reproduce the problem. If there are extra entries in your GIP the BDII will not publish the data. Anand has suggesting adding a filter at the GOC. He will work with Tim at the GOC to filter malformed GIP information.
   * Horst noticed a type-o in configure_osg.sh because there was a missing "n" in "environment".

2. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Spotlight on VDT _postponed due to no representative_

3. Resource registration form will no longer allow spaces in short names

All spaces will be converted to underscores.
