We stand up several web servers and use a DOEGrids http enabled
certificate to provide ssl functionality.  Additionally, we restrict
websites to users with certain certificate DNs.  One admin I know calls
it a "certificate wall".  To enable SSL the certificate must have the
following flags set:

       X509v3 extensions:
           Netscape Cert Type:
               SSL Client, SSL Server, S/MIME

The critical flag is "SSL Server".  Without that flag, Apache chokes and
client browsers complain about invalid certs.  For our use cases, we
don't care that the DigiCert CA for OSG is not installed by default, nor
do we necessarily want it to be.  Basically, as long as that flag is
present in the certificates, it doesn't even need to be called an http
certificate.

The number we need is in the 10's of http certificates.
