---+ Move of www.opensciencegrid.org web portal and content to the twiki.grid.iu.edu 


---++ Introduction and Purpose

the purpose is to consolidate the web publishing services in OSG. The first step is to consolidate the web portal (hosted by Tilted planet, implemented in the Xeno media content management system) into the twiki. This will reduce confusion of multiple information sources and reduce effort in maintaining and cross referencing.

The goal is to complete this before the all hands meeting on 19th March. 

---++ Formatting of this Document

For the purpose of this document unfinished todo items are in %RED%red text%ENDCOLOR% and completed todo items are in %GREEN%green text%ENDCOLOR%.

---++ Administrative Changes

www.opensciencegrid.org will point to twiki.grid.iu.edu


---++ Technical Changes

 %GREEN%   
   * Move content on the current www.opensciencegrid.org web  to twiki.grid.iu.edu 
   * Identify accesses and references to www.opensciencegrid.org/XXX  for all XXX
   * Design and implement front page 
%ENDCOLOR%
%RED%
   * Point www.opensciencegrid.org to twiki.grid.iu.edu
%ENDCOLOR%

The transfer of the content is almost complete. The change in the DNS can proceed. 

There remains an issue of the ownership of the home and other twiki pages created. I also would like to talk about the "ownership" of the left links. 

There is an awk script to generate the left bar from a text file. The Left Bar is edited at the twiki page https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/WebLeftBar
