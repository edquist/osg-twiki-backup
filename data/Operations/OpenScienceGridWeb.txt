---+ Move of www.opensciencegrid.org web portal and content to the twiki.grid.iu.edu 


---++ Introduction and Purpose

the purpose is to consolidate the web publishing services in OSG. The first step is to consolidate the web portal (hosted by Tilted planet, implemented in the Xeno media content management system) into the twiki. This will reduce confusion of multiple information sources and reduce effort in maintaining and cross referencing.

The goal is to complete this before the all hands meeting on 19th March.
