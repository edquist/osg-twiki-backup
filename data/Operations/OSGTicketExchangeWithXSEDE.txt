---+ Discussion of XSEDE Using the OSG Ticket Exchange Service

---+++ Attendees: Soichi, Rob, Glenn Hope, Stephen !McNally

---++ Notes

---+++ OSG Exchange with XSEDE 

Soichi is currently going through the exercise to enable ticketing to third party (OSG<->XSEDE). Schedule implementation of production service will proceed, Glenn and Soichi are close and this will probably begin early in the new year. 

---+++ XSEDE Exchange with Partners

It does fit, folks (TACC, PSC, etc) can use XSEDE ticket system from there home environment. What does it take to set up and run this service? 

Email server and JAVA application... Lightweight technically. 

Stephen: How much effort is required to run this service? 
Rob: Soichi's current effort for OSG TX ~2 hours per week. More anticipated for initial start up but should be light once service is online. May need more effort when new exchange channels are added (new ticket endpoints come online).

---+++ Effort Requirements for OSG Operations

Minimal. Soichi will send code base to Glenn for review. After that he will offer advice to XSEDE but no specific effort will be given to set up the XSEDE service.
