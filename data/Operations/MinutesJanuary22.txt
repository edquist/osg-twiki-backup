   * As of the this CA package update the certificate no longer expires in January of 2008, but in January of 2013. All you need to do is get the update, and you're good to go.

4) Upcoming release of OSG 0.6.0

   * When 0.6.0 is released 0.4.0 will no longer be supported
   * GridCat will be decommission with the 0.6.0 release

5) Status of Footprints/Remedy interoperability

6) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * *Last update*:   Last batch of jobs have been submitted and they are running. Vanderbilt issues with authentication are recurring intermittently. So overall Steve reports things are in good standing and stats are available on the TWiki page, including jobs completed. Tim Thomas inquired as to why so few jobs are running there: Is it due to a problem? Steve said that this is not due to problems. Of the 90 submitted jobs at UNM, four are still running, so this run has been a success.
