3) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * *Last update*:   Last batch of jobs have been submitted and they are running. Vanderbilt issues with authentication are recurring intermittently. So overall Steve reports things are in good standing and stats are available on the TWiki page, including jobs completed. Tim Thomas inquired as to why so few jobs are running there: Is it due to a problem? Steve said that this is not due to problems. Of the 90 submitted jobs at UNM, four are still running, so this run has been a success.

   * *This week*:

---++ OSG RA Items

---+++ Followup items

1) Murali from LIGO wondered what would happen with certificate renewals since the CA expires in Jan 2008. Would certificates be issued for a full year if the CA expires Jan of next year? Alain Roy with VDT says the current certificate is set for expiration in Jan 2008. Doug will check on this and get back to us at the next meeting.
