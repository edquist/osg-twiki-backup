    1. Reminder that the new VO package reflects removal of IVDGL, GADU and GROW. If you are manually adjusting the VOs, please comment these out.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

   1. VO Spotlight on SBGrid: Goals to bring structural biology and its computing needs to OSG, working on getting the clusters operational with OSG, dealing with BDII problems and permissions adjustments. Condor mysteriously stopped working, and more investigation will go into this later into the week or possibly next week. There are possible problems with multiple network interfaces, addresses within a private subnet that will not resolve externally. 
   2. SE probes: We now have an SRM ping probe and an SRM read-write test, please test these. Contact Arvind if you need instructions.
   3. ITB fest: Monday and Tuesday of next week, we will not be having an operations meeting next week for this reason, but will be available by email at goc@opensciencegrid.org.
   4. RSV publishing to WLCG SAM: Your RSV results will be uploaded to SAM.
