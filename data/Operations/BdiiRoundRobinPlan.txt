---+ BDII Round Robin Setup - Project Plan

---++ Background

The OSG BDII was determined to be a critical service provided by the OSG GOC. The following page lays out the plan to achieve one of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/BdiiPlan][the goals the GOC made/makes]] in preparation for the LHC turn on and the increased load expected from the ATLAS and CMS VOs.

In addition to the existing production BDII server (is.grid.iu.edu), the GOC has installed a second CEMon-BDII collector, which will ultimately allow us to do DNS round-robin of the OSG BDII service.  The first step towards this goal is for OSG site administrators to reconfigure  their CEMon to send GIP data to two collectors -- =is1=/=is2.grid.iu.edu= -- instead of just one (currently is.grid.iu.edu). 

---++ <a name="upgrade_cemon"></a>(OSG SITE LEVEL) Upgrade CEMon 

See which of the following scenarios applies to your site, and then follow the instructions in each of those sections:

---+++ <a name="upgrade_cemon_configure_osg"></a>OSG 1.0 resources that use configure_osg.py

   * Find out if you have osg-config package, and if so which one:
   <pre>pacman -lc | grep -i osg-config 
 [X] osg-config, update from [OSG]
 [ ] osg-config-1.0.0, update from [OSG] </pre>

   * Upgrade configure_osg.py package
      * If you found =osg-config=, then do:
   <pre>pacman -update OSG:osg-config</pre>
      * If you found =osg-config-1.0.0=, then do:
   <pre>pacman -get OSG:osg-config</pre>

   * Re-run configure_osg.py
      * If you are using =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/config.ini= as your configuration file
    <pre>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.py -c</pre>
      * If you are using a different configuration (.ini) file
    <pre>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.py -c -f &lt;foo.ini&gt;</pre>
      * See Configure_osg.py twiki help page for more information.

   * Check =$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/glite-ce-monitor/cemonitor-config.xml= to ensure both =is1.grid.iu.edu= and =is2.grid.iu.edu= are configured; 
   * Then remove old stanza that points to is.grid.iu.edu -- it should look like this:
   <pre>&lt;subscription id="subscription-http___is_grid_iu_edu_14001-OSG_CE-RAW"
         monitorConsumerURL="http://is.grid.iu.edu:14001"
         sslprotocol="SSLv3"
         retryCount="-1"&gt;
      &lt;topic name="OSG_CE"&gt;
         &lt;dialect name="RAW" /&gt;
      &lt;/topic&gt;
      &lt;policy rate="300000"&gt;
      &lt;/policy&gt;
 &lt;/subscription&gt;</pre>

---+++ <a name="upgrade_cemon_old"></a>OSG 0.8 resources and/or OSG 1.0 resources that do NOT use configure_osg.py

   * Run configure_cemon twice to send data to the two collectors:
   <pre> $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_cemon --vdt-install $VDT_LOCATION \
          --server y --consumer http://is1.grid.iu.edu:14001 \ 
	  --topic OSG_CE --dialect RAW
 $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_cemon --vdt-install $VDT_LOCATION \
          --server y --consumer http://is2.grid.iu.edu:14001 \
	  --topic OSG_CE --dialect RAW</pre>
   * Check one of the following files to ensure both =http://is1.grid.iu.edu:14001= and =http://is2.grid.iu.edu:14001= are configured; :
      * 1.0 Admins: Check =$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/glite-ce-monitor/cemonitor-config.xml= 
      * 0.8 Admins: Check =$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/glite-ce-monitor=
   * Then remove the old "&lt;subscription&gt; ... &lt;/subscription&gt;" stanza that points to is.grid.iu.edu -- it should look like this possibly with minor differences:
   <pre>&lt;subscription id="subscription-http___is_grid_iu_edu_14001-OSG_CE-RAW"
         monitorConsumerURL="http://is.grid.iu.edu:14001"
         sslprotocol="SSLv3"
         retryCount="-1"&gt;
      &lt;topic name="OSG_CE"&gt;
         &lt;dialect name="RAW" /&gt;
      &lt;/topic&gt;
      &lt;policy rate="300000"&gt;
      &lt;/policy&gt;
 &lt;/subscription&gt;</pre>

---+++ <a name="upgrade_cemon_verify"></a>Verify that new setup works as expected

Once you've configured your CEMon to upload to both production collectors, using one of the instruction sets above, you should see your resource, and its raw/processed LDIF data files in both [[http://is1.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi]] and [[http://is2.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi]]. If you don't see LDIF data file links for your resource on either of the webpages. then please [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket][contact the GOC by filing a ticket]].


---++ <a name="enable_roundrobin"></a>(OSG GOC LEVEL) Make is.grid.iu.edu round robin to is1 and is2 -- proposed change date: Jan 19 2008

The GOC plans to provide OSG sites a couple of weeks following winter break before enabling DNS level round robining of the BDII service.
