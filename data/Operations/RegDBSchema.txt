The future plans for the RegDB include updates, as when Doug and I created the database, there were a lot of things that we weren't exactly sure if we would need or not.  Now, with a year+ of hindsight, I can see many things that should be changed and added to make administrators much more powerful in the management of this information.  This was a point of development when I was hired into my new position and will be a major point for me in my future.
