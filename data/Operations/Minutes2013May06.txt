---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * Discovered four sites reporting hundreds of millions of cpu-hours per day to Gratia.  (High CPU hours, zero wall time).  Glitch can occur in some versions of PBS to report insanely high wall times.  Fixed Purdue-Carter which is the only one that had APEL/WLCG accounting implications.  Developers thinking about putting sanity check into probes.
   * Had one site try to report all PBS data since time immemorial after a OSG 3.x update.  Have requested documentation fix.
   * Kernel reboots as scheduled on May 1 2013.
