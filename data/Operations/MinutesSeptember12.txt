---++Other Support Centers Tickets Review
---+++USCMS

No open issues to report. 

USCD and UW additions to GridCat, can they be added as inactive? Not at this point.

---+++ATLAS

5 open tickets - 3 regarding tikceting, 1 local, 1 MonALISA 

---+++SDSS

No one present.

---+++Community Support

No tickets.

---+++LIGO

Is there anything done to encourage sites to add new VOs. LIGO would like to see this automated at least on the ITB. Long term this should all be in a discovery service. Alan and Steve will exchange mail to discuss. David will send mail that I will forward to the communtiy.

---+++Others

Can we send out a GUMS template to review before releasing the new VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package? Rob will check with Leigh but this should be possible.

---++Other VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Topics
---+++DOSAR and D0 VOs

Privlege page URL, may contain site specific information, this needs to be pointed out in the pages. Also should this be done using the registration DB, include GUMS information as a field instead of a page?

Steve Timm will check with the D0 folk about their support center. Rob will send mail.

---+++Non-Registered VOs

Rob will request taking these VOs out of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package with the next release to the Deployment group at the next phone meeting.

---+++OSG VO 

Should this be supported by the Community Support Center? Is this the place where miscellaneous users should be put? How makes sure these users fall under the OSG charter? Doug will take this to the IEB meeting.

---+++VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Privledge Pages
http://www.ivdgl.org/~jrosheck/ivdgl-vo-privilege.html

Too much site specific information in this example page. Needs clearer documentation of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS information. Should every VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo have to come up with this? Should we just add the GUMS information to the registration. This should be addressed with the support centers group.

---++Other Topics
---+++Site Status Reporting for OSG
http://www.ivdgl.org/~rquick/site_status.txt

This will be taken to the Documentation meeting for the possibility of using RSS, and the Support Centers for discussion.
