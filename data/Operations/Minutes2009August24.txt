---++ Operations This Week
   * pyOpenSSL issue causes problems with RSV records on resources that do not have pyOpenSSL on system by default. This causes the Gratia transfer mechanism used by RSV to fail. VDT is testing the fix in the ITB.
   * Another notification went out to update OIM contact information. If you have not yet done this, please do so. (366 Contacts, 240 not Confirmed)
   * We've been contacting site administrators to turn up RSV reporting on all resources. (Of 30 original tickets, 14 remain)
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled release August 28th.

---++ Future Events
   * September Machine Room Move in Bloomington September 19 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG. This could be delayed until October 17th if it benefits anyone in the collaboration, the original date was picked with the idea of a October LCH turn up.
