---+++ Release schedule
   * Production Change window for January 24th
      * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-24th.html][Change Log]]
      * Hardware moves - We are physically separating the Production Machines from the ITB Machines. All ITB equipment will be moved to a new rack during the maintenance window. 
      * Installation of the new OSG-XSEDE hardware. 
      * Due to the amount of work and time necessarily to move these machines, we will postpone the OS Updates until the next window.
