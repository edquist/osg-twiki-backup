1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:
      * !NanoHUB is running better.  Zero errors, but most jobs are sitting idle.
      * Still not seeing Brookhaven with accepting his jobs, but that's because of ATLAS.
      * Suggested to look at UERJ for a place to run jobs.

2) VDT mailing lists HAVE changed to the opensciencegrid.org domain as of Friday, September 29
   * vdt-support and vdt-discuss affected
   * old lists at ivdgl.org domain will still exist, but forwarded to new addresses
   * Sites should update this information accordingly


---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG usage spotlight on GADU

2) STAR and ATLAS VOMS URL changes (_ticket 2567_)
   * the old URL redirects to the new one.

3) BNL is having a cyber security stand-down on Tuesday, Oct. 3
   * The impact on grid and Internet connections to the lab is unclear, and the length of the stand-down is also unclear.

4) New VO Package with CompBioGrid and ATLAS VOMS Updates on Wednesday
