---++ RSV Periodic Reporting Formats

The following describes the fields requested for daily reporting for RSV.

---+++ Daily Report

Delivered 7AM EDT to osg-status@opensciencegrid.org

%TABLE{tableborder="2"}%

For Compute Elements

| Resource Name | Daily Availbility % | % Diff From Previous Period | Daily Reliability % | Version | CE Permissions | CRL | GridFTP |

For Storage Elements 

%TABLE{tableborder="2"}%

| Resource Name | Daily Availability % | % Diff from Previous Period | Daily Reliability % | SRM Ping | SRM Copy |

---+++ Weekly Report

Delivered Monday Mornings to osg-facility@opensciencegrid.org. Compute and Storage Resources can be listed in the same report.

%TABLE{tableborder="2"}%
| Resource Name | Weekly Availability % | % Availability Diff From Previous Period | Weekly Reliability % | % Reliability Diff From Previous Period |

---+++ Monthly Report

Delivered on the 1st of each month to osg-facility@opensciencegrid.org. Compute and Storage Resources can be listed in the same report.

%TABLE{tableborder="2"}%
| Resource Name | Monthly Availability % | % Availability Diff From Previous Period | Monthly Reliability % | % Reliability Diff From Previous Period |

---+++ Color Scheme

The WLCG Uses the following color scheme for their monthly reporting.

%TABLE{tableborder="2"}%
| % Availability | Color |
| Greater Than 90 | Green |
| Greater Than 60 Less Than 90 | Yellow | 
| Greater Than 30 Less Than 60 | Orange | 
| Less Than 30 | Red |


---+++ Misc suggestions to Brian:

   * Perhaps you could potentially add the "resources not reporting to RSV" to the table with a note like "0% availability -- not reporting RSV"
   * You could flag the interop monitoring resources with a star or a different color in the "name" column
