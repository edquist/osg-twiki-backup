#OperationsMeetings
---++ Operations Weekly Meetings </h3>

   * *nanoHUB Report* New problem at Vanderbilt. Load averages are over 80. It is unknown why. They're holding jobs until this is resolved. Jobs began running again at Buffalo/GRASE. PSU jobs are running well. 
   * Dina from GADU talked briefly about their large job run. Many of the jobs had been completed. More jobs were to be submitted on Tuesday that were expected to take 5-6 days to complete.
   * Rob is assisting Clemson with joining OSG.
   * A discussion of deprecating the use of vanilla grid-proxy certificates and only use voms-proxy certs in OSG brought up several questions. Dan Yocum, who proposed the issue, was not in attendance. The following issues were to be discussed at the next ET meeting.
      * Why require everyone in OSG to use voms-proxy? 
      * What are the benefits? 
      * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers being down or frequently crashing--wouldn't this be a large problem with using voms-proxy? Steven Timm said that this problem is the same as it is now. 
      * And how do you propose everyone be required to use voms-proxy if they're not using SAZ? 
      * Would the change be scalable?
   * Web site running a honeypot to capture passwords for people who typo .edu as .eu -- http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=1866&rss
   * Marist registration reviewed.
   * November 27, Operations meeting usage spotlight on GRASE
