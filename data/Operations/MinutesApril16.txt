---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesApril9][previous meeting]]

1) VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS had been dropping the entire list of supported sites from the database for some VOs. Fixed as of last Monday.

2) A reminder that 0.4.x sites should be installing CEmon and Gratia.
   * Note: Operations only supports the two most recent software releases. The following links will help you install these packages on your 0.4.x installation.
   * CEMon Installation: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/CEMonAndGIPInstallationNotes
   * Gratia Installation: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/ProbeInstallation

 
---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) DZero Production Run Update

Is the Resource selector running? 6 million events per day now...two times DZero's goal! {lanning to continue run until the middle or end of May. 250 million events remaining. Some sites are varied in the amount of jobs they allow DZero run. From one day to the next some sites may cut the run by a large percentage, so they're trying to understand the causes.

2) OSG sites upgraded to 0.6.0

   * ASGC_OSG
   * FNAL_FERMIGRID
   * FNAL_GPFARM
   * GRASE-CCR-U2
   * GROW-PROD
   * NERSC-PDSF
   * OSG_LIGO_PSU
   * STAR-BNL
   * STAR-WSU
   * TTU-ANTAEUS
   * UCR-HEP
   * HEPGRID_UERJ
   * UWMilwaukee
   * Vanderbilt
   * Lehigh_coral
   * CIT_CMS_T2 *new*
   * USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE *new*

3) Streamlining maintenance information

Burt brought up that administrators have a lot of places to announce site maintenance. An enhancement has been requested to limit this number by registering email addresses in the OSG maintenance tool so that it sends email to those addresses. Ongoing development of the tool is part of a larger project that ties into updates to the registration database and the next release is estimated to be the end of July.

4) Engagement is looking for 1000-1500 job slots for running the current application.

   * Review the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS information
   * Review information from Chris Greens VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo testing http://home.fnal.gov/%7Egreenc/site_tests/Engage_latest/
   * Problems Mats is encountering http://www.renci.org/~rynge/osg/
   * List of certified sites   http://haw.renci.org/~rynge/condor_grid_overview.txt

A limited number of sites are supporting the Engage VO. USCMS has suggested that it will host the Engage VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo jobs, so they can try to gain job slots at USCMS. The GOC will send out another email to the Support Centers requesting support of the VO. Issues were discussed regarding the use of home directories for storing large files when $APP and $DATA are preferred for storing these large files. 


5) OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo migration from indiana.edu to voms.opensciencegrid.org located at Fermilab

Chander is the new OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrator. Commercial entities that are interested in being involved in the OSG are going to be managed through the OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo now hosted at Fermilab. The OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo will continue to also be hosted at IU for now.
