---++ Registration Overview

The registration is needed so that OSG Operations has appropriate contact information
for the resources, VOs and support centers participating in OSG along with pointing out 
the relevent OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=86&extension=pdf][user AUP]]
 and [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=87&extension=pdf][service agreement]]
 that apply to all OSG participants.

It is helpful to be familiar with the OSG operations support model described in Operations Model 
Roadmap [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=47][document]].
There are two key aspects of the operations model
   1. it states that every resource, service and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo participating in OSG must have an identified Support Center that handles OSG trouble tickets for those resources, services or VOs, and
   2. end user support is provided by their VO, i.e., by the support center that their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo has identified as handling the user support issues

The descriptions below apply to the three types of registration forms for resource or service, VO,
and Support Center.  Please note that you need a valid DOEGrids Certificate and you need to have that
DOEGrids Certificate loaded in your web browser to enter information 
into these forms, this was a necessary update due to an excessive number of invalid registrations.
If you are registering a new VO, or if your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is not currently listed in the OSG Registration Authority
 pages then please use the OSG VO, to apply for a valid DOEGrids Certificate. More information about the OSG
RA and the process of obtaining a certificate is found at the following URLs:
