%ATTACHURL%/Vo-reg.jpg

---++ Process
---+++1. VO Registration form submitted
Registration info is automatically entered into registration database and marked as not yet accepted.
---+++2. Spam check
	* OSG Ops looks at info to see if it sensible. 
	* If it is irrational then the record is deleted and no further action is taken.
	* If it is reasonable looking but incomplete then OSG Ops enters email exchange with submitter to verify or correct the information.
---+++3. Is VO already registered?
	* If the VO was already registered then the updated information is checked to see if an update to the VO module pacman cache is required.
		* If a VO module update is not required then no further action is required.
		* [How do we know if the VO was already registered, other than memory? Is there a database field to indicate that?]
	* If VO module update is required then a ticket is created about it for review at the next weekly Ops meeting.
