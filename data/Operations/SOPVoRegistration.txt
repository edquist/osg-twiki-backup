%ATTACHURL%/Vo-reg.jpg

---++ Process
---+++1. VO Registration form submitted
Registration info is automatically entered into registration database and marked as not yet accepted.
---+++2. Spam check
	* OSG Ops looks at info to see if it sensible. 
	* If it is irrational then the record is deleted and no further action is taken.
	* If it is reasonable looking but incomplete then OSG Ops enters email exchange with submitter to verify or correct the information.
---+++3. Is VO already registered?
	* If the VO was already registered then check to see what fields are udpated.
		* If a VO module update is required then create ticket for VO update.
		* Check if any contact information for Footprints ticket system or security contact has changed then add this to VO update ticket, or create new ticket.
		* [How do we know if the VO was already registered, other than memory? Is there a database field to indicate that?]
		* If no fields that require propagation are updated then no further action is required.
	* If VO is not already registered then create new VO registration ticket and do Step 4.
---+++4. Is VO already member of OSG?
	* [How do we tell if a VO is:]
		* [already a member of OSG?]
		* [automatically a member of OSG by relation to consortium member?]
	* If in doubt, send question to IEB, and create ticket to track it.
	* If not in doubt, send notification of VO registration to IEB.

---+++5. Process VO Tickets
	* new VO registration ticket
		* verify information in registration database for this VO
			* valid support center, functioning URLs, valid email addresses
		* mark ticket as ready for review at Ops meeting
	* VO update ticket
		* identify all updated fields
		* propagate any updated contact information to Footprints and security databases [any others?]
		* if changes require update to VO module then mark this ticket as ready for review at Ops meeting

---+++6. Operations Meeting ticket review
	* new VO ticket
		* did IEB comment on new VO validity? ticket is defered if IEB questioned or denied the VO registration
			* IEB notification needs to be 2 business days before operations meeting, i.e., send notice to IEB on or before Thursday for a Monday operations meeting.  If less time has elapsed then ticket should be defered until the next operations meeting.
		* is ticket accepted at operations review?
			* if yes, then proceed to propagate contact info and update VO module
			* if not, then return ticket to process to fix it
	* VO update ticket
		* does updated information cause a VO module update?
			* if yes, then proceed to update VO module
		* propagate any contact info changes

---+++7. Update VO Module
	* make changes to pacman cache for new and/or updated VO information
	* test changes somehow
	* send notification of updated VO module to all Support Centers [what list, or individually?]
		* notice should include release notes about changes
