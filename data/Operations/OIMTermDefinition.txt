%TOC%

NOTE: The OSG Blueprint Document is available at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18

---+++ Facility
   * The OSG Blueprint Document defines a facility as "A collection of Sites under a single administrative domain." 
   * OIM Uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: Indiana University, Fermi National Accelarator Laboratory 

---+++ Site
   * The OSG Blueprint Document defines a site as "A named collection of Services, Providers and Resources for administrative purposes." 
   * OIM uses the same definition (referred to as "Administrative Sites")
   * Examples: UCSD CMS T2, ATLAS SWT2 OU, STAR Brookhaven 

---+++ Resource Group
   * This term is not defined in the OSG Blueprint document
   * A resource group is a logical grouping of various resource-service mappings within a site. For example, the IU_Physics site in the Indiana University facility could group 4 gatekeepers and 1 SRM SE under one resource_group called IU_Physics_1

---+++ Resource
   * The OSG Blueprint Document defines a resource as "A source of supply, support, or aid, esp. one that can be readily drawn upon when needed." 
   * In OIM a resource constitutes a grid resource provided to the OSG community. These resources will provide services in the form of Compute Elements, Storage Elements (SRM V1, SRM V2, Bestman/XrootD, or GSIFTP) , Central Infrastructure Services, or Site Level Infrastructure Services. 
   * Examples: BU_ATLAS_Tier2, CIT_CMS_T2, UFlorida-IHEPA 

---+++ Service
   * In OIM a service runs on a resource to let grid users run jobs. Compute Elements, Storage Elements (SRM V1, SRM V2, Bestman/XrootD, or GSIFTP) , Central Infrastructure Services, or Site Level Infrastructure are examples services. 
   * [[OIMServiceList][List]] of possible OIM Services grouped by Service Group.


---+++ Virtual Site
   * The OSG Blueprint Document defines a Virtual Site as "A set of sites that agree to use the same policies in order to act as an administrative unit. Sites and Facilities negotiate a common administrative context to form a "virtual&rdquo; site or facility." 
   * OIM uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: MWT2 

---+++ Support Center
   * OSG defines a Support Center as a contact or group of contacts that provide support for a resource's or virtual organization's user community. 
   * OIM uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: USCMS Support Center, Community Support Center 

---+++ Virtual Organization
   * The OSG Blueprint Document defines a Virtual Organization as "A dynamic collection of Users, Resources and Services for sharing of Resources (Globus definition). A VO is party to contracts between Resource Providers & VOs which govern resource usage & policies. A subVO is a sub-set of the Users and Services within a VO which operates under the contracts of the parent." 
   * OIM uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: USATLAS, SBGrid, LIGO 

---+++ Contact
   * OIM defines contact as an individual or group responsible for addressing queries regarding OSG resources or virtual organizations. Possible contacts include Operations, Security, and Management. 
   * Example: Gratia Ops Group (for Gratia Operations Contact), Rob Quick (for GOC Operations Contact and for the IUPUI-ITB Resource Operations and Security Contact)
