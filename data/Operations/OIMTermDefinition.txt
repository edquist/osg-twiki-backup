---++ About This Document
This document defines some basic terms and concepts used in the OSG Information Management (OIM) Project.


%STARTINCLUDE%
---+ Definition of Terms as used in the OSG Information Management (OIM) Project
OIM defines the topology used by various OSG systems and services; it is based on the OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document available at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18. For example, !MyOSG, BDII, Gratia all use topology defined in OIM.

   * [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu]] -- Requires user to be register an X509 certificate issued by an [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/cadist/][OSG approved Certifying Authority (CA)]] via their web browser.

---++ Terms

---+++ Facility
   * The OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document defines a facility as "A collection of Sites under a single administrative domain." 
   * OIM Uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: Indiana University, Fermi National Accelarator Laboratory 

---+++ Site
   * The OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document defines a site as "A named collection of Services, Providers and Resources for administrative purposes." 
   * OIM uses the same definition (referred to as "Administrative Sites")
   * Examples: UCSD CMS T2, ATLAS SWT2 OU, STAR Brookhaven 

---+++ Resource Group
   * This term is not defined in the OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint document
   * A resource group is a logical grouping of various resource-service mappings within a site. For example, the IU_Physics site in the Indiana University facility could group 4 gatekeepers and 1 SRM SE under one resource_group called IU_Physics_1

---+++ Resource
   * The OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document defines a resource as "A source of supply, support, or aid, esp. one that can be readily drawn upon when needed." 
   * In OIM a resource constitutes a grid resource provided to the OSG community. These resources will provide services in the form of Compute Elements, Storage Elements (SRM V1, SRM V2, Bestman/XrootD, or GSIFTP) , Central Infrastructure Services, or Site Level Infrastructure Services. 
   * Examples: BU_ATLAS_Tier2, CIT_CMS_T2, UFlorida-IHEPA 

---+++ Service
   * In OIM a service runs on a resource to let grid users run jobs. Compute Elements, Storage Elements (SRM V1, SRM V2, Bestman/XrootD, or GSIFTP) , Central Infrastructure Services, or Site Level Infrastructure are examples services. 
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/misccount/index?datasource=count&count_total=on&count_sg_501=on&count_sg_101=on&count_sg_1=on&count_sg_201=on&count_sg_1000=on&count_sg_301=on&count_sg_401=on][List]] of possible OIM Services grouped by Service Group.


---+++ Virtual Site
   * The OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document defines a Virtual Site as "A set of sites that agree to use the same policies in order to act as an administrative unit. Sites and Facilities negotiate a common administrative context to form a "virtual&rdquo; site or facility." 
   * OIM uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: MWT2 

---+++ Support Center (SC)
   * OSG defines a Support Center as a contact or group of contacts that provide support for a resource's or virtual organization's user community. 
   * OIM uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: USCMS Support Center, Community Support Center 

---+++ Virtual Organization (VO)
   * The OSG Trash/Trash/Blueprint Document defines a Virtual Organization as "A dynamic collection of Users, Resources and Services for sharing of Resources (Globus definition). A VO is party to contracts between Resource Providers & VOs which govern resource usage & policies. A subVO is a sub-set of the Users and Services within a VO which operates under the contracts of the parent." 
   * OIM uses the same definition. 
   * Examples: USATLAS, SBGrid, LIGO 

---+++ Contact
   * OIM defines contact as an individual or group responsible for addressing queries regarding OSG resources or virtual organizations or support centers. Contact types are explained below - most contact types allow one primary and one secondary contact for that type, and some allow multiple tertiary contacts.
   * *Support Center Contacts* 
      * Operations contact (Ticketing) - [[http://ticket.grid.iu.edu/][GOC tickets]] when assigned to a support center are sent to the primary Operations contact's email address for that SC.
      * Notifications contact - GOC notifications ([[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/][also available via RSS]]) are sent to both primary and secondary notification contacts for an SC
      * Security contact - Security notifications sent out by the OSG security team are sent to primary and secondary security contacts for a SC if the notification is relevant to resources or VOs that SC may support.
      * Miscellaneous contact - Contacts who do not fall under any of the above types but would like to be able to edit a support center can be added as miscellaneous contact
   * *Resource Contacts* 
      * Administrative contact - [[http://ticket.grid.iu.edu/][GOC tickets]] when assigned to a support center of a resource are also sent to the primary resource admin contact (usually the sysadmin of a resource) via the ticket's CC mechanism. Admin contacts are also contacted by GOC staff and others to deal with system-administrative problems.
      * Reporting contact - Gratia-accounting based resource-usage reports are sent out daily/weekly to one or more contacts listed as report contacts for a resource.
      * Security contact - Security notifications sent out by the OSG security team are sent to primary and secondary security contacts for a resource if the notification is relevant to that or all resource(s).
      * Miscellaneous contact - Contacts who do not fall under any of the above types but would like to be able to edit a resource can be added as miscellaneous contact
   * *VO Contacts* 
      * Manager contact - VO Managers usually make decisions on what VOs are allowed to run on their VO-owned resources, who are users of a VO, etc.
      * Administrative contact -- A primary contact for ticketing and assorted issues. This is typically a user/application support person or a help desk.
      * Security contact - Security notifications sent out by the OSG security team are sent to primary and secondary security contacts for a VO if the notification is relevant to a VO or its applications and/or users.
      * Miscellaneous contact - Contacts who do not fall under any of the above types but would like to be able to edit a VO can be added as miscellaneous contact
   * Example: Gratia Ops Group is Operations Contact for <em>Gratia</em> SC; Rob Quick is Operations Contact for the <em>OSG-GOC SC</em> and {Admin, Security} contact for the <em>IUPUI-ITB</em> resource.
