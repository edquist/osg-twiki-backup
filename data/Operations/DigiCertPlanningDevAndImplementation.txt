---++ Objective

The goal of this activity is to develop and deploy a new OSG CA, and transition  the OSG user community from the DOE Grids CA to that new CA. The timeline is composed of discrete phases: Planning, Development, Deployment, Transition and Operations. A Pilot phase has already been completed.

%ATTACHURL%/CA-timeline.png

---++ Planning

The planning phase should commence as soon as possible with the goal of completing by the end of April, 2012. The goals of the planning phase (and their proposed owners) are:
   * (Jeremy and Soichi) Develop a technical plan, timeline and acceptance test plan for development and deployment of the OSG CA front-end web service and supported clients (e.g. certificate request scripts). This plan needs to take into account:
      * OSG’s audit, accounting, and access control requirements.
      * Acceptance testing should consider Integration TestBed (ITB) of certificate from the new OSG CA.
      * What client software needs to be modified, who will do it, and what support they need.
      * Meeting notes from 3/1 meeting: Security.March12012PKIMeetingNotes
      * Design must be written up and approved by Alain Roy and his team
   * (Mine) Develop a training plan for OSG Registration Authorities and GridAdmins.
      * Von will handle an initial one-hour presentation at the OSG All Hands Meeting in March, 2012.
   * (Ruth) Develop a communications plan for OSG users.
   * (Von) Develop a plan for how OSG and DigiCert will interact, in terms of technical issues (REST API changes), user support issue resolution, and business processes.
   * (Jim Basney) Develop a plan for handling the change in user’s distinguished names that results from a change in CA .
      * Underway: Security.DOEGrids2DigiCertDNTransition
   * (Von) Understand the impact of the change in CRL lifetime from the DOE Grids PKI (1 month) to DigiCert CA (1 week) will have on the OSG and develop a plan to cope with that change.
      * CRLChangeImpact
   * (TBD) Define the administrative operational services (monitoring, alarming) to be developed and deployed for operation of the OSG CA.
   * (Jim Basney) Monitor [[Security.XsedeCA][XSEDE CA]] progress and look for synergies.
   * (Rob Q.) Document what operational changes will come about from the CA transition and plan for addressing those changes.
   * (Mine and Keith) Document what policy and contingency plan changes need to be made and develop a plan for addressing those changes. See Appendix A in the Implementation Plan for a list of known issues to be addressed in the Contingency plan.
   * (TBD) Document any users of OSG that are currently using the DOE Grids CA whom should be transitioned to another CA, and develop a plan for transitioning those users. E.g., users outside the U.S.
   * (Ruth and Von) Develop a transition plan with a list of users (both current OSG users and other identified DOE Grids user communities) who should be invited to try out the new OSG CA and a timeline for their invitation.
      * Von has started a document.
   * (Von, Jim, Alain D.) Figure out how were going to get all the [[Security.OsgRaAgents][OSG RA Agents]] vetted as DigiCert RA's.
   * (Chander) Develop a project plan for the all these activities. This should include a detailed timeline for the Development, Transition phases and Operations phases.
   * (Von) Complete the execution of legal and policy agreements with DigiCert started during the Pilot phase.
      * DigiCertAgreements
   * (Von) Identity and document OtherOSGPKIUseCases

---++ Development
The development phase should commence as soon as planning is sufficiently complete. The length of this phase will be determined by the Planning phase. The goals of this phase are:
   * Develop the OSG CA web service front-end and integrate with the DigiCert CA through the REST API and have that front-end pass acceptance testing as defined in the Planning Phase.
   * Commence work on operational, policy, contingency plan and other changes defined in the Planning phase.


---++ Deployment
The Deployment phase should commence as soon development of the CA web service front-end is complete. The goals of this phase are:
   * Deploy the CA web front-end in conjunction with the DigiCert CA such that it is available for the start of Transition.
   * Complete work on operational, policy, contingency plan and other changes defined in the Planning phase.

---++ Transition

The goals of this phase are:
   * Transition, gradually, all OSG users and other identified DOE Grids user communities from using the DOE Grids CA to the new OSG CA. 
   * Correct usability and other flaws as exposed.
   * Perform a test of contingency plans and address exposed flaws.
   * Have an external review of contingency plans performed.

---++ Operations

The goal of this phase is the continued operation of the new OSG CA. Once this phase is reached, the OSG will not long require certificate issuance from the DOE Grids CA. OSG will require a one-year period where the DOE Grids CA continues to issue CRLs and then will have no dependencies on the DOE Grids CA.
