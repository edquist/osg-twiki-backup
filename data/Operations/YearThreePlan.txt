---+ Operations Year Three Plan

---+++ Introduction and Purpose

The primary goals of the OSG Operations group are the preservation and strengthening the autonomy of OSG resources, building operational relationships with peering grids, providing reliable grid infrastructure services, insuring timely action and tracking of operational issues, and responding quickly and accurately to security incidents.

After a successful year two of the OSG Operations group, we are looking to continue to provide outstanding operational service to the OSG, while evolving a complete set of operational tools based on the year 2 releases. The GOC continued it excellent recond of providing stable critical services and providing community support. If anything this will be more important in the coming year with the LHC turn up and the increased usage of OSG. The OIM database was release in May of 2008 and provides a tool for administrative information as well as providing scheduled maintenance data, this is the base of all current and future operational tools developed at the GOC. The RSV project has moved monitoring forward by providing standard probes to gather status and metrics data. This will be an overarching document that explains the goals and expectation of the coming year three for the Operations Group. Several sub-plan will be written to further explain major areas of effort and will be linked in the document below.

---++ Support LHC Experiments During Turn Up

One of the biggest events for OSG during the upcoming year will be the increased activity of the USATLAS and USCMS VOs associated with the turn up of the LHC. The GOC has several items to accomplish associated with the increased volume of support issues and usage of core services.

---+++ Publish Data to WLCG Systems

---++++ Achieve Full Equivalency to WLCG Standards

The current set of RSV probes is incomplete in establishing full equivelency to the WLCG set of tests. There have been two probes identified as needing to be added before this is accomplished.
   * Worker node job test - A test that runs on and returns data from the worker node it runs on. 
   * BDII Test - Determins if the resource is publishing sensible data to the GOC BDII. 

---++++ Create Policy for Data Transfer and Updates to the SAM and Grid View
 This will take defining the current policy for data delivery and expectations from the WLCG for OSG. A MOU between the GOC and SAM developers should be agreed upon defining change management procedures and notification expectation.

---+++ Participate in Continued Evolution of Tool Specifications (As started with the Grid Monitoring Working Group)
 The GOC has led the way in implementing the specifications agreed to in the [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/GridServiceMonitoringInfo][Grid Monitoring Working Group]]. Members will continue to participate and lead discussions on how to implement these specifications in other WLCG partner grids, along with ways to improve on the current specifications.

---+++ Continue Coordinating Interactions with WLCG Operations

The GOC communicates and works with the WLCG Operations group in several ways. These will be continued in year three.
   * Trouble ticket exchange and working until resolution 
   * Weekly OSG Operations Phone Meetings 
   * Face to Face Operations Meetings 

---++++ Testing and Update of Ticket Exchange with WLCG Partners
 Testing should be completed of all ticket exchange mechanisms, updates will be provided where necessary. This testing will include the USATLAS, USCMS, and GGUS ticket exchanges.

---++ Maintain Service Quality

One major strenght of the GOC is the ability to run reliabe, stable core OSG and GOC services.

---+++ Operations of Critical OSG Services

We currently run 14 core OSG services and several more for the GOC. These include monitoring, administrative, and utility services that are critical to the operations of the OSG and our ability to provide those services. A development instance is run for many of these services to allow upgrades during an integration phase of the service. Service not running a development instance will be set up to do so during year three. Virtual machine technology will be used to implemet these development service.

---++++ Core Services

Core services represent tools that are critical for job to run properly on the OSG, or for getting status information about the OSG. A list of the core services follows:
   * BDII/CEMon Aggregator 
   * RSV Collector 
   * VORS 
   * GOC VOMS/GUMS 
   * OSG Software Cache 
   * VOMS Monitor 
   * GIP Validator 
   * MonALISA (Deprecated) 

---++++ Operation Support Services

Operations support services provide infrastructure support mechanisms for the OSG and GOC.
   * OIM 
   * Footprints 
   * TWiki 
   * Trouble Ticket Exchanges 
   * Notification Tools 

---++++ Communication Services

Communication services allow the OSG to communicate internally and externally.
   * Reporting Services for Core and Support Services 
   * 24x7 Phone, Email, Web Support for Ticketing 
   * Weekly Operations Phone Call 
   * OSG RSS News Feed 

---+++ Ticket Tracking and Resolution

Year one and two ticketing metrics are located [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/reports/ticketreports.html][here]] for review.

Ticket tracking and working through to resolution is another of the GOCs major strengths. However, a more standardized policy is needed to set the proper expectations for ticketing with the increased load that will come with additional activity in the OSG. This document will put forth expectations for opening, transfer of information, how to deal with updates, time scales for closing inactive tickets, escalation rules and procedures, and resolution rules.

An outline for this document can be found [[TicketingPolicy][here]].

---+++ Incident Response and After Hours Support

The GOC will continue to provide security incident response as in prior years. Working closely with the OSG Security Officer, notification to the OSG community with potential issues will be quickly and accurately distributed.

After hours support for critical OSG infrastructure services and security incidents is set forth in the document located [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=534][here]]. %RED%(This document contains contact informaiton and may not be viewable to non-OSG staff.) %ENDCOLOR%
