---+ Operations Year Three Plan

---+++ Introduction and Purpose

The primary goals of the OSG Operations group are the preservation and strengthening the autonomy of OSG resources, building operational relationships with peering grids, providing reliable grid infrastructure services, insuring timely action and tracking of operational issues, and responding quickly and accurately to security incidents.

After a successful year two of the OSG Operations group, we are looking to continue to provide outstanding operational service to the OSG, while evolving a complete set of operational tools based on the year 2 releases. The GOC continued it excellent recond of providing stable critical services and providing community support. If anything this will be more important in the coming year with the LHC turn up and the increased usage of OSG. The OIM database was release in May of 2008 and provides a tool for administrative information as well as providing scheduled maintenance data, this is the base of all current and future operational tools developed at the GOC. The RSV project has moved monitoring forward by providing standard probes to gather status and metrics data. This will be an overarching document that explains the goals and expectation of the coming year three for the Operations Group. Several sub-plan will be written to further explain major areas of effort and will be linked in the document below.
