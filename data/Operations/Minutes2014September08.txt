---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

We are seeing our gatekeepers occasionally hit 100% cpu usage.  This may be tickling some bug in gridftp.  DES seeing 1 in 10,000 gridftp processes hanging.

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

We will probably increase cpus on our gatekeepers this week.  Looking to see if we can move some things around to free up the resources.  Would be quick reboot of gatekeeper nodes.
