As part of our transition plan, we are decommissioning the existing server voms.fnal.gov and have replaced its functionality with 2 new VOMS servers (voms1.fnal.gov and voms2.fnal.gov) with Digicert certificates. 
They have passed our internal testing and are ready to be used by wider user community.
