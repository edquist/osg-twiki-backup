---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesFebruary19][previous meeting]]

1) DZero Production Run Update
   * Parag, are the USCMS jobs running?

5-7 mailing events per day now. Some issues have been uncovered and efficiency isn't as good as they'd like. Half the problems are OSG issues and half appear to be SAMS. NERSC and Indiana sites are problematic, but Fred, speaking on behalf of the IU sites, said that DZero should get a fraction of their jobs running there. Efficiency rate at this point is 50%. Tickets should be opened with the GOC concerning any site issues.

2) Update from Engage, GROW and DZero VOs regarding requests for increased support

Eric sent a link to Rob sharing the GROW information. Out of a three-day run they got 1500 days worth of CPUs, which is very good. The logs from the last few runs were not kept for comparisons, but several new sites are supporting them. NWICG (Notre Dame) asked about successful jobs running there and Eric will get back to them with those statistics.
 
---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on mariachi

Cosmic rays of high ionization (review). Funding comes from science education and cyberinfrastructure funding. 8 CPU 4node cluster and a VOMS server up and running. OSG CE is in the process of getting online and they have a GUMS server running. They're using OSG from application certificates. By next year they could be submitting and accepting jobs from OSG.

2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus

   * *Last Week*: The last few jobs are running: Purdue, Chicago and Vanderbilt. Having trouble with some jobs where files won't return the data back to nanoHUB. There are no errors with any substantial error codes. Jaime Frey with the Condor team has filed a ticket with Globus on the issue.

   * *This Week*: No change from last week. Steve wants the GOC to push for a response from Jaime.

      * A PASS or FAIL was requested to be added to the top of the service details page when clicking on the site's name.
      * All the storage elements are blue on the map because we haven't yet determined the critical tests for SE's.
