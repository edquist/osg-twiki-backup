---+++ Overview

A content management system (CMS) is a system providing a collection of 
procedures used to manage work flow in a collaborative environment. These 
procedures can be manual or computer-based. The procedures are designed to 
do the following:

   * Allow for a large number of people to share and contribute to stored data;
   * Control access to data based on user role (i.e., define information users or user groups can view, edit, publish, etc.);
   * Facilitate storage and retrieval of data;
   * Control data validity and compliance;
   * Reduce duplicate inputs;
   * Improve communication among users.
(Extracted from [1])

---+++ Scale of the current problem

OSG wishes to consolidate its various web available information services under a single management umbrella. The services being considered are
   * TWiki, several thousand pages
   * www.opensciencegrid.org, of order 100 pages
   * DocDb, about 2000 files


---+++ Possible solutions

   Reference [2] lists 1217 content management systems, as  of this writing. Clearly, a detailed evaluation of each of these is impossible. Therefore, a procedure to identify candidate systems must be developed ( _Selection of candidates_ below) . When a set of candidates is identified a set of criteria for determining their suitability for this use must be established ( _Constraints_ ). After The initial candidate list has been narrowed to suitable candidates a small number must be selected, most likely by subjective methods for further evaluation.
 
---+++ Constraints

CMSs have a widely variable sets of features. Some features are required for a system to suitable to this purpose, others are desirable but not required and some irrelevant. Any candidate CMS must have the essential features or it should not be considered further. The first step of this plan is to identify these features or constraints so as to prune the decision tree to a manageable size. Below are listed some constraints arranged by category. This list is not intended to be necessary or complete but serves as a starting point for discussion. The language for the features is taken from reference [2].
 
   A. Absolute, constraints which, if unsatisfied, _define_ the CMS as unsuitable.
      i. Document Approval
      i. Document management (if DocDb to be included)
      i. Granular Privileges
      i. Extensible user profiles
      i. SSL compatible
      i. Version control
      i. Wiki
      i. Others
   A. Preferred, features that add additional desirability to the system but are not _required_
      i. Open source/Minimal cost otherwise
      i. Site Map
      i. Conversion tools (TikiWiki, for example, can convert TWiki pages)
      i. SSL logins and pages 
      i. Others
   A. Desired, features which add additional capability to the OSG web presence or enhance usability.
      i. WYSIWYG editor
      i. Others

---+++ Identify candidates

Clearly, 1200+ candidate systems is unmanageable. A significantly smaller (perhaps 10) number must be identified for further consideration. Some methods 

---++++ User survey

User satisfaction should always be a guiding principle in a service oriented effort. Requesting input from the OSG community would be a powerful technique to identify candidate CMSs and should not be dismissed out of hand.

---++++ Other similar organizations

Large Universities, National Labs, XSEDE and EGI have requirements similar to OSG. Their choices should be considered candidate systems unless they can
be eliminated by previously identified constraints. The simple fact that XSEDE chose  _LifeRay_ indicates thtat system should be considered.

---++++ Technical means

Many CMS comparison sites exist, some with systems rated by preference. [3-5]. Using ratings generated by other authors exposes this process to the bias of those authors. However, surveys with a large population of respondents exist and this mitigates the exposure to bias. For example, [3] rates Drupal in the top ten overall with over 19,000 respondents providing a rating. Selection of "top rated" sites with the additional requirement that more than some number of responses (2,000 was used in this example) couls also be a selector.
