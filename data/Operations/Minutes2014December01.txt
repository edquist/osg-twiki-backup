---++ Operations This Week

---++++ Grid Operations Center
   * ITB week, expect notification tomorrow afternoon
      * OIM: changes in access permissions associated with oasis

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

   * Will be adding 30 worker nodes to GP farm this week (64 cores each).  No one should notice.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory

---++++ OSG-Connect
   * Report stash is down.
      * stash and login.osgconnect.net were both rebooted (details not yet known; should have more info tomorrow)
      * after a reboot stash does not mount automatically on login, nor start http and globus services automatically, due to a messy dependency relationship at bootstrap
      * made some changes today to defer stash mounts via automounter; hope this will skirt the dependency chain and allow everything to start automatically
      * system is functioning again (as of ~2pm Eastern) and we will monitor during next reboot to see that dependencies are working well
