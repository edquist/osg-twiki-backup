Attendees: 

   * 12:00pm Central
   * Phone Number 510-665-5437 Meeting ID 786999

---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesFebruary5][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on mariachi

2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus

   * *Last week*: Still having issues at UNM because of the time discrepancy between Condor (minutes) and PBS (a different format). Requested time is 880 minutes, but was being treated as something like 880 hours. Two jobs have given an error of not having enough disk space, but that shouldn't be the actual issue. Seven jobs at Purdue, four having problems. And a few jobs at Venderbilt with trouble running internal script argument files, which he has contacted them about.

3) DZero Production Run

4) Request for increased support of Engage and GROW
