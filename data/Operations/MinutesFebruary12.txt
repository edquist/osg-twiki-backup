   * *Last week*: Still having issues at UNM because of the time discrepancy between Condor (minutes) and PBS (a different format). Requested time is 880 minutes, but was being treated as something like 880 hours. Two jobs have given an error of not having enough disk space, but that shouldn't be the actual issue. Seven jobs at Purdue, four having problems. And a few jobs at Venderbilt with trouble running internal script argument files, which he has contacted them about.
