---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesNovember20][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  New problem at Vanderbilt. Load averages are over 80. It is unknown why. They're holding jobs until this is resolved. Nothing has changed in Steve's code, so he's not sure why this problem cropped up. On another note, there has been no change at Buffalo. Rob didn't get to discuss the issue at SC06, but he will followup this week. PSU jobs are running well. Steve asked Brookhaven to clarify the number of jobs they're running, as reported by GridCat.
