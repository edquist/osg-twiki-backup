---++ Operations This Week
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/08/myosg-16-release-notice.html][release on September 1st]]. 
   * September 1, from 9pm - 10pm EDT, the GOC Ticketing system will be down for Footprints server maintenance.

---++ Future Events
   * Labor Day Holiday Next Monday, No Ops Meeting
   * September Machine Room Move in Bloomington September 19 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG. This could be delayed until October 17th if it benefits anyone in the collaboration, the original date was picked with the idea of a October LHC turn up. 
      * ATLAS has confirmed this date is OK
      * Waiting for word from CMS
      * High probability that this will happen on October 17th and not September 19th
