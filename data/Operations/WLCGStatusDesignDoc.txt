---++ About This Document
 The WLCG reports are created from local RSV probes which are reported to the central RSV Collector. These results are based on only the critical probes defined below. OSG resources are defined as Red, Orange, Yellow or Green based on the availability or reliability defined in the table below. The Computation of Service Availability Metrics in Gridview document is also attached for a detailed explanation of the WLCG calculations.

   * Compute Element
      * Ping
      * GRAM Authentication
      * OSG Version
      * CACert Expiry  
      * OSG Directory Permissions
   * Grid FTP
