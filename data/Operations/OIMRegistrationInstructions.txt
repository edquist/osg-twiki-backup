---++ About this Document

OSG often requires users and other collaborators to register some contact information with the Grid Operations Center. There are some situations in which the GOC will need to contact OSG users, such as in matters concerning the OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=86&extension=pdf][acceptable use policy]] and [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=87&extension=pdf][service agreement]] that apply to all OSG participants. A detailed explanation of the different fields and terms for registration follows.

---++ Requirements

Any user who wishes to register in OSG Information Management System (OIM) will need a valid OSG approved Certifying Authority (CA) x509 Certificate. If you have an x509 certificate, but are not sure if OSG trusts the issuer, the list of Certifying Authorities that OSG trusts can be found in the [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/cadist/][CA distribution of the software cache]]. In order for OIM to recognize an x509 certificate, a user must have done one of the following with his or her certificate:

   * loaded it directly in his or her web browser *OR*
   * placed it in a certificate managing software (such as mac keychain) that is compatible with his or her browser.

If you do not have a valid [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/cadist/][OSG approved Certifying Authority (CA)]] x509 Certificate, but you do work with OSG, please submit a certificate request at the [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/][OSG certificate request page]].

---++ Registering Yourself

Before you register information about any OSG service, organization or other entity, you will need to give us some basic contact information about yourself. If you have not already done this, once you arrive at [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OIM]] with your x509 certificate, you will be prompted to register with the following message:

<b>"OIM requires the Distinguished Name (DN) of an X509 certificate issued by an OSG-approved Certifying Authority (CA) to be registered in order to proceed.
The following unregistered DN was detected from your web browser: 
/DC=org/DC=(your Certifying Authority appears here)/OU=People/CN=(your common name appears here)
Please register your certificate's DN with the OIM system using the Register menu item above, so you can be allowed to proceed further.
If you believe, you have previously registered this DN, or are not sure how to register, or have any other questions, please open a ticket with the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC)."</b>

Upon clicking the *Register* button in the top menu, the following message should appear:

<b>"Your certificate DN is not registered on OIM.
To register and gain access to OIM, please register now by submitting following form."</b>

---+++ Required Information
The following information is *required* in the fields on the *Register* form

   * Your Certificate DN - This should be automatically gleaned from your x509 certificate and will appear in the format /DC=org/DC=SomeCA/OU=People/CN=SomeUniqueName
   * Your Full Name - Please enter this in the first-name last-name format, i.e. "John Smith" instead of "Smith, John" or  "John"
   * Your Email Address - This is our primary method of contact if a problem occurs. You will be asked to re-enter your email address for confirmation.
   * Primary Phone - the telephone number where it is easiest to reach you in the event of an emergency or if email contact fails.
   * City - If you work and live in different cities, enter the city where you work.
   * State - If you work and live in different US states, enter the state where you work.
   * Zipcode - If you work and live in different zipcodes, enter the zipcode where you work.
   * Country
   * Time Zone - If you work and live in different time zones,enter the time zone where you work.
   * Profile - Enter a short explanation of your OSG affiliation. Full Bios are accepted if you like.

---+++ Optional Information
The following information is *optional* but helpful. If you do not wish to give certain information here, or it is inapplicable, please leave it blank rather than entering something like "none."

   * Secondary Email - a backup email address if the first becomes unavailable for any reason.
   * Primary Phone Extension - Your private extension, if applicable, for your primary phone.
   * Secondary Phone - a telephone number to use in the event that the primary phone is unavailable.
   * Secondary Phone Extension - Your private extension, if applicable, for your secondary phone.
   * SMS Address - an email address that will trigger a text message to your phone. For example, the number +1 (444) 555-3333 might be 4445553333@vtext.com (for a verizon cell phone), 4445553333@txt.att.net (for an AT&T cell phone) or 4445553333@messaging.sprintpcs.com (for a sprint cell phone). If you would like to participate, you can contact your cellular provider for instructions or simply test whether your SMS address works on your phone by sending yourself a test email. The GOC only uses SMS addresses for critical alerts.
   * Enter Additional Contact Preferences - This is a text area where you can explain to us how you would like your contact information to be used.
   * Address Line 1 - Your street address, such as "112 maple street"
   * Address Line 2 - Your building address or other more detailed coordinates, if applicable, such as "3rd floor" "Research Technology Department" "Room 58" "Apartment 13" "Care of Rita Hayworth" or such items.
   * Instant Messaging Information - This is designed to only be human readable, so you may enter information here in whatever form you like, but be sure to specify your username and the service you are using. If you are using a jabber service, please also include your domain.
      * For example, the following input is acceptable: "aim: OSGdude jabber: osgdude@iupui.edu google: osgdude@gmail.com 2nd jabber (but only for fnal items) osgdude@fnal.gov." 
      * No one will attempt to contact you by this method unless you request it.
   * Use OSG TWiki - Put a checkmark in this checkbox if you wish to create an account for the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu][OSG TWiki]]. The TWiki is OSG's collaborative documentation environment.
   * OSG TWiki ID - This should be a combination of upper and lowercase letters without spaces and generally follows the format !FirstnameLastname, for example Marilyn Monroe would be !MarilynMonroe rather than Marilyn Monroe or marilynmonroe. This will typically be generated automatically, but if there is already a TWiki account listed with your first and last name, this field will be blank, allowing you to either tether your existing TWiki account to your x509 certificate, or to choose a TWiki username if you have never generated an account.

Once you have completed all of the required fields and any optional fields you wish to enter, you may click the "Submit" button and you will be registered and admitted into the OIM System.
