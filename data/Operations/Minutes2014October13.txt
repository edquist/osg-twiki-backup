   * The third Thursday of the month (our scheduled maintenance day) is this week.  The only externally facing service that will be effected is the gratia database.  Nothing will change on the databases actually but the network switch to which the databases are connected have some "stuck" processes per networking and need to be rebooted and updated.  They have asked for 9-10AM but they think it will only take 10 minutes.
   * We will also update some of our internal glideinwms frontends and factories to the latest versions from the OSG repository.
