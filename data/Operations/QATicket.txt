---+ Operations Support: Quality Assurance Procedure

| Version | Author | Notes |
| 0.1 | GOC Support Team | Drat Status. |

---++ Introduction and Goal



---++ Procedure 

   * Two Reports will be generated each day. One in the morning and one in the evening. These reports identify any ticket with a NAD that is over due.

   * Each member of the Operations Support Team and Infrastructure Group will be responsible for review and updating any ticket assigned to them before the end of business each day.

   * Each day/week a member of the Support Team will be assigned the task of QA, defaulting to the support groups manager if no one else is available. This person, with the assistance of anyone else who is available, will at the end of each day ensure that proper action is taken on any ticket that is overdue. If no is needed the ticket will be bumped to the next date for further review.
