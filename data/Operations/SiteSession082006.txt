---+   OSG Consortium Meeting:  Parallel Session: Site and Fabric Installation and Configuration

---++  Goals
   *  Develop site and fabric requirements to be delivered to the OSG Executive team.  Working list in SiteFabricRequirements
   * Review current best practices for site and fabric deployment, collected in SiteFabricBestPractices
   *  Review current documentation list, identify what may be missing.  (Particular focus on issues which until now have been considered "out of scope" of the OSG CE Installation guide).  See SiteFabricDocumentationTable for documents identified thus far.
   *  Develop a work plan to create and improve the documentation set which is provided by the Integration activity.   Draft plan is in SiteFabricDocumentationWorkPlan.

---++ Ungoals
   * Security (covered in other parallel session)
   * Support centers (covered in detail last meeting)
   * Storage and data management (covered in other parallel sessions)

---++ Location and Attendance
   * Location--Physics and Astronomy Complex, room A214
   * Time--Monday Aug 21 4:30-6:30

We are dividing up the session into three main parts, as seen in the above table.  More explanation of the parts of the session are given below.

---+++  Site Overview and Deployment Best Practices Discussion

   *  Current Duties and Best Practices  Steve Timm and Leigh Grundhoefer
   *  The talks listed in the first half of the meeting are meant to spark discussion on these topics and  time will be given for discussion after each.
   *  Among topics covered here will be input to the VDT team for requirements on software updates.  Alain Roy of VDT team will be present.
   *   Two important documents in DOCDB, one is the OSG 0.4.1 CE best practices and the second one is NFS-Lite

---++++  Discussion--Leigh's talk
   * What is the purpose of Squid--for download of tarballs, not as frontend for redundant service.
   * Validation--GIP, how often does it check, 1 hour, sites are supposed to check if they are red--
should make GIP error a ticketable thing from the GOC now that it is required.
Comments--should know why are we red in case of failure
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/osg-site-overview.ppt][osg-site-overview.ppt]]: Leigh's OSG Software talk
---++++  Discussion--Steve's Talk
   * Greg--how to keep GUMS alive, no experts here, see K. Chadwick's talk in campus grids tomorrow, others say GUMS fix is 
being worked on but not here yet.  Most who are getting through are monitoring tomcats closely and restarting if necessary.
   * Alain--WSgram will still need NFS too, just substitute gridftp from globus-gass-server
---++++  Discussion--Razvan's Talk
   * Horst--some requirements, running with shared-nothing file systems for ATLAS, can it be done,
more discussion of nfs-lite
   * Rob, others, are the glite rpms razvan showed all necessary, can some of the file transfer utilities
in vdt/globus stack be used instead, maybe but have to interoperate with EGEE which is using
these glite ones.
---+++Alain Roy, VDT Updates
   *  What do people need to upgrade the full VDT to a new version?
   *  pacman -update or something else?
   *  Configuration sucker, from one directory to another?
   *   What to do with patches, need ways to roll in, roll out.
   *  For example, globus security update will be one that goes over top of existing globus, rolls out old files, if removed will come back.
   *  Several comments in favor of new install but with configuration sucker if possible.  (Iwona, Eileen).
   *  Run 2 simultaneously on same host, alternate ports?  Most people think not, better to go back and forth.
   *  What to do with running jobs
   *  Can some vdt configuration be cached outside of VDT_LOCATION (accidental deletes)
   *  vdt_app_data is intended for this but not used by all
   *  %RED% Main goal--install new VDT into new directory, easy switch to turn new one on, old one off, and then revert if possible%ENDCOLOR%
   *  symlinks--try /opt/osg-0.4.1, /opt/osg-0.5.0, then /opt/osg is a symlink
a83 1
---+++ Documentation and Troubleshooting Discussion
   * This section will not have a formal presentation but will be a facilitated discussion.
   * David Meyers and Shaowen Wang will lead out
   * Any changes or additions to the Integration set of documentation that we identify 
will be marked directly in the Integration twiki set.
   * Monitoring--what to do with non-osg jobs, makes MIS-CI, monalisa run too slow
      * [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/DocumentationTable050][ITB Docs]]
   *  Heterogeneous cluster--how to declare, what does a cpu-hour mean
   *  Policy--no good way to see what policy is from the GIP
   *  Do we need to split a monitoring box off?
---+++Batch System Configuration Discussion
   * Condor (Steve Timm, others)
   * SGE (Iwona Sakrejda)
   * LSF
   * PBS (Murali Ramsunder)
   * how to indicate case of site full of scavenger jobs, which OSG could preempt
   * how to show, declare, advertise batch system policies
   * Problem expressed--users discouraged because of site policies against very short, very long jobs
   * problems of blackhole nodes--how to get info back to job-submitting robots
   * minimal Condor install documentation, for either user Condor-G submit client or managedfork
 
---+++Wrap-up
   * Action items reviewed (5 minutes).
   * OSG/VDT installation help--experts at this session will arrange to meet afterwards one on one with people that need help.
   * Discuss options and implementation for OSG and VDT version updates.  Informal discussion can continue afterward with members of VDT team that will be present.
