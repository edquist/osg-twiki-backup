---+ Operations Support Research (VO Package)

| Version | Author | Notes |
| # version 0.1 | Christopher Pipes | Draft |

---++ Introduction and Goal

The OSG VO Package is a set of files maintained and distributed by the GOC. They configure OSG resources to gather VO user data from VOMS and GUMS services, they also allow users to get VOMS verified certificates from their VOs VOMS service.  

This document will outline the components of the VO Package in a broad overview, as well as, provide the links for detailed information of each component. Additionally, this document will provide the links necessary for a GOC Staff member to update the VO Package.


---++ Description

The VO Package consists of 3 files. 

   * *edg-mkgridmap.config:* is a periodic process (run via cron) that contacts a list of VOMS servers that you specify. It assembles a ist of users from those servers and creates a grid-mapfile on the CE. This grid-mapfile serves both as a list of authorized users and provides a mapping from user names to local user ids

   * *gums.template:* Grid User Management System (GUMS). A Grid Identity Mapping Service. It maps the credential for each incoming job at a site to an appropriate site credential, and communicates the mapping to the gatekeeper.

   * *vomses:* This file contains the user name, voms address, port number, and DN for each VO’s voms.
