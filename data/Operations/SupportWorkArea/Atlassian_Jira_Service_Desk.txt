---+ Operations Support Research (Jira Service Desk)

---++ Introduction
   
   * This document is to generate the discussion for the use of Atlassian HipChat and Jira Service Desk. With the goal of providing better service to our end users and the need for documentation, training, ticket reporting and tracking of support issues we have decided to explore other possible solutions outside of our current workflow model.

---++ *HipChat*

---+++ Pros

   * Free for up to 5 users. (for external users) 
   * Easy access for guests:  https://osg.hipchat.com/chat 
   * Search history
   * Attachments
   * Mobile Apps
   * Workstations Apps
   * Screen Sharing
   * Integrated video and Audio Chat
   * Get notifications directly into HipChat (Gocbot?)

---+++ Cons

   * External URL (can be hosted locally)
   * Pricing above 5 users
   * 


---+++ Other Info

   * 
   * 
   * 
---+++ *Jira Service Desk*

---+++ Pros

   * A seemingly intuitive interface
   * Able to build in SLA guidelines 
   * Real-Time Reporting. This may be able to provide better reporting tools. (Vince to comment on GRNOC reporting tool currently in DEV with systems.)
   * Syncing Issues to Knowledge Base
   * Customize-able Workflow Options

---+++ Cons

   * Current Pricing Model. Agents vs Users. JIRA Service Desk is sold on a per-user basis : this means you pay for every end-user using the system.
   *  Developmental control would be with jira... ? 

---+++ Other

   *  If this is something that we want to test. I think we would need to do some back end work since we only get a 30 trial before being charged. We could get a few ppl we trust in osg who would submit tickets to us etc... then we could try the kb and other add-ons.
