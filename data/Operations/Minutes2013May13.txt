---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Discovered glideinWMS 2.7 (5/7) bug where factory was not autocleaning logs, UCSD and CERN factory disks filled up.
      * glideinWMS team immediately released 2.7.1 pre-release (5/8) with bug fix and we applied it to UCSD and CERN
      * GOC factory disk started filling due to serving frontends 100% while UCSD and CERN recovered, but everything has since stabled out.
   * Encountered HTCondor bug on all factories (5/10) - grid managers were crashing due to missing voms extension on CMS pilot proxies.  This has been patched and fixed since 7.8.7 but we are still running 7.8.6 in production.
      * CMS has fixed the bad proxies and we recovered over the weekend.
   * Changed default glidein HTCondor to 64 bit version for running on workernodes (UCSD only until we confirm there are no issues).

---++ Operations This Week
   * Production release.
   * CAMon - DOEGrids reporting node (unused after PKI transition) will be turned off on 5/14
   * Rob, Scott, Soichi at FNAL May 22-24. Draft Agenda at https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/FNALOpsF2FMar2013
