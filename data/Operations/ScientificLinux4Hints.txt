---++Intro
In OSG 0.4.1/ VDT 1.3.10 and earlier, Scientific Linux 4 was not a supported OS for VDT.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 was a supported OS.  In VDT 1.3.11 this continues.  It is nevertheless quite possible to install on Scientific Linux 4.
The whole purpose of Scientific Linux project is to keep binary compatibility with the enterprise linux vendor from whose
open source rpms it is recompiled.  Therefore if there are found to be differences between Scientific Linux 4 and Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux 4, they need to be forwarded to the developers at scientific-linux-devel@scientificlinux.org.  There is 
also more information at http://www.scientificlinux.org.  

It is likely that some of these gotchas will apply to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as well.

Scientific Linux has the concept of "sites".  There is vanilla Scientific Linux, and then Scientific Linux as 
modified by Fermilab (Scientific Linux Fermi) and CERN (Scientific Linux CERN).  Most of the Fermi extensions are 
added extensions for Kerberos security.  There should be no OSG-visible differences between the three.

From VDT 1.3.12 and forward, Scientific Linux Fermi 4 is scheduled to be supported VDT operating system.

---++Gotchas I've found
   * The pacman install of the CE requires the command "which"  This is not in the base rpm's.  It can be provided under Sci. Linux Fermi with "yum install which"
   *  To build MIS-CI as part of the pacman install of the CE requires a build of SQLite--at least it did in OSG 0.4.1. This requires that gcc and gcc-c++ compilers be installed
   *  PRIMA requires a libcom RPM, compat-libcom_err rpm needs to be installed.
   *  Many packages require compat-libstdc++-33 rpm
   *  Pacman, even latest version, doesn't always recognize a platform correctly.  This can be done with
 =pacman -pretend_platform RHEL-4=
   *   As far as we know there are no differences in the sub-versions of RHEL-4/SL4 as far as pacman and VDT are concerned.
   *  Have to disable SELinux
   *   By default SL4 comes with firewall enabled--have to disable the default configuration and put in a different one (as documented in the twiki) to make OSG stuff work.
   *   Watch out for python installs--In early VDT 1.3.11 there were problems with VDT auto-detecting python libraries, which can be worked around either by grabbing the python libs from VDT or putting on the python-devel rpm before you install.  It's claimed this bug has been fixed, I have not yet checked.
