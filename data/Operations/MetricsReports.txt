   * The purpose of establishing and tracking metrics is to provide a means of evaluating how well a particular activity or process is performing against a set criterion.  In this case, the metrics track the number of tickets being created each month, over the span of six months and compares those numbers to the resolution rates. These metrics are also observed by the tickets that are open and how long each ticket has been opened.
