---+ Plan for OSG Software Repository at GOC

One side-effect of the transition to RPMs is that we have the ability to unify software repositories, and make GOC the primary endpoint for OSG software.

   * GOC will host the OSG Software development, testing, release, and contribu repositories at software.grid.iu.edu (and software-itb.grid.iu.edu for testing the repository creation process itself).  These require about 2 GB per repository (except contrib; size is currently minimal), and may grow to 3GB as time goes forward.
      * The creation of these repositories will be done using the =mash= tool.  OSG Software will provide the appropriate configuration files for =mash=, while Operations will script and automate its invocation.
   * The development and testing repositories will be updated automatically (cronjob every 30 or 60 minutes), but the release repository is only updated manually by designated team members.
      * The release repository will only be updated during designated release or maintenance windows.
   * The software repositories will be covered by the same SLA as the webserver.
   * GOC will host a rsync server so sites can create their own mirrors of the repository.  This service is to be low-priority, best-effort.
   * When the CA certificates are updated, OSG Security will submit these to the OSG Software Koji, and they will end up in the development repository.
      * OSG Software will implement ACLs such that OSG Security or Operations can handle the promotion of CA certificates to testing/release and the vomses-related packages to release.
   
---+ Timeline

   * This will be filled in once Software and Operations sign off on the deliverables.
