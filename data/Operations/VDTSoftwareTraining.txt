OSG Operations will be hosting a monthly training for the OSG Operations Support staff. The goal of these session are to increase the knowledge of the staff to triage and troubleshoot common issues. 

---++ VDT Software 
This will be the first training session and will focus on the VDT and OSG Software repositories, installations, and common software issues.  


---++ Agenda

   * *9:00 - 10:00* Presentation: Everything you need to know about the CE but were afraid to ask.
      * This will be a Powerpoint presentation. I will walk through what software is installed on a the CE, how it is installed, and what the software does in a fair amount of detail. For example:
         * How do we install with RPMs? 
         * How does a job arrive at a CE? (gatekeeper & job manager daemons)
         * How do we authenticate?
         * What's different in the new OSG 3.0 (as compared to OSG 1.2?)
         * How do Gratia probes work? 
         * How does CEMon/GIP work?
      * There will be lots of details, not just hand-waving. Process names, file locations, etc...

   * *10:00 - 10:30* A live demonstration of installing the CE
      * Alain will do an installation of the CE live. He'll run a couple of jobs and show what happens (Gratia data, GIP data, logs...)

   * *10:30 - 10:45* Coffee break

   * *10:45 - 11:15* Continue live demo

   * *11:15 - 12:00* Debugging common problems
      * General techniques for debugging
      * How to debug specific problems

   * *12:00 - 1:00* Lunch

   * *1:00 - 2:00* Debugging 2
      * We'll continue any debugging we didn't finish in the morning. In addition, Alain will provide:
	1 suggestions for how to collect better information up front
	2 suggestions on how to improve GOC/Software ticket handling
      * We can talk about these as much as desired.

   * *2:00 - 3:00* Alain has to run the OSG Software Team Meeting

   * *3:00 - 3:15* Coffee break
