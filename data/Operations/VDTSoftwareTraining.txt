---++ Agenda

   * *9:00 - 10:00* [[%ATTACHURL%/2012-09-16-software-training.pdf][OSG Software Training]]
      * This is be a Powerpoint presentation. I will walk through what software is installed on a the CE, how it is installed, and what the software does in a fair amount of detail. For example:
         * How do we install with RPMs? 
         * How does a job arrive at a CE? (gatekeeper & job manager daemons)
         * How do we authenticate?
         * What's different in the new OSG 3.0 (as compared to OSG 1.2?)
         * How do Gratia probes work? 
         * How does CEMon/GIP work?
      * There will be lots of details, not just hand-waving. Process names, file locations, etc...

   * *10:00 - 10:30* A live demonstration of installing the CE
      * Alain will do an installation of the CE live. He'll run a couple of jobs and show what happens (Gratia data, GIP data, logs...)

   * *10:30 - 10:45* Coffee break

   * *10:45 - 11:15* Continue live demo

   * *11:15 - 12:00* [[%ATTACHURL%/2012-09-16-debugging.pdf][Debugging Common OSG Software Problems]]
      * General techniques for debugging
      * How to debug specific problems

   * *12:00 - 1:00* Lunch

   * *1:00 - 2:00* Debugging 2
      * We'll continue any debugging we didn't finish in the morning. 
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/2012-09-16-a-few-suggestions.pdf][A few suggestions for ticket handling]]
      * We can talk about these as much as desired.

---++ Summary 

While it is hard to gauge success of the training short term, all initial feedback has been positive. I've asked the support staff to link tickets that they use knowledge of OSG Software Training session to Appendix A of this page. 

---++ Appendix A - Tickets

This will be an informal list of tickets that staff referenced the knowledge used in this training. This list may not be exhaustive and will be cut off on May 31st, 2012. 

---++ Appendix B - Post Training Feedback 

   * Kyle Gross - 
   * Elizabeth Chism - 
   * Alain Deximo - 
   * Chris Pipes - 
   * Scott Teige (Infrastructure)
The training was specifically structured to support staff and not toward infrastructure staff. This was by design and was absolutely appropriate. I was aware
of the function and structure of most components discussed but had never seen them presented as a system and found that extremely useful. Infrastructure and Support interact on a daily basis but the training provided an environment where each could see operations from the others point of view. Exposed during the training was at least one case where Infrastructure, using services internally, communicated poorly with the user and VDT community and this alone (from the 
infrastructure position)  was sufficient justification for the session. Finally, specific technical questions were discussed and solved and my take-away from that was
that everyone involved became aware of where answers could be obtained who to get them.
