---++ Robot or Automated Client Certificates discussion
---+++ Questions
   1. Describe the intended use and purpose. - allow for services that do automated tests, etc.  The question is whether the cert can leave the host it was generated on...and can the proxy leave the host as well.  A MyProxy server would be an acceptable solution for this.
   2. Is the certificate identifying a client or server, or both?
   3. How many instances of the robot or automated process need access to the private key?
   4. An individual is responsible for the certificate.  How often will this individual interact with the robot process?  
   5. How long will it run unattended before someone notices that something has gone wrong? In other words, how will it be monitored?
   6. Can a certificate with private key stored only on a hardware token be used?  If not, what protections can be used to ensure that the private key is not compromised?
   7. Why is it not possible to locate the process on a specific host, so a service certificate may be used?
---+++ Use Cases
   * RSV
