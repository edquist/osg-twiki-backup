---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesDecember11][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  Vanderbilt activity is increasing. The gatekeeper is back up. Jamie Frey helped them bring it online. They're still holding nanoHUB down to about 20 jobs due to a very high load average issue that is yet to be resolved.. UNM issues are resolved. Steve said that nanoHUB could use the support of at least a couple of sites to run more of their jobs. So GROW did agree to accept the jobs at GROW-UNI-P, per Eric. BNL was only offering 10-20 slots, so nanoHUB has opted to not run jobs there. The jobs are standard universe or PBS jobs. BNL did suggest running the jobs on STAR machines, perhaps 10 to start with, but they will be lower-priority jobs. If the results are satisfactory, he can submit more at their site.
