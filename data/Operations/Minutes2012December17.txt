   * Problems with maintenance:
      * 3 VM hosts did not boot after maintenance, problem solved by removing un-needed services and restarting. Running smoothly now.
      * All issues resolved within announced maintenance window.
      * Approximately 3 hours after work completed on is2 (Indianapolis BDII instance) a large asymmetry between the two instances was observed. This was coincident with problems with network in the IUPUI machine room. Machine was removed from DNS RR and restarted. Asymmetry returned to normal and remains there. A critical RSV metric has been created to monitor this quantity. No service interruption occurred.
