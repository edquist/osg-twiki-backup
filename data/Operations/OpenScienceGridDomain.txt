     Hi Rob,

     The godaddy.com website shows a sale price of $7.49/year (normally $8.99/year) to transfer an ORG domain, for 1-, 2-, 3-, or 5-year registrations.  <br>
     Renewal of an ORG domain is a bit steeper but diminishes if you renew several domains at once:  $14.99/year (qty 1-5 domains), and $9.99/year (qty 6-20).  <br>
     The general pricing to register a new ORG domain ranges from $6.99 for 1 year to $14.19 for 10 years.

     I'm not sure this is relevant, but we also have these domains:
     OPENSCIENCEGROUP.COM
     OPENSCIENCEGROUP.NET
     OPENSCIENCEGROUP.ORG

     All four domains expire in July, 2020.

     Darryl

---++ Technical Changes

IU DNS Administration Lists the following to do items.

   1. %GREEN%Obtain a copy of the opensciencegrid.org DNS zone from FNAL. If any subdomains of opensciencegrid.org have been delegated, we will have to deal with that at this point, whether to continue the delegations, or absorb those too.  This DNS zone information must be provided to the IUPUI dns-admin by FNAL.%ENDCOLOR%
   2. %GREEN%IUPUI dns-admin configures the IU nameservers to be authoritative for the opensciencegrid.org domain, and has UIUC set up authoritative slave service on UI nameservers (for backup), and will verify that the servers are responding to queries for information in the zone.%ENDCOLOR% 
   3. %GREEN%The administrative contact for the opensciencegrid.org domain (currently listed as Phillip !DeMar) must then update the list of authoritative nameservers in the domain registration to be dns1.iu.edu and dns2.iu.edu.  We will additionally list at least one of the UI servers in the authoritative NS records the zone data. They should also update the technical contact to be the IUPUI DNS admin %ENDCOLOR% %GREEN%(IU DNS admin will provide the details for that when needed).%ENDCOLOR% %GREEN%Since the new contact will be Rob Quick, he will need to change this registration accordingly. %ENDCOLOR%
   4. %RED%FNAL removes their DNS support for opensciencegrid.org (otherwise they will be seeing/using stale information after we start making changes).%ENDCOLOR% This should be scheduled for 3/1/2012 after all DNS caching has had a chance to update to the new location. 

---++ Day of Change Checklist

Tuesday's changes need to adhere to a timeline to be sure we don't point users toward bad pages (an non-updated twiki home page), here are the steps that need to be done one at a time.

   * %GREEN%Enable the Twiki Homepage at grid.iu.edu.%ENDCOLOR%
   * %GREEN%FNAL DNS admins change the address of www.opensciencegrid.org to the Twiki.%ENDCOLOR%
   * %GREEN%Have FNAL DNS copy and send us the updated zone file. (Insures consistency.)%ENDCOLOR%
   * %GREEN%Install the new zone file on IU DNS Servers%ENDCOLOR%
   * %GREEN%Update the DNS Server and Technical Contacts at GoDaddy.%ENDCOLOR%
   * %RED%Between 24-48 hours after the GoDaddy Change we remove the FNAL DNS entry. %ENDCOLOR%

IMPORTANT: No changes to the domain other than the update to the www.opensciencegrid.org should be allowed between the start and end of this process.

NOTES:
   * UI (UIUC) serves as backup to IU DNS
   * At step 3 the changes become visible to the outside world
   * Step 3 cannot be scheduled with timing finer than the day it is to occur
