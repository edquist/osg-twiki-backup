---++ Requirements for Operational Status Display

During the Operational Review Conducted at FNAL on May 26th and 27th a request was made for OSG Operations to provide a high level status display of Operational Services. Below are the requirements. 

   * This display should be able to provide the user an quick, high level view of the Health of Operational Services in OSG. 
   * Information should eventually include all Operational Services, though an initial version may start as a subset. These services may include, but are not limited to:
      * OSG Operational Services at the IU GOC
      * OSG Security Operations Services
      * OSG Accounting and Information Services at FNAL
      * OSG IT Administrative Services at the GOC and FNAL
      * The OSG WMS Glide In Factory at UCSD
      * Engage Services that are used by multiple VOs
   * All information should be concise and categorized by it's criticallity (as determined in the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]])
      * Due to the differences in browsers and displays, this may not be able to be contained in a single page, but should give the user an idea of the state of OSG Operations without scrolling. 
   * Historical details should be reachable via drill down
