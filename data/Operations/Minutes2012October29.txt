---++ WLCG Ops

---++ Security
Two Condor vulnerability announcements last week. 7.8.6 was released to address an issue with jobs being able to run as root on submit nodes where standard universe support is available. OSG provided rpms do not support standard universe, as well glidein provided condor installs should not be vulnerable. Other condor installations should be checked for a condor_shadow.std binary to see if they are vulnerable. Deleting this binary if the standard universe isn't needed should mitigate, although sites should upgrade when possible.

Also, an announcement was made about 7.6.10, which was released last month. This fixes several vulnerabilities of Moderate risk that could be used to control or submit arbitrary jobs remotely.
