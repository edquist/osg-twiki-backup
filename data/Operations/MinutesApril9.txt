A. What requests do we need to send to the Executive Team for sites to be approached and what expectations we should be asking for? 

B. Gratia can report the number of jobs Engage runs each day, the length of the jobs etc. Daily reports may be sent via email to help us gauge how well we are doing towards the goal of ~1000 job slots (and equivalent CPU Hours).

C. Can John provide a Site Survey with the maximum number of job slots we can expect from the sites being used and proposed for use by Engage VO?
