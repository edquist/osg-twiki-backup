---+Github Based VO Package Update Procedure 

---++ Purpose

This document will explain the step-by-step procedures for creating and releasing the VO Package. 

An explanation of the VO-Package contents can be found at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/SupportWorkArea/VOPackagePurposeUpdates.

The change log for previous releases can be found at: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/VOPackageReleases

A few things to know before outlining the update procedure. Every morning the goc@opensciencegrid.org inbox receives an automated email that outlines any new Registration tickets that were created in the last 24 hours. These tickets are automatically assigned to Rob Quick, Elizabeth Prout, and Kyle Gross for their review. If the request is for a new VO then the, requests are reviewed by the OSG council and are either approved or denied. This document assumes that all necessary parties have reviewed and approved the Registration Request(s), allowing the update to commence. 

__Adding new VOs will take an addition to each of these files.__ 

---++ Introduction

   This process begins when a ticket comes into the NOC from a person(s) requesting to start a VO or Remove a VO. Prior to making any changes to the VO-Package it is important to document the changes that are to be made. A member of the GOC will check if a page for the VO Package Releases has been created. If it has not been created then a new page will be created. Once the page has been created the GOC staff member will make note of the ticket number any changes that need to be made.
