---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly21][previous meeting]]
   * OSG 1.0.0 installations - Several resources plan to upgrade this week. 
   * DNS Cache Poisoning 
      * With DNS poisoning, an attacker can redirect users to another DNS servers. This puts visitors in jeopardy of downloading trojan horses. [[http://www.doxpara.com/][Steve Timm recommends this site with a "check DNS" feature]] 
   * CEmon resources not reporting after restart - Some users are still reporting to the old DNS. 

---++ Hot Topics for the week
   * [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OIM Web Updates]] 
      * Public views of registered resources, VOs, SCs, etc. Someone without a certificate can access a limited amount of information, but can't change anything 
      * Additional miscellaneous contacts can be added now - allows more people to edit a resource ... if they are added by an existing contact. 
      * Users with no registered DNs can access public information on the secure URL. 

---++ OSG RA Items
   * There was a problem with the UKeScienceRoot CA, the CRL expired. It didn't have an effect on the users, but the sites had expired CRLs en masse. The old hash is 8175c1cd. This can be removed.
