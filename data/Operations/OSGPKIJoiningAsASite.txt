This page is intended to provide guidance to sites who wish to use the OSG PKI.

---++ Preliminary Decisions

   1 All entities using the OSG PKI are registered as Virtual Organizations (VOs). Example the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][list of current OSG VOs]] and ensure your side doesn't already appear. (If it does, you want to contact the individuals listed under Contact Information for the VO in the list and discuss the situation with them. You probably just want to integrate your needs with the current registration.)
   1 Decide if you need user certificates, host/service certificates or both.
   2 If you need to issue user certificates, you will need to enroll one or more Registration Authority Agents.
   3 If you need to issue host/service certificates, you will need to enroll one or more Grid Admins. Consider what domains (e.g. 'example.edu') the hosts for which you will be issuing certificates will reside in. You will need to provide this list of domains when you enroll and additions will involve another request (i.e. the list is restrictive in that you cannot issue certificates outside of it).

---++ Registering as a OSG Virtual Organization (VO)

---+++ Registering a Support Center

A prerequisite to registering as a VO is to register as a Support Center. 
Support Centers -- large or small -- in OSG are charged with creating, receiving, and responding to trouble tickets from the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC). This will allow the GOC to assign you tickets related to your role as a RA/GA in OSG's PKI.
