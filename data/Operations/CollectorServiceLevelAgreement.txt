---++ Service Name and Description
---+++ !!Name
GOC Condor Collector


---+++ !!Description
The grid-facing component of the HTCondor compute element system available for use by all OSG VOs.
 
---++ Security Considerations
All information associated with the service is covered by the Indiana University [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/IUPrivacyPolicy][privacy policy]].
Effect of compromise of this service are limited to the service. A compromise may make the service unusable by compute elements using it. 

---++ Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times

This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see [[#Requests_for_Service_Enhancement][Requests for Service Enhancement]] for information on planned maintenance outages.

Any ongoing "High" or "Elevated" level issues will be discussed at the weekly [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes][Operations]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings][Production]] meetings.

---++ Service Availability and Outages
The GOC will strive for 90% service availability. If service availability falls below 90% monthly as monitored by the GOC a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders for plans to restore an acceptable level of service availability.

Reliability and availability will be determined by 2 critical RSV probes and the OSG availability algorithm.
   * One probe will verify the Condor collector is queryable whenever the host is pingable (i.e., reasonably not a network failure).
   * The other probe will verify an automatically generated configuration file has been updated recently

---++ Service Support Hours
This service will be run for 24x7, but support will primarily be within business hours.  The exception is for security incidents.

---++ Service Off-Hours Support Procedures
All operational issues should be reported as per [[#Customer_Problem_Reporting][Customer Problem Reporting]] section.

---++ Requests for Service Enhancements
OSG Operations will provide enhancement capabilities only as they are released by the !HTCondor project or OSG Technology Group. 
Requests for customization of the deployed service may be made; OSG Operations has the right of up to one month of testing of any change.

OSG will give 1 week of warning prior to any change in the Collector service version.
At any time during this week, Stakeholders are permitted to request a delay for up to 1 week after the originally scheduled upgrade. 

OSG Operations will schedule downtimes and configuration changes during normal business hours unless approved by affected stakeholders.  This is done so affected stakeholders are always on-hand in case if the downtime and changes cause further issues.


---++ Customer Problem Reporting
The GOC provides operators 24x7x365. Problems should be reported immediately by one of the following mechanisms. 

   * Creating a problem ticket at https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open (*preferred*)
   * Calling the GOC phone at 317-278-9699
   * Emailing a description to goc@opensciencegrid.org


---++ Responsibilities

   * The Collector will be run by OSG Operations and accessible to HTCondor compute elements.
   * Problems not associated with the hardware, operating system or network are the responsibilty of the Technology Group.

---++ Service Measuring and Reporting
The GOC will provide the following reports in the intervals indicated (monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually):
