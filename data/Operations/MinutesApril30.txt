Last week Burt mentioned that some sites that have upgraded to 0.6.0 appear to be missing from this list. It appears that site_verify may be timing out on those sites. A but has been filed w/the GOC. The bug appears to be due to the reading of files in /etc/xinetd.d and if site_verify can't read files due to the permissions, it times out and stops rather than skipping and moving on with the tests. Often this failure comes before it can read the OSG_VERSION.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments & Plans

MonALISA's deprecation is not appreciated. Gratia and the other monitoring tools don't provide a lot of useful data on a day to day basis as to what's going on. Wayne from STAR brought this issue up and was going to compile the data they are looking to obtain. Status?
