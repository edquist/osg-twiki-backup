This is an attempt to formalize the GOC Change Management Procedures in an official document. These procedures will be loosely based on the ITIL Incident Priority scheme. 

---++ Definitions

*Impact* - This is a measure of how critical the service is to the work being done. Impact is normally directly proportional to the number of users affected. 

*Urgency* - This is the need to react quickly to resolving the issue. Urgency should be determined by the level of service agreed to in the SLAs.

*Incident Priority* - Is a function of Impact and Urgency of a giving incident or change. 

---++ Incident Priority Schema

*Minor* - Minor changes that affect users of Operations Services. This includes changes to Operations Services that have a low Impact or Urgency. Approval will be given by the Operations Coordinator after consultation and review with the Production Coordinator. These changes will occur within the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ReleaseSchedule][scheduled release periods]]. 

*Major* - Major changes that affect users of Operations Services. This includes all items with high Impact or Urgency. Approval will be given by the Operations Coordinator after consultation and review with the Production Coordinator and a member of the Executive Team. These changes will occur within the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ReleaseSchedule][scheduled release periods]].
