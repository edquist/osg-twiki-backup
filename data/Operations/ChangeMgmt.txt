---+ Operations Change Management Procedures

---++ Introduction

This is an attempt to formalize the Operations Change Management Procedures in an official document. These procedures will be loosely based on the ITIL Incident Priority scheme. 

---++ Definitions

*Impact* - This is a measure of how critical the service is to the work being done. Impact is normally directly proportional to the number of users affected. This can also be dependent on the production level work being done at the time of the change. 

*Urgency* - This is the need to react quickly to resolving the issue. Urgency should be determined by the level of service agreed to in the SLAs. For services not yet functioning under as SLA Urgency will be determined by the Operations Coordinator with guidance from the Production Coordinator.

*Incident Priority* - Is a function of Impact and Urgency of a giving incident or change. 

---++ Incident Priority Scheme

Using the follow table each change will be given an Priority:

5 = Routine 
4 = Normal 
3 = Minor 
2 = Major
1 = Emergency

*Routine* - Everyday continuous maintenance events. This includes but is not limited to routine scheduled maintenance events. Approval of the Routine events will be given by the Operations Coordinator.

*Normal* - This includes common changes. Approval of Normal changes will be given by the Operations Coordinator.

*Minor* - Minor changes that affect users of Operations Services. This includes changes to Operations Services that have a low Impact or Urgency. Approval will be given by the Operations Coordinator after consultation and review with the Production Coordinator. These changes will occur within the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ReleaseSchedule][scheduled release periods]]. 

*Major* - Major changes that affect users of Operations Services. This includes all items with high Impact or Urgency. Approval will be given by the Operations Coordinator after consultation and review with the Production Coordinator and a member of the Executive Team. These changes will occur within the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ReleaseSchedule][scheduled release periods]]. 

*Emergency* - Events with high impact and urgency. These incidents will be handled as defined in the SLA for the Operations Service in question. The Executive Team and the Production Coordinator will be alerted of any changes classified as Emergency.
