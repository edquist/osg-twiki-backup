---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO Spotlight on SBGrid

80 labs across country, Harvard Medical School in Boston. currently 2 people working on the high performance computing side. Working with Condor for a couple of weeks and the installation is not yet complete. One of the questions is who is their support group? Rob explained their options: to use CSC, form their own Support Center and support their users directly, or utilize support resources already being provided by another group. A CE is being brought up soon and they have been encouraged by the GOC to support the MIS VO and the GOC will run a series of site_verify tests on the site. SBGrid is not in the current VO package because they're still getting things up and running (VOMS server, for example). A lot of activity is anticipated in the next couple of weeks as they get their CE up and become more active in OSG.
