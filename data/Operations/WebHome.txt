---++ Introduction
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
---+++ Mission

The mission of OSG Operations and the Grid Operations Center is to  provide the highest quality services and support.

This is accomplished by:
   * Operating and maintaining our services in a user-oriented, robust, and reliable manner.
   * Developing a professional and skilled staff dedicated to a service philosophy.
   * Managing resources responsibly, efficiently, and with accountability.
   * Evaluating and continually improving the actions, methods and processes that allow the OSG to operate.

---+++ Operations Activity Objectives and Scope

OSG Operations activities can be split into two often overlapping areas: 
   1. Operations Support: Focuses on OSG collaborator support and administrative and communication mechanisms that allow quick and accurate contact, tracking, and communication withing the collaboration, and 
   1. Operations Infrastructure: Provides the technical services necessary to produce and disseminate vital information to the OSG community, along with the hardware structure necessary to make this information available. 

---+++ The Grid Operations Center (GOC) at Indiana University

Based at Indiana University, the GOC provides a single point of operational support for the  Open Science Grid (OSG). OSG Operations performs real time Grid monitoring and problem tracking, provides support to users, developers and systems administrators, maintains grid services, provides security incident response, and maintains information repositories. Operations provides the OIM Registration Database for the Support Centers, Virtual Organizations, and Services. A list of Operations Services is presented and/or linked off of [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/about][MyOSG]].

The Grid Operations Center blog is located at [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/]]. For more information see [[TheGOC][*What is the GOC?*]]
