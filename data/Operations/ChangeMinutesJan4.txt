---++ Announcements
 
---++ Operations last week
   * Bug in BDII RSV Probe caused RSV tests to fail from Midnight on 1/1 until ~22:00. This was noticed by the GOC but not considered critical since the BDII was working fine.

---++ Operations this week
   *  Nothing in the works, will do a RSV release next week to remove dependency on UNL.
   * Await results of BDII testing before adding is4 to DNS RR.
      * _The filter on is4 allows storage only resources to publish, is1 and is2 do not. These will be made consistent next release, location of the change to be discussed during production call._

---++ TWiki authentication
   * Need to discuss problem with FNAL certificates. How to resolve?
      * _Need to discuss with Mine to determine if changing FNAL certificate is feasible/desirable_

---++ Top Level BDII at the GOC
   * Currently await statement from stakeholders regarding adoption.

---++ Ticket Synchronization with FNAL
   * We should give this one more hard look and attempt. 

---++ Pakiti
