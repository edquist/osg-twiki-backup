---+ The OSG GOC
The Grid Operation Center (GOC) based at Indiana University is tasked with supporting the operational needs of the users, resource providers, and collaborators of the Open Science Grid (OSG). The GOC consists of human and compute services provided to maximize operational functionality of the OSG. The OSG is the only current grid infrastructure supported by the GOC, but the GOC remains open to hosting grid related services for other national and regional research grids. 

More details are available in the [[%ATTACHURL%/TheGOC.doc][TheGOC.doc]] document.
