---++ Security
   * Had report of a security incident from another grid. Looks like only one OSG user in list of affected users, didn't have OSG credentials on the system.
   * Trojan FileZilla in the wild. Make sure you download from a truested source.
   * Remote code execution vulnerability in MediaWiki. Updates have been released and should be installed.
   * Still hoping to make next osg certs release the last one with old-format certs.
