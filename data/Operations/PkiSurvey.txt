usability survey for OSG PKI

Notes:

Scott
Von
Kyle
Alain
Soichi
Rob


Von: Yes should do survey.  Waiting is good til Oct-Nov is good. Gauging usability is a good goal.  Flush out if there are any other needs.  See if there are other technologies that OSG is interesting in bringing to to the table.

Scott: Surveymonkey

Von: difficulty in getting CA certs in browser.  

Alain: password forgetting. (it doesn't work)  Gridadmin/RA - make sure they fill in the request letter. People not paying attention to prompting to go get their cert.  last minute requests can be problematic.

Idea is to not find the things that we already know about… but to find the things that people haven't reported.  

RA/GA people tend to be forward about asking questions.  

Communication with Alain is strong, which is good.  

we need users to genuinely ask uses for real answers…not just high fives

March is too late.  

host certs users… command line

Ask about whether people know how to find policies and instructions. - look to see how other CAs get users to see these things.

At least Three surveys 

Comm/Document/OIM/Command Line/ sections

Certificate Maintenance - Certificate Security
