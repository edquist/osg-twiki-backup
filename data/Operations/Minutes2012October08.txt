---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * glideinWMS software team helped us determine high load issues was due to an unexpected python behavior.
      * For each forked process using popen, python attempts to close all file descriptors by default.
      * We had set high max file descriptor limits (~50k) for the gfactory user previously to accommodate the Atlas testing.
      * Reducing limits (back to default 1k) on ITB cut the load on the machine in half.  This weekend I reduced the limits on UCSD and GOC Production.
