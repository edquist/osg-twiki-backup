---++ August 7
1. Reminder: Gridscan's (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS) new DN is /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Leigh Grundhoefer (GridScan) 274052 The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership is MIS. Previous announcements have been made and the GOC will begin creating tickets for failing sites.

2. 2269 Fermi/Remedy - 82585 - goc@opensciencegrid.org forwarding
The GOC is moving to a new mail server. We are waiting for Fermilab to identify all addresses in the opensciencegrid.org domain that will need to be forwarded to the new server.

3. 2305 NWICG-NotreDame Resource/Service Registration was reviewed and approved.

4. GridCat - sites are on it that should be removed. If groups send email to the GOC we will open a ticket(s) to have them removed.

---++ August 14
1. Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
Error 123 could not write job state file is the Condor_G error. Doug has been working with Jaime Frey with the Condor Team to resolve the problem. Alain Roy will followup w/Jaime.

2. Ticket loops between VDT & GOC resolved. Alain Roy has created a script for use with their ticketing system, RT, to prevent ticket looping. This may be helpful to other SC's using RT (GRASE & PROD_SLAC). Alain asks that any groups using RT may contact him to obtain the script.

3. Usage of OSG resources report. This week: the STAR VO.
They are using only their resources, not other Resources on the grid. There are five STAR sites. They have a lot of problems with SGE and they're trying to get support on those issues. Refer to http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/STAR_UtilStatus

4. 2269 Fermi/Remedy - 82585 - goc@opensciencegrid.org forwarding. All aliases have been identified. We're working on stabilizing the system monitoring.

5. 2356 Remove the NO VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo accounting from the ML plots. There were no objections to this change. Change completed.
