---++ OSG New PKI Planning Phase Punch List

Command Line Clients
   * packaging guidelines/spec
      * platforms supported (linux only?)
      * package management (rpm? other?)
         * tarball requested by ESG
   * Do we need to patch M2Cryto for DC component support?
   * completion of OIM testing/implemention
      * I think this is getting into implementation? - Von

Following are my current punch items for [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit][OIM certificate management design doc]]:

   * How do we synchronize list of FQDNs registered in OIM for each GridAdmins with list of FQDNs that DigiCert allows us to issue certificates? My current understanding is that, when GOC receives a request from someone to become a GridAdmin, GOC will interact with DigiCert manually, then once the request is approved by DigiCert, GOC will update the information in OIM and inform our user that he/she can now approve host certificates. There may or may not be an automated process to make sure OIM and DigiCert are synchronized later.
      * DigiCert exposed the domain list through MPKI: https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php
   * Can we request DN-override when we send CSR to DigiCert? (Jeremy is currently waiting to hear back from DigiCert on this).
   * We are planning *not* to provide CLI tool to make user certificate request (Please see "Features" table on the design doc). Will this cause any issues? Can we assume that all user will make request via OIM UI?
   * Host certificate signing process seems to take very long time on DigiCert (5-10 minutes). This means that we will not be able to provide "bulk host certificate requests script" that works like the DOEGrid version. User will need to request & approve, then wait for a notification that all certificates are signed, the proceed to download the certificates at later time.

      * Address comments from Jim
   * (Jim) DN Transition Plan
      * Address comments from Von
   * (Mine) RA Training Plan
      * Address comments from Von
   * (Von and Alain R) Acceptance criteria
      * Acceptance testing should consider Integration TestBed (ITB) testing of certificate from the new OSG CA.
   * (Von) Develop a plan for how OSG and DigiCert will interact, in terms of technical issues (REST API changes), user support issue resolution, and business processes. 
   * (Rob) Document what operational changes will come about from the CA transition and plan for addressing those changes.
   * (Ruth) Develop a communications plan for OSG users. 
      * In progress: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/doegrid.transition.v2.doc
   * (Von) Document any users of OSG that are currently using the DOE Grids CA whom should be transitioned to another CA, and develop a plan for transitioning those users. E.g., users outside the U.S. 
      * In progress, will be part of next Certificate Usage document
   * (Ruth and Von) Develop a transition plan with a list of users (both current OSG users and other identified DOE Grids user communities) who should be invited to try out the new OSG CA and a timeline for their invitation.
      * In progress
   * (Von, Jim, Alain D.) Figure out how were going to get all the OSG RA Agents vetted as DigiCert? RA's. 
      * This is related to transition plan.
