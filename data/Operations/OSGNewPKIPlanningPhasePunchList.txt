---++ OSG New PKI Planning Phase Punch List

[[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZJMyEfdS5Ye7lLyaJxWpr-MV-PpX-LsVRUQRTfSC-A/edit][Command Line Client]]
   * Address comments from Von
   * packaging guidelines/spec
      * Must have RPMs
      * Older OSG 1.2 software are not installing RPMs - using old PACMan install - will phase out by end of the year
      * tarball requested by ESG, plan on doing this as well.
         * Deal with dependencies by including them in a README.

Following are my current punch items for [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit][OIM certificate management design doc]]:

   * How do we synchronize list of FQDNs registered in OIM for each GridAdmins with list of FQDNs that DigiCert allows us to issue certificates?
      * My current understanding is that, when GOC receives a request from someone to become a GridAdmin, GOC will interact with DigiCert manually, then once the request is approved by DigiCert, GOC will update the information in OIM and inform our user that he/she can now approve host certificates. There may or may not be an automated process to make sure OIM and DigiCert are synchronized later.
      * DigiCert exposed the domain list through MPKI: https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php
      * With API can run daily remote to check for mismatches and alert GOC.
   * Can we request DN-override when we send CSR to DigiCert? (Jeremy is currently waiting to hear back from DigiCert on this).
   * We are planning *not* to provide CLI tool to make user certificate request (Please see "Features" table on the design doc). Will this cause any issues? Can we assume that all user will make request via OIM UI?
      * Most certificates are not registering in OIM - is there a connection here between this and not using a web browser?
      * We are talking about a CLI client that replicates current DOE Grids PKI functionality.
      * Decision: We are planning to implement a DOE Grids like User Certificate CLI client. If user demands requires one, it seems like a manageable one to add.
   * Host certificate signing process seems to take very long time on DigiCert (5-10 minutes). This means that we will not be able to provide "bulk host certificate requests script" that works like the DOEGrid version. User will need to request & approve, then wait for a notification that all certificates are signed, the proceed to download the certificates at later time. 
     * Jeremy saw 15-30 s delay during his testing. Soichi says it has changed in the last week.
     * DOE Grids had a one delay
     * One step for bulk requests is a requirement - Tony.
     * Greg has forwarded this on and is waiting for response. Is this delay expected?
   * Needs feedback on auditing - will get that from Acceptance Criteria document.
   * Need to have code review. 


Other documents:

   * (Keith) Contingency Plan
      * Address comments from Jim
   * (Jim) DN Transition Plan - https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DOEGrids2DigiCertDNTransition
      * May be Done. Von to review.
   * (Mine) RA Training Plan - https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
      * Address comments from Von
   * (Von and Alain R) Acceptance criteria
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-PKI-Acceptance-Criteria-1.docx
      * Acceptance testing should consider Integration TestBed (ITB) testing of certificate from the new OSG CA.
      * Include Mine from OSG Security Team.
   * (Von) Develop a plan for how OSG and DigiCert will interact, in terms of technical issues (REST API changes), user support issue resolution, and business processes. 
      * Draft of enrollment & vetting processes: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-PKI-Vetting-workflows-1.docx
      * To do: Support and change control:
         * DigiCert will maintain current Test CA and will allow us to specific API version so we can use for testing new APIs.
   * (Rob) Document what operational changes will come about from the CA transition and plan for addressing those changes.
      * Status unknown.
   * (Ruth) Develop a communications plan for OSG users. 
      * In progress: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/doegrid.transition.v2.doc
   * (Von) Document any users of OSG that are currently using the DOE Grids CA whom should be transitioned to another CA, and develop a plan for transitioning those users. E.g., users outside the U.S. 
      * Done, part of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-certificate-usage-analysis-3.pdf][Certificate Usage Analysis document]]
   * (Von) Develop a transition plan with a list of users (both current OSG users and other identified DOE Grids user communities) who should be invited to try out the new OSG CA and a timeline for their invitation.
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-PKI-Transition-Plan-1.docx
      * Comments to be addressed in document:
         * Goal is not to have all DOE Grids certificates replaced by Operations
         * Goal is to have system tested and accepted.
         * Is there a goal for % of certificates replaced or some other objective metric?
   * (Von, Jim, Alain D.) Figure out how were going to get all the OSG RA Agents vetted as DigiCert? RA's. 
      * This is related to transition plan.
      * Not started. Pending resolution of "need for photo id" issue with DigiCert.
   * (Von) Complete the execution of legal and policy agreements with DigiCert started during the Pilot phase.
      * 5/8 New versions received from DigiCert with simplified language, folks should review LRA
      * Shooting for 6/1 execution.
