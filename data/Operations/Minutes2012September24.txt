---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * ITB Factory stuck again after reboot, Tom discovered it may be due network adapters failing to startup correctly
   * Discovered glideinWMS bug causing the wrong condor tarballs to be selected on the workernode for the glideins to use
      * This is only affecting ITB Factory right now (running special glideinWMS branch_v2_6_1_gf1) and we are working with glideinWMS support to get it solved.

---++ Operations This Week
   * Production release
   * Operating system updates, reboots will be required.
