---+ Development of Standard Operating Procedures for OSG Operations.

Operating procedures are initiated by some type of event that causes or motivates
an action to occur.  The main purpose of the documents are to guide the human
actions an illustrate the workflow.

---++ Requirements

Procedures for GOC and Support Center staff contributing to OSG Operations
need to be documented, aproved, published, and followed, to make a smooth and efficient
operation for OSG, and to enable a process for improving operations.

	* List of procedures
	* Publication point for procedures
	* Type of access control for SOP documents

---++ Reference examples

If there are reference examples please put links here.
