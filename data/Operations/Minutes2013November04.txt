   * Indiana Statewide IT meeting in Bloomington through Wednesday.
   * ENMR successfully submitted to FNAL. 

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * SDSC Factory stopped at 13:28 PDT Thursday Oct 31st. The factory collector was temporarily unresponsive, and new code in glideinWMS v3_2_1 caused the factory to stop unexpectedly.
      * A protection was added in v3_2_1 to prevent the factory from starting if condor wasn't started first.  We hit an unintended corner case that would cause the factory to shut off if condor becomes temporarily unavailable due to load issues.
      * glideinWMS developers supplied a patch for us that we put in place, so this should not happen again.
