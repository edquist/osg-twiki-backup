---+++ RSV/WLCG 
   * Rob, Scott, Soichi met with David Collados 14-15/Apr to discuss RSV/WLCG issues
      * !GridView to be phased out. This effects RSV/WLCG comparison reports.
      * No action _required_ by GOC to maintain other current operations
      * Some format changes, additional fields will allow removal of a component at SAM
      * Some messages have a serviceType not handled (directly) by the SAM consumer. Will work to correct/remove these as appropriate.
      * Will reconfigure message endpoints for failover. Four, geographically distributed, endpoints are available.
   * RSV-ITB currently uses replicated database that was hosted on a development server, await verification from SAM messages are being received and are correct
   * Remove SAM-BDII monitoring at GOC, service no longer in use. (Will verify with stakeholders)
   * Remove "Metric Descriptions" upload, changes very rarely.

---+++ OIM
   * Currently a single instance hosted in Indianapolis
   * Would like to move this to Bloomington because physical facilities are superior.
      * Will be on an announced change day, working to minimize impact.

---+++ WLCG BDII 
   * Hoping for implementation "near the end of the year"

---+++ GGUS version change
   * test instance remains down, await notification new version instance is available.
