---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * OSG services machines all had kernel updates and reboots
   * Large network outage at Fermilab primarily affected CMS Tier 1 but had secondary impact on FermiGrid services.  As far as we can determine OSG Gratia, VOMS, and ReSS were not affected but job submission to FermiGrid managed gatekeepers (FNAL_FERMIGRID, FNAL_GPGRID_1) was.
   * Reporting name of ATLAS in Gratia was changed from "usatlas" to "atlas", ATLAS OIM registration needs to be changed to match.
   * Continue to work with unknown/unregistered VO's, total VO count now 148 and will drop by 40 more later this week.
