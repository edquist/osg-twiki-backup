*Updated Agreements & Documents*

All the latest versions of all agreements and documents are attached for convenience. Here's are some relevant callouts on each one:
   * Main Agreement:
      * Pricing has been added (landed at $175,000 - a non-material change from original proposal; annual payments are still ok if that's better for OSG); I'm at your disposal if you have any questions here
   * OSG Agent Agreement:
      * Has been updated to a "click-thru" format
      * To be presented the first time anybody who can approve certificates (so OSG admins or its "RA Agent" admins) accesses the system
         * Will you let us know if this looks ok to you?  If so, we'll enable it for click-thru within the system
   * Subscriber Agreement:
      * Certificate Subscriber Agreement -- this is the agreement that the end-user will click-thru to receive the user or host certificate
         * There is an open-dialog relating to these that I don't believe we resolved due to my absence of the past couple weeks - I've called it out in its own "Subscriber Agreement Process" section below
   * Sponsor Attestation:
      * This is the document that is provided by DigiCert to OSG as an example/template of the documentation OSG should collect from sponsors
      * This attestation is under OSG's control, but it (or something similar) needs to be in place for each sponsor for audit purposes
   * RPS:
      * Updated with your latest recommendations

*Subscriber Agreement Process*

You may recall just prior to my absence that we discussed the process of the subscriber agreement (both for Host certs and User certs) -- the issue was that DigiCert needs to have the click-thru subscriber agreement in place for each end-user -- you and I briefly discussed options for facilitating this, but I thought I'd articulate them again here for clarity's sake:
   * Subscriber Agreement Process (User Certificates)
      * Option A:  Simply have OSG take the final version of the subscriber agreement and include it within the interface OSG will develop (in such a manner as to ensure the end-user clicks-thru prior to having the cert issued) and then simply giving DigiCert an account within that system to be used for audit purposes
      * Option B:  Upon receiving a user cert request from OSG, DigiCert system would automatically send the user an email that contains the click-thru agreement and would then issue the cert when the agreement is clicked-thru (this is essentially the same process as an email challenge, which I recall as something that wasn't super appealing to your team from an API standpoint - but it is an option nevertheless)
   * Subscriber Agreement Process (Host Certificates)
      * Option A:  Same as for user certificates - simply have OSG take the final version of the agreement and include it within the interface OSG will develop (in such a manner as to ensure the end-user clicks-thru prior to having the cert issued) and then simply giving DigiCert an account within that system that it can use for audit purposes
      * Option B:  Upon receiving a host cert request from OSG, DigiCert system would check if the user has had a user cert issued to them and would then, upon confirmation, send the user an email that contains the click-thru agreement and would then issue the cert when the agreement is clicked-thru.
         * As I recall, your off-the-cuff preference was Option A, but would you mind confirming?  We can certainly talk it through as/if needed

*Post-Pilot Development*

Just wanted to capture the couple remaining items that DigiCert either mentioned to OSG was in the works or that we collectively identified in the feature matrix as not necessary for the pilot, but desired for production.  Anyway, as an FYI, here are those few items that our dev team is working on - just wanted you to know these hadn't fallen off our radar:
      * Blacklist Check -- system automatically checks cert domain against a standard DigiCert "blacklist" to protect against admins issuing a cert for a high-profile domain (e.g. Google.com, etc.); Intended as one of the protections to DigiCert and OSG from having to explain something of that nature (I think this feature was actually in place during the pilot, but since I haven't yet confirmed internally, I'm leaving it listed for the moment)
      * New Domain Submission Confirmation -- part of validation process; checkbox for OSG/administrative personnel within system to confirm they have approval to issue certs on the new domain (I don't think this one ever got added to the matrix, we just discussed verbally during the production test-cert process as an improvement to be made)
      * Two-Factor Authentication/OTP - this one has been on the feature matrix

*Other Items*

      * Robot Certs -- I understand we're all set there and there are no outstanding questions/issues - just wanted to confirm
Additional Test Certs -- I understand those have either been issued or are in process via Jim - holler if you have any questions
      * Publicly Trusted SSL Certs -- Regarding the 30-ish standard SSL certs that OSG may need, I couldn't locate any notes on how many domains are covered in that estimate - apologies if you sent that over and I didn't capture it - but if you can kick that over to me I can determine if we can aggressively get you taken care of - which we'd like to do if we can - at this point it will be better to just execute a completely separate (and simple, standard) agreement for those rather than muddy the waters of the grid cert main agreement
      * 30-Day CRLs -- we met internally and discussed it last week and since the grid-related certs aren't publicly trusted, moving to 30 days was not a problem; I just confirmed with our tech folks that this update has already been completed
      * CNs for First Issuance -- I haven't yet connected with Scott on this one, so I'll punt to him to be prepared with an update tomorrow (for our call or via email update)

Greg, Scott, AAron

Outstanding items from my side:
   * Certificate for Brian B. (red-gridftp.unl.edu)
      * Yes, Jim should like Scott and Greg know when he adds domain and issues cert.
   * OSG RA vetting - what do they need?
      * Jim can do and further delegate
   * RPS and agreements
      * In process
   * CRL lifetime (30 days vs one week)
      * In process
   * Can we chose CNs for first issuance to make DN change easier?
      * Scott thinks so, wants to think about it.
