---+ May 2, 2012

   * Updated and cleaned agreement sent over? We don't believe so.
   *RA Agent signature process - "Can RA Agent sign saying they talked to Sponsor instead of sponsor having sign something" - they put off discussing it at their last meeting, IGTF meeting next week.
   * PII issue - Jeremy is their in house council - had concerns about compliance, can't remember details - this may not be issue on non-public trust side?
      * Does IGTF have any other CPs that cover auditing documentation?
   * Test CA - will ask Jeff about this - do we have two parallel API keys? Does the Test CA evolve into production?
   * Registering domains for non-host institutions - right now they domains for host certs and email are tied together. they have talked about splitting it out.

No call, but exchanged email with Aaron:

Indemnification (RA Agent Agreement):
Met with our legal group, and it looks like the optimal solution will be to shift the indemnity/legalese to IU.
We will make that update/modification and send over

RA Agent Signature Process:
This one has sparked an impressive amount of internal debate in an effort to accommodate the use case you explained last week while still remaining IGTF compliant
We're in the process of working things through with the IGTF folks to make sure we can adjust things without putting our certification at risk
So this not resolved yet, but very much in process 

RPS 3.2.3 - Fermilab and PII Question:
Were you able to find out if Fermilab employees can "collect" PII but can't "store" PII?  I believe you were going to clarify the actual rules they needed to abide by on this one.

RPS 5.2.1 - Separation of Duties:
We confirmed with our legal group that what Scott and I explained last week in terms of having two people involved (but who may be separated by time) was accurate
I noted that if our explanation from our call last week was correct, that you' were ok with this - so unless I hear otherwise, I'll treat this one as resolved

CNs for First Issuance:
We officially ran this past our tech folks and there weren't major concerns
Our team has suggested a process through which DigiCert would provide a search function that allows OSG to input a name, search for a duplicate, and if one is discovered the common name can be changed by your team to match what you need it to within your system - in concept does that sound ok to you?

Certificate Overage:
If OSG were to go over the levels described in the Master Agreement, DigiCert can facilitate additional certificates:
=numbers redacted, talk to Von=
And, as mentioned last week, our intent is to nurture a long-term relationship with OSG, so we'd be open to dialog should something like this, or otherwise unexpected, arise (in particularly, if OSG discovered it will surpass the levels in the agreement in a substantial fashion, we would want to revisit pricing within that context)

---+ April 4, 2012

In general, I'm concerned about the level of legality we're putting on the RA Agents (and Sponsors?). Sociologically this is going to be a big jump for them from the current agreements (see A.3 of http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf). A specific concern is by requiring indemnification, this will change the document from something they sign personally, into a institutionally signed document, which will bring a whole mess of lawyers into this process. I'd like to discuss and see what flexibility we have at this level.

   * Digicert: haven't had a chance to dialog with legal team.

 I'm confused about Sponsor registration - the structure map shows a "Sponsor Agmt" but I don't believe I've seen this document. I do have an Sponsor Attestation document, but I understand that to be per-issuance. (I thought we discussed at one time Sponsorships was something RA Agents would simply record?)

   * There is no sponsor agreement. Asking sponsors signing attestation or something similar.
   * Can RA Agent sign saying they talked to Sponsor instead of sponsor having sign something.
   * If this is OK with IGTF accredidation it's OK.

 And I'd like some pricing information on what happens if the certificate levels described in 5.1 of the Master Agreement are exceeded.

   * Typically would give an overage rate - how would we like to have this reflected - can do per certificate or can bulk tiers. Let's do per 25 users and 100 hosts. I don't need contractual here, just verbal.

RPS:

3.2.3: Collecting PII is an issue, but I think we're OK here if we can use personal attestation of the sponsors. Just want to make sure we're on the same page on that interpretation.

    * Is this just an issue with RA Agent process?
    * We don't have to hold this, it's just a pass through to DigiCert.
    * Can we work this out so that things go directly to DigiCert?

5.2.1:  I read this as a strict separation of duties that includes vetting and administration of the RA systems, that's a problem. How should I be interpreting this?

   *  The interpretation is the vetting of the Agent and the Agent requesting are the two steps.

5.4.1: Clarified "computer systems" as "RA systems" which I believe is the intent.

   * Yes.

6.2: I feel I'm just missing a statement somewhere about private key protection for host/service keys which are usually accessed by a process and not a person and hence protected by file system permissions rather than password.

   *  Have changes to address.

   * CNs for First Issuance -- I haven't yet connected with Scott on this one, so I'll punt to him to be prepared with an update tomorrow (for our call or via email update)

*Updated Agreements & Documents*

All the latest versions of all agreements and documents are attached for convenience. Here's are some relevant callouts on each one:
   * Main Agreement:
      * Pricing has been added (landed at $175,000 - a non-material change from original proposal; annual payments are still ok if that's better for OSG); I'm at your disposal if you have any questions here
   * OSG Agent Agreement:
      * Has been updated to a "click-thru" format
      * To be presented the first time anybody who can approve certificates (so OSG admins or its "RA Agent" admins) accesses the system
         * Will you let us know if this looks ok to you?  If so, we'll enable it for click-thru within the system
   * Subscriber Agreement:
      * Certificate Subscriber Agreement -- this is the agreement that the end-user will click-thru to receive the user or host certificate
         * There is an open-dialog relating to these that I don't believe we resolved due to my absence of the past couple weeks - I've called it out in its own "Subscriber Agreement Process" section below
   * Sponsor Attestation:
      * This is the document that is provided by DigiCert to OSG as an example/template of the documentation OSG should collect from sponsors
      * This attestation is under OSG's control, but it (or something similar) needs to be in place for each sponsor for audit purposes
   * RPS:
      * Updated with your latest recommendations

*Subscriber Agreement Process*

You may recall just prior to my absence that we discussed the process of the subscriber agreement (both for Host certs and User certs) -- the issue was that DigiCert needs to have the click-thru subscriber agreement in place for each end-user -- you and I briefly discussed options for facilitating this, but I thought I'd articulate them again here for clarity's sake:
   * Subscriber Agreement Process (User Certificates)
      * Option A:  Simply have OSG take the final version of the subscriber agreement and include it within the interface OSG will develop (in such a manner as to ensure the end-user clicks-thru prior to having the cert issued) and then simply giving DigiCert an account within that system to be used for audit purposes
      * Option B:  Upon receiving a user cert request from OSG, DigiCert system would automatically send the user an email that contains the click-thru agreement and would then issue the cert when the agreement is clicked-thru (this is essentially the same process as an email challenge, which I recall as something that wasn't super appealing to your team from an API standpoint - but it is an option nevertheless)
   * Subscriber Agreement Process (Host Certificates)
      * Option A:  Same as for user certificates - simply have OSG take the final version of the agreement and include it within the interface OSG will develop (in such a manner as to ensure the end-user clicks-thru prior to having the cert issued) and then simply giving DigiCert an account within that system that it can use for audit purposes
      * Option B:  Upon receiving a host cert request from OSG, DigiCert system would check if the user has had a user cert issued to them and would then, upon confirmation, send the user an email that contains the click-thru agreement and would then issue the cert when the agreement is clicked-thru.
         * As I recall, your off-the-cuff preference was Option A, but would you mind confirming?  We can certainly talk it through as/if needed

*Post-Pilot Development*

Just wanted to capture the couple remaining items that DigiCert either mentioned to OSG was in the works or that we collectively identified in the feature matrix as not necessary for the pilot, but desired for production.  Anyway, as an FYI, here are those few items that our dev team is working on - just wanted you to know these hadn't fallen off our radar:
      * Blacklist Check -- system automatically checks cert domain against a standard DigiCert "blacklist" to protect against admins issuing a cert for a high-profile domain (e.g. Google.com, etc.); Intended as one of the protections to DigiCert and OSG from having to explain something of that nature (I think this feature was actually in place during the pilot, but since I haven't yet confirmed internally, I'm leaving it listed for the moment)
      * New Domain Submission Confirmation -- part of validation process; checkbox for OSG/administrative personnel within system to confirm they have approval to issue certs on the new domain (I don't think this one ever got added to the matrix, we just discussed verbally during the production test-cert process as an improvement to be made)
      * Two-Factor Authentication/OTP - this one has been on the feature matrix

*Other Items*

      * Robot Certs -- I understand we're all set there and there are no outstanding questions/issues - just wanted to confirm
Additional Test Certs -- I understand those have either been issued or are in process via Jim - holler if you have any questions
      * Publicly Trusted SSL Certs -- Regarding the 30-ish standard SSL certs that OSG may need, I couldn't locate any notes on how many domains are covered in that estimate - apologies if you sent that over and I didn't capture it - but if you can kick that over to me I can determine if we can aggressively get you taken care of - which we'd like to do if we can - at this point it will be better to just execute a completely separate (and simple, standard) agreement for those rather than muddy the waters of the grid cert main agreement
      * 30-Day CRLs -- we met internally and discussed it last week and since the grid-related certs aren't publicly trusted, moving to 30 days was not a problem; I just confirmed with our tech folks that this update has already been completed
      * CNs for First Issuance -- I haven't yet connected with Scott on this one, so I'll punt to him to be prepared with an update tomorrow (for our call or via email update)
