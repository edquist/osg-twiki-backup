---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesOctober30][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  Vanderbilt is running jobs again; the site was down. Overall things are improving. Buffalo (GRASE) is trying to figure out why jobs aren't running there, but they're looking into it.

   * *This week*:   

2) A reminder regarding Super Computing planning
   *  Rob is putting together a [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/meetings/sc06.php][schedule]] of presentations.

3) New VORS is in development at http://vors-dev2.grid.iu.edu  
   * Send comments or bugs to the GOC.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG usage spotlight on LIGO

2) GADU's large job run
   * "There are three tools to be run, each tool is divided into approximately 40K jobs each running for about ~ 2 1/2 hours. I am expecting this run to take atleast a month, if not more. My target is to maintain more than 1000 running jobs as consistently as possible. Along with OSG, I will also be using Teragrid sites in this run." -Dinanath
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/gaduvo/gadu_jobs.cgi -- number of jobs running or jobs in queue at each site used
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/sulakhe/cgi-bin/site_selection_new.pl -- total number of sites from OSG and Teragrid that GADU has access to and their status for tests

---++ OSG RA Items

---++ Pending Registrations

   * VO *Engage* and its SC: *Engagement*
      * EB has given approval for both.

   * Resources : *Geneseo*
      * Production CE. Supported by GRASE.

   * 2577 - Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID
       * Related to the requirement to use voms-proxy-init at Fermilab sites. Adjustments were made at Fermilab to allow some nanoHUB jobs to run but work was still going on. What's the status?
