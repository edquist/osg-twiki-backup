---+++ Tickets to discuss on call:
 
      | GOC ticket | Support Center | Action/Summary | GOC Assignee |
      | 4167 | CSC | CEMon NOT installed at UNM_HPC. *Dan says 0.6.0 is now installed. He is working on the timezone problem (it's one hour behind).* | Tim | 
      | 4248 | GROW | GROW Support Center Contact Update. *Awaiting Update from new GROW contacts at UIOWA* | Tom | 

---+++ Other issues

1. Fermilab/USCMS <-> GOC ticket exchange

Tony at Fermilab has been working on Remedy (Fermilab/USCMS) <-> Footprints (GOC) ticket exchange. One scenario where a ticket in Remedy could be orphaned from a Footprints ticket. If "Is this ticket ready to be closed?" is not set to "Yes" the FP ticket is resolved, but the Remedy ticket is not. A future meeting will be scheduled so that the ticket exchange can be configured for greater efficiency.

- *Nothing new. A meeting is pending, but likely not until after the 0.8.0 release.*
