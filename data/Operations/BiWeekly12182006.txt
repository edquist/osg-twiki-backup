#OperationsMeetings
---++ Operations Weekly Meetings </h3>

   * *nanoHUB Report* Vanderbilt activity is increasing. The gatekeeper is back up. Jamie Frey helped them bring it online. They're still holding nanoHUB down to about 20 jobs due to a very high load average issue that is yet to be resolved.. UNM issues with authorization were resolved. Steve said that nanoHUB could use the support of at least a couple of sites to run more of their jobs. So GROW did agree to accept the jobs at GROW-UNI-P, per Eric. BNL was only offering 10-20 slots, so nanoHUB has opted to not run jobs there too. BNL did suggest running the jobs on STAR machines, perhaps 10 to start with, but they will be lower-priority jobs. If the results are satisfactory, he can submit more at their site.
   * On December 11th there was a followup on the deprecating grid-proxy in favor of voms-proxy. Dan Yocum had sent email to osg-general and the Executive Team detailing several reasons favoring this change. Dan attended the meeting to go through those points and answer any questions. The initial troubleshooting meeting followed the Operations Meeting, so the discussion was continued there. Minutes from that meeting can be found [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/MinutesDec4][here]].
   * December 4 VO spotlight on NWICG. Their gatekeeper is up. Purdue will bringing machines online soon. Scientists are just now lining up to use the OSG. They have a process defined and are now issuing certs. We also addressed the issue of tickets that have been routed to the VO, but have gone unanswered. Kevin Colby later identified the issue, located the missing mail, and is working on the submitted requests.

#SupportTickets
---++Support Tickets and Issues </h3>

---+++ LIGO
   * 2820 - Sites not supporting outbound connections from workernodes
      * Security concerns are the main reasons which sites choose to restrict the outbound connections. Some sites are interested in some http proxy technology like Squid that will allow these connections. From the CE you can't tell if outbound or inbound connections are supported. Leigh is following up with USATLAS to see if a small set of services can be enabled to allow Atlas jobs to execute correctly and to understand how much data is transfered at this point of the job execution.

   * 2785 - Request availability of SRM client v 1.25 (critical update request, CriticalUpdateSOPv2)
      * Stalled. We are awaiting word from Timur regarding a srmcp 1.25 which can run with the installed java version for OSG 0.4.1 sites.
