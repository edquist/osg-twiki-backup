---++ Operations Last Week

   * BDII instability event on 26/Nov. The problem was traced back to a IP renumbering project which had unforeseen affects on our internal DNS and LDAP. As soon as the issue was identified, the maintenance was stopped and service was rolled back to the pre-maintenance configuration. 
   * OIM outage 14:30-18:36 29/Nov. Tomcat failed without generating a log entry. Tomcat restarted, service is running.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/10/goc-service-upgrade-tuesday-october_19.html][Production release]] service upgrade announcement
   * First top level BDII at the GOC meeting, a draft [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/rept.pdf][proposal document]] is here.
