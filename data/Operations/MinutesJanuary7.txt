      | 4248 | GROW | GROW Support Center contact update; have not heard from the "new" GROW contacts (Jun and Boyd at UIOWA) _GOC will call again.

---+++ Other issues

1. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server status
   * Georgetown is upgrading their data center so their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is down at the moment. They hope to be back up in the next day or so.
   * Horst will followup on the Dosar VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS status, as it is also down at the moment.

2. GIP data filter on BDII ITB Interoperability. Fermilab will be testing with FERMIGRID_ITB. This filters out unwanted Glue attributes that are sent to the GOC's aggregator.
