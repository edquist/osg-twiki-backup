---++ Becoming a OSG PKI Registration Authority Agent or Grid Admin

   * Review training materials (TBD)
   * Open a GOC ticket with a request
      * For Grid Admin, specify the domain for which you wish to be authoritative (e.g. dept.iu.edu)
      * For RAA, specify the VO for which you are authoritative
   * Accept Trusted Agent agreement
      * TBD: How
   * Ticket is routed to OSG RA
      * OSG RA is operating under authority delegated from the OSG Security Officer
   * RAS/GA privileges are granted in OIM
      * By OSG security officer?
   * For GA, domain must be registered with DigiCert as domain OSG can issue certificates for
      * Through MPKI, directions pending
   * Requester notified and ticket closed
      * Ticket serves as audit record.

---++ Annual Maintenance of Role

   * Each year RAAs and GAs must confirm they wish to remain a RAA or GA
      * See https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-76
      * Seems like a good time to take refresher training as called for by DigiCert RPS (5.3.4)
      * Can we do this as part of normal OIM refresh? https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-108
   * If GA revokes role, we should de-register domain with DigiCert
      * Through MPKI, directions pending
