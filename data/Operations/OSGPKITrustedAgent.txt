---++ Becoming a OSG PKI Trusted Agent (Registration Authority Agent or Grid Admin)

   * Review training materials (TBD) and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/OSGPKIAgreements/DigiCert-OSG_Agent_Agreement.pdf][Trusted Agent Agreement]]
      * RA Agents are authoritative for issuing user certificate for a VO or site.
      * Grid Admins are authoritative for issuing host and service certificates for a site.
      * Requesting RA Agents and Grid Admins must be registered with OIM.
   * Check the list of current RA Agents (tbd) and [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/gridadmin][Grid Admins]] and coordinate with any existing Agent or Grid Admin for the VO or domain you are requesting privileges for.
   * You will need a valid certificate that is registered in OIM
   * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][Open a GOC ticket]] with a request as follows.
      * All requests are assumed to be for the OSG Production PKI, if you also want privileges for the Test PKI, please state so.
      * For Registration Authority Agent, please enter the following:
<verbatim>
Dear OSG PKI Operations:
I [Name] will be acting as an Agent of the Registration Authority for [VO/site]. I have been authorized by [VO/site] to represent them for the purposes of approving/revoking DOEGrids certificates in our community. I have read and agree to the following clauses:
1.	In acting as the Agent of the RA for [VO/Site] I have read, understood and accept the responsibilities and tasks assigned to an Agent as laid out in the Trusted Agent Agreement: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/OSGPKIAgreements/DigiCert-OSG_Agent_Agreement.pdf
2.	I understand that OSG will notify me by e-mail of changes to CP/CPS, and I will immediately notify the OSG if I am no longer willing to act as an Agent for my RA under any new CP/CPS.
3.	I understand that failure to fulfill my responsibilities and tasks under this agreement may result in the termination of my appointment as an Agent for [VO/site].
4.	I agree only to act on enrollment requests associated with the [VO/site].
5.	I understand that I am responsible for the revocation of certificates that are suspected of being compromised or issued in violation of the DOEGrids CP/CPS policies.
6.	I understand that I am responsible for customer support for our [VO/site] related to DOEGrids certificate issuance, revocation, and information.
</verbatim>
      * For a Grid Admin, please enter the following:
<verbatim>
Dear OSG PKI operations:
I [Name of new Grid Administrator] would like to be a Grid administrator for [site]. I would like to be authorized to request and approve OSG certificates for the following name space(s):
   a.	FQDN 1 or range of addresses for a particular domain (e.g., *.vo.opensciencegrid.org - please be as specific as possible)
   b.	FQDN 2
   c. Others.
1.	As the Grid Administrator for [site], I have read and understand the responsibilities and tasks assigned to a Grid Administrator as laid out in the Trusted Agent Agreement: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/OSGPKIAgreements/DigiCert-OSG_Agent_Agreement.pdf
2.	I agree that as Grid Administrator I will only submit and approve Service certificates for the FQDNs listed above.
3.	I understand that I am responsible for the revocation of certificates that are suspected of being compromised or issued in violation of the OSG policies.
</verbatim>
   * The Ticket will be routed to the OSG RA
      * OSG RA is operating under authority delegated from the OSG Security Officer
   * Assuming approval, the OSG RA will grant privileges are grant privileges in OIM
   * For Grid Admins, new domains will need approval from DigiCert via [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php][the MPKI Domain Manager]]
      * The OSG RA should wait until the domain is approved before proceding.
   * OSG RA will annotate and resolve the ticket, which will serve as OSG's audit record.

---++ Annual Maintenance of Role

   * Each year RA Agents and Grid Admins must confirm they wish to remain such and re-affirm their commitment to OSG PKI policies.
      * Seems like a good time to take refresher training as called for by DigiCert RPS (5.3.4)
      * Can we do this as part of normal OIM refresh? https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-108
   * If a Grid Admin declines to continue and OSG has no other Grid Admin for the given domain, the OSG RA should remove the domain via  [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/domain-manager.php][the MPKI Domain Manager]]
