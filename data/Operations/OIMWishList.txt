---++ Bug fixes/Errors - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.
 
   * Make "add a new person/group" have same constraits as person (no duplicate email address) 

---++ Immediate - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.
   * _B_ ug in maintenance submission form: Abhishek somehoe managed to submit maintenance records that had 0000:00:00 00:00:00 as the end_time; so we need to have: 
      * one validation (and possibly more) that ensures the end_time cannot be < start time. 
      * another validation that ensures someone cannot setup two overlapping maintenance records for the same resource-service mapping 
   * Bug in edit_resource form - if someone chooses "Default/fake" facility and site, and then tries to go back to edit a resource, they get a foreign key constraint or some such - I don't know what's going on but I can replicate the error if you need me to -- AG. 
   * Finish validation of Person Name and Resource Name, etc. 
   * Finish Quick Links section on OIM home page -- to include view/edit and maintenance links (where applicable) for resources, VOs, SCs, added contacts. Arvind has put together a prototype for this on the dev server. Consider creating pop-up page if number of resources > N. Use icons/images for view/edit/maintenance links. 
   * "Core Infrastruce Service" Resource Type. This should come with some grouping of resource types. 
      * Compute Element 
      * Storage Element 
         * SRM v1 
         * SRM v2 
         * Bestman/Xrootd 
         * !GridFTP 
      * Core Infrastructure Service 
         * VOMS 
         * GUMS 
         * Other VO Service 
         * Other Infrastructure Service 
 

---++ Short term Timeframe

   * Checkboxes to select resource types. 
   * Edit_AddedContact: For added contacts, can you slip in a "None - no DN associated with this user yet, contact GOC if you'd like this user to become active on OIM" type message? next to the Certificate DN: <blank> row 
   * Web Form to send email to goc@ 
   * Web form so that any registered OIM user can send email to any list. (osg-general, osg-sites, etc) 
   * Edit_Person: Display all updated user info once user is updated 
   * resource/resource.php: Does not show anything in site if the "Default site" is chosen .. it'd be nice if you showed some off-colored text that said "appropriate facility and site" are not assigned to this resource -- contact GOC, blah blah.. 
   * [[UdateEmailTemplates][Update Email Templates]] 
   * Add signing to all OIM correspondence. 
      * add an email form so GOC can send email to any OIM user. 
   * Edit all persons (admin) interface should show DN of person in each row -- ideally, the page would show name, email, phone, DN in some sort of tabular format. 

---++ Medium term Timeframe

   * ADMIN-Resource -- Allows me to activate a resource even though: 
      * it does not have a proper facility/site associated with it. 
      * it does not have the required contacts in it yet. 
   * Is the primary, secondary, etc contacts automatically generated? I.e if a particular contact has more than 2 contacts, then will a tertiary contact section show up automatically? 
   * Add Instant Messenger contact information to people registrations. 

---++ Long term Timeframe
   * In the Registration -> Resources -> My Resources menu, the resource names get cut short, and is hard to choose if two resource names are almost alike. 
      * display all resources that are registered to you in a table. same for contacts, sc, vo, etc. instead of in menus, which will cause trunctation. 
   * Secure Web Pages access based on Security Contacts listing 

---++ Done (please include timestamp)

   * Admin - edit resource gives me a 404 -- it's looking for resource.php.php -- should be an easy fix? - 2008-5-23-12:3O 
   * Edit/Display Resource/VO/SC pages need to show current active/inactive status .. and resoruce page should also show Status (ie up/ down maint, etc.) - 2008-5-23-16:50 
   * Edit_Resource -- we should not allow an admin to choose a random site while editing a resource; they should only be able to choose a site within the chosen facility. If they want to change the facility itself, then we (GOC) will have to do it OR we could add functionality to do that too.. - 2008-5-23-16:50 (GOC Admin users do have the ability to select any site. Normal users do not) 
   * inactive_list.php: lists no one (I guess because I made everyone active for contacts purposes in the DB ) -- there's a really tiny link in that empty page which when I click, says "An email has been sent to: ... " [empty string]. This page should show anyone who does not have a DN irrespective of whether or not they are an active OIM person. - last week, forgot to move it 
   * edit group contacts: expects first and last name ... should only expect one name ... and removed middle name - June 4, 2008 
   * Edit person page should allow switching between group user and person user .. at least for GOC staff. There's a CMS Tier1 user right now in both groups. - June 4, 2008 
   * add toggle for active/inactive for person group - June 4, 2008 
   * Add SC information to Resource stuff on Admin interface. Also should be for resource page, I think. - June 4, 2008 
   * We need to be able to remove contacts, and not just change... (of course there will be ramifications.. for example a resource will become inactive if its primary required contacts is removed.)(we will use an oim-deleter user sometime here, but for now oim-updater) - June 5, 2008 
   * Added all of Arvind's mail messages and notification messages sent in the pdf - June 5, 2008 
   * Add/Edit_Resource: We're allowing selection of any resource as parent ... you should only allow resources in a particular site (chosen) as parent resource -- important validation we'll need RSN if not today. June 6,2008 
   * Add or display time registration was originally submitted, as well as last updated date/time.- Done July 8, 2008 
   * Scheduled Maintenance Summary Page - Done AG July 4 2008. 
   * Fix error (again) that makes the same person selectable for primary and secondary contacts.Done (Will be totally revamped when new contact system is created)
