---++ Bug fixes/Errors - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.
   * inactive_list.php: lists no one (I guess because I made everyone active for contacts purposes in the DB )  -- there's a really tiny link in that empty page which when I click, says "An email has been sent to: ... " [empty string]. This page should show anyone who does not have a DN irrespective of whether or not they are an active OIM person.
   * edit group contacts: expects first and last name ... should only expect one name ... 
   * Edit person page should allow switching between group user and person user .. at least for GOC staff. There's a CMS Tier1 user right now in both groups. 
   * We need to be able to remove contacts, and not just change... (of course there will be ramifications.. for example a resource  will become inactive if its primary required contacts is removed.)
 

---++ Immediate - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.

   * Allow a "NONE" selection for a contact.  (ie, a way to remove a contact without contacting the GOC)
   * Add/Edit_Resource: We're allowing selection of any resource as parent ... you should only allow resources in a particular site (chosen) as parent resource -- important validation we'll need RSN if not today.  (Added by Kyle: holding on this as Rob says this might be a possibility with virtual sites/facilities)


---++ Short term Timeframe

   * Edit_AddedContact: For added contacts, can you slip in a "None - no DN associated with this user yet, contact GOC if you'd like this user to become active on OIM" type message? next to the Certificate DN: <blank> row
   * Edit_Person: Display all updated user info once user is updated
   * resource/resource.php: Does not show anything in site if the "Default site" is chosen .. it'd be nice if you showed some off-colored text that said "appropriate facility and site" are not assigned to this resource -- contact GOC, blah blah..
   * [[UdateEmailTemplates][Update Email Templates]]
   * Add signing to all OIM correspondence. 


---++ Medium term Timeframe

   * ADMIN-Resource -- Allows me to activate a resource even though:
      * it does not have a proper facility/site associated with it.
      * it does not have the required contacts in it yet.
   * Is the primary, secondary, etc contacts automatically generated? I.e if a particular contact has more than 2 contacts, then will a tertiary contact section show up automatically?

---++ Long term Timeframe
   * In the Registration -> Resources -> My Resources menu, the resource names get cut short, and is hard to choose if two resource names are almost alike.


---++ Done (please include timestamp)

   * Admin - edit resource gives me a 404 -- it's looking for resource.php.php -- should be an easy fix? - 2008-5-23-12:3O
   * Edit/Display  Resource/VO/SC pages  need to show current active/inactive status .. and resoruce page should also show Status (ie up/ down maint, etc.)  - 2008-5-23-16:50
   * Edit_Resource -- we should not allow an admin to choose a random site while editing a resource; they should only be able to choose a site within the chosen facility. If they want to change the facility itself, then we (GOC) will have to do it OR we could add functionality to do that too..  - 2008-5-23-16:50  (GOC Admin users do have the ability to select any site.  Normal users do not)
   * inactive_list.php: lists no one (I guess because I made everyone active for contacts purposes in the DB )  -- there's a really tiny link in that empty page which when I click, says "An email has been sent to: ... " [empty string]. This page should show anyone who does not have a DN irrespective of whether or not they are an active OIM person. - last week, forgot to move it
