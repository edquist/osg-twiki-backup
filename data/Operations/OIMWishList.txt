---++ Bug fixes/Errors - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.


---++ Immediate - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.

   * Edit/Display  Resource/VO/SC pages  need to show current active/inactive status .. and resoruce page should also show Status (ie up/ down maint, etc.)
   * Add/Edit_Resource: We're allowing selection of any resource as parent ... you should only allow resources in a particular site (chosen) as parent resource -- important validation we'll need RSN if not today.
   * Edit_Resource -- we should not allow an admin to choose a random site while editing a resource; they should only be able to choose a site within the chosen facility. If they want to change the facility itself, then we (GOC) will have to do it OR we could add functionality to do that too..

---++ Short term Timeframe

   * Edit_AddedContact: For added contacts, can you slip in a "None - no DN associated with this user yet, contact GOC if you'd like this user to become active on OIM" type message? next to the Certificate DN: <blank> row
   * Edit_Person: Display all updated user info once user is updated
   * resource/resource.php: Does not show anything in site if the "Default site" is chosen .. it'd be nice if you showed some off-colored text that said "appropriate facility and site" are not assigned to this resource -- contact GOC, blah blah..
   * [[UdateEmailTemplates][Update Email Templates]]


---++ Medium term Timeframe

   * ADMIN-Resource -- Allows me to activate a resource even though:
      * it does not have a proper facility/site associated with it.
      * it does not have the required contacts in it yet.
 

---++ Long term Timeframe
   * In the Registration -> Resources -> My Resources menu, the resource names get cut short, and is hard to choose if two resource names are almost alike.


---++ Done (please include timestamp)

   * Admin - edit resource gives me a 404 -- it's looking for resource.php.php -- should be an easy fix? - 2008-5-23-12:3O
