---++ Bug fixes/Errors - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.




---++ Immediate - ASAP Timeframe -- in order of decreasing priority.
   * Finish validation of Person Name and Resource Name, etc.  

---++ Short term Timeframe

   * Checkboxes to select resource types.
   * Edit_AddedContact: For added contacts, can you slip in a "None - no DN associated with this user yet, contact GOC if you'd like this user to become active on OIM" type message? next to the Certificate DN: <blank> row
   * Web Form to send email to goc@
   * Web form so that any registered OIM user can send email to any list. (osg-general, osg-sites, etc)
   * Edit_Person: Display all updated user info once user is updated
   * resource/resource.php: Does not show anything in site if the "Default site" is chosen .. it'd be nice if you showed some off-colored text that said "appropriate facility and site" are not assigned to this resource -- contact GOC, blah blah..
   * [[UdateEmailTemplates][Update Email Templates]]
   * Add signing to all OIM correspondence. 
      * add an email form so GOC can send email to any OIM user.
   * Edit all persons (admin) interface should show DN of person in each row  -- ideally, the page would show name, email, phone, DN in some sort of tabular format.

---++ Medium term Timeframe

   * ADMIN-Resource -- Allows me to activate a resource even though:
      * it does not have a proper facility/site associated with it.
      * it does not have the required contacts in it yet.
   * Is the primary, secondary, etc contacts automatically generated? I.e if a particular contact has more than 2 contacts, then will a tertiary contact section show up automatically?

---++ Long term Timeframe
   * In the Registration -> Resources -> My Resources menu, the resource names get cut short, and is hard to choose if two resource names are almost alike.
      * display all resources that are registered to you in a table.  same for contacts, sc, vo, etc.  instead of in menus, which will cause trunctation.

---++ Done (please include timestamp)

   * Admin - edit resource gives me a 404 -- it's looking for resource.php.php -- should be an easy fix? - 2008-5-23-12:3O
   * Edit/Display  Resource/VO/SC pages  need to show current active/inactive status .. and resoruce page should also show Status (ie up/ down maint, etc.)  - 2008-5-23-16:50
   * Edit_Resource -- we should not allow an admin to choose a random site while editing a resource; they should only be able to choose a site within the chosen facility. If they want to change the facility itself, then we (GOC) will have to do it OR we could add functionality to do that too..  - 2008-5-23-16:50  (GOC Admin users do have the ability to select any site.  Normal users do not)
   * inactive_list.php: lists no one (I guess because I made everyone active for contacts purposes in the DB )  -- there's a really tiny link in that empty page which when I click, says "An email has been sent to: ... " [empty string]. This page should show anyone who does not have a DN irrespective of whether or not they are an active OIM person. - last week, forgot to move it
   * edit group contacts: expects first and last name ... should only expect one name ... and removed middle name - June 4, 2008
   * Edit person page should allow switching between group user and person user .. at least for GOC staff. There's a CMS Tier1 user right now in both groups.  - June 4, 2008
   * add toggle for active/inactive for person group - June 4, 2008
   * Add SC information to Resource stuff on Admin interface.  Also should be for resource page, I think. - June 4, 2008
   * We need to be able to remove contacts, and not just change... (of course there will be ramifications.. for example a resource  will become inactive if its primary required contacts is removed.)(we will use an oim-deleter user sometime here, but for now oim-updater) - June 5, 2008
   * Added all of Arvind's mail messages and notification messages sent in the pdf - June 5, 2008
   * Add/Edit_Resource: We're allowing selection of any resource as parent ... you should only allow resources in a particular site (chosen) as parent resource -- important validation we'll need RSN if not today. June 6,2008
