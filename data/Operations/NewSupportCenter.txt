<a href="http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=69">registration page</a> and
do so.  Remember that as a Support Center you have an obligation to respond to and resolve issues that get routed to you; in return, you get to send issues to other Support Centers and ask them to resolve
issues on your behalf.  If this seems like too much commitment, %RED% mention CSC %ENDCOLOR%
