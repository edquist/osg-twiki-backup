---+++ Gridex VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration
This VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is for Gridex application to run on production OSG, it has been running on ITB.  There is no reason to object from TG Support Centers and there is clear membership in OSG so Operations should proceed with preparing the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package update.

---+++ Provisioning
Burt - going reasonably smoothly, may have release out end of the week<br>
we noticed a possible cache corruption for the old 0.2.1 that caused the nightly install test to fail that is being investigated.
