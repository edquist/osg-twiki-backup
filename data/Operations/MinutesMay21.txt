---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesMay14][previous meeting]]

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO Spotlight on Engage

One research group active over 150 CPU hrs in a few weeks. About 4 other projects are in the pipeline and it's difficult to say when those projects will take off, but hopefully in the next 6 weeks, the majority being serial jobs. One is going to be a resource provider and consumer. Current app is a protein analysis app...submit a large number of jobs and come up w/prefidications of proteins, go back into the lab to analyze the data, then run more jobs, typically a week or so at a time. Increased support is needed (around 300 jobs at once) goal is around 500. 12 sites currently successfully support Engage, which are also running 0.6.0 and not 0.4.0. No additional support is needed from the operations group at this time.

2) DZero Production Run Update

95% complete. They're doing a lot of clean-up with the errors they've received during the run.

3) OSG Mailing Lists
