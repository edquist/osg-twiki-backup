---++Purpose
This Twiki page is for site admins to share the various tricks they have
learned in setting up Condor batch systems to work with the Open Science Grid
---++Hardware configuration
*  It is strongly recommended that your condor master (i.e. the machine 
that runs daemons condor_collector and condor_negotiator) be a different machine
than the machine which is your Open Science Grid gatekeeper.

*  It is also strongly recommended that the machine which runs condor_collector and condor_negotiator
not be a busy NFS file server.

---++Software configuration

*  Although the OSG Compute Element install will give you a condor batch system 
as part of the install, it is better to install it separately. This way you will be able to upgrade
the condor independently of the rest of the VDT.  Condor typically has new versions
a lot faster than the VDT does.

*  By default condor ships with open HOSTALLOW_WRITE, which means anyone
in the world can join your condor pool.  This is a potential security hole and you need to 
close it as soon as possible.  There is no reason for OSG functionality to do this.
