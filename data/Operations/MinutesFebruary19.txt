---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesFebruary12][previous meeting]]

No followup items were discussed.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo spotlight on mariachi (John Hoover is not available due to the Government Holiday)

2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/NANOHUB_UtilStatus

   * *Last Week* Issues have been resolved at UNM, so the ticket can be closed.  Also Vanderbilt's problem was figured out.  Purdue's problem has not been figured out.  One file will not transfer, haven't figure out why.  Looks to perhaps be a Globus issue, but haven't heard back.  UNM's problem was in PBS.pm.  Local customization was incorrect.  Vanderbilt's problem was a similar issue.  The log files were filling up ...a patch messed up the files, so the jobs couldn't run because the log files couldn't be found.

   * *This Week*: The last few jobs are running: Purdue, Chicago and Vanderbilt. Having trouble with some jobs where files won't return the data back to nanoHUB. There are no errors with any substantial error codes. Jaime Frey with the Condor team has filed a ticket with Globus on the issue.

3) DZero Production Run Update

   * After a 2-week run they've seen several problems, with efficiency at about 50%. They're not getting the CPUs at USCMS, which is the bottleneck. 500-1000 nodes available to them. They're getting about a million events per day, but would like to get about six million. Burt asked Parag to call him if necessary to work through the jobs failing to run at USCMS.

4) Request for increased support of Engage and GROW and DZero

   * No representative from Engage. For GROW, the throughput is about 500 CPUs at once, maximum was 700. A 5-day run is upcoming, so after that DZero will have a report. They're running at Fermilab now, which has added a lot of CPUs, and GROW wasn't running there before.

---+++

   * *2577*  Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID - Fermi/Remedy - 91402
      * GOC will ping Fermilab again.

---+++ USCMS 

   * *2978*  Authentication error with srmcp at MIT - Fermi/Remedy - 90584
      * The customer has been unresponsive. Closing.

   * *3099* Fermi/Remedy - 92729 CE failure on cmslcgce.fnal.gov (USCMS-FNAL-WC1)
      * There was some question regarding the timeline from creation of the LCG ticket > GOC > USCMS. 

---++ Other issues

None.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

No issues.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments & Plans

---+++ Site Admins Group

   * What site specifications are necessary to run DZero production jobs? Merging jobs?
      * Outgoing connectivity
      * 6-8GB of scratch space on the local worker node.
      * ~24 hour runtime, although one job ran 40 hours.

   * Storage Element reporting by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS

http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_results?grid=1

All scans fail, but that is because the critical tests have yet to be defined. There is talk of building this into the site_verify script.
