---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG VO spotlight on mariachi (John Hoover is not available due to the Government Holiday)

2) Large resource request for !nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus

   * *Last Week* Issues have been resolved at UNM, so the ticket can be closed.  Also Vanderbilt's problem was figured out.  Purdue's problem has not been figured out.  One file will not transfer, haven't figure out why.  Looks to perhaps be a Globus issue, but haven't heard back.  UNM's problem was in PBS.pm.  Local customization was incorrect.  Vanderbilt's problem was a similar issue.  The log files were filling up ...a patch messed up the files, so the jobs couldn't run because the log files couldn't be found.

3) DZero Production Run Update

4) Request for increased support of Engage and GROW and DZero
