---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Upgraded GOC Production Factory to use Condor 7.8.2
   * Upgraded UCSD Factory to use Condor 7.8.3
   * Made condor 7.8.3 tarballs available for glideins to use on ITB however Tim discovered 7.8.3 glideins fail on startup on the WNs
      * We are still investigating and will hold off making them available in production until it gets resolved.
   * Discovered that glideinWMS 2_6_1 Frontends only work with 2_6_1 Factories.
      * Requested a special upgrade window for Tomorrow Sept 18, 10 am - 11 am (PDT) to get the GOC Production Factory upgraded right away.
      * Notified all Frontend admins who are thinking about upgrading to 2_6_1 to wait until after the special upgrade window.
