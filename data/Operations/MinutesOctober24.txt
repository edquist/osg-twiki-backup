---++Support Centers Roundtable
USCMS - Nothing
Fermilab Kerberos CA is expired. Dan will send mail. He is also talking to VDT about this.
ATLAS - Nothing
---++Other Issues
---+++GLOW VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Addition
There will be a new VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package soon including this VO.
---+++Users in Multiple VOs
If you use gridmap file it does not map correctly. Based on the first in file. This is a weakness in the software. GUMS doesn't enhance this, so it would be reasonable to request policy state that a seperate certificate for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo they use. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS - does this watch for expired certificates, it suspends user. GUMS will not recognize multiple DNs mapped to different VOs it just throws the extras away. This may be more of an implemetation issue.
---+++Fork job manager being removed from VDT
This would break gridcat and other workflow managers. Possibly other applications. Software installation would be affected.
