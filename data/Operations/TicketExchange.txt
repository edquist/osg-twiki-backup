It has been requested that the GOC ticket exchange system be modified to allow attachments
to tickets to be propagated with a ticket when it is exchanged between ticketing systems.
It is sufficient to propagate the attachment once and not required that it accompany every
update. Any ticket system may initiate a ticket with an attachment and all systems must
be able to receive them. The mechanism for propagating an attachment is unspecified.
