BNL has requested that the a new feature be created in the GOC ticket exchange system to allow attachments to tickets to be propagated along with a ticket when it is exchanged between ticketing systems.
   * Any ticket system may initiate a ticket with an attachment and all systems must be able to receive them. 
   * It is sufficient to propagate the attachment once and not required that it accompany every update.
