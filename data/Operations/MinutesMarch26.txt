---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesMarch19][previous meeting]]
 
---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) VO spotlight - OSGEDU

There was a grid workshop in Chicago (!MidWest Grid Workshop) which comprised of 60 students. More information about the education and outreach program can be found under the Education TWiki Web. There are three scheduled workshops this year. The OSGEDU VO is used for testing as part of this program. Users are added to the VO temporarily for the purposes of the workshops. ITB members are encouraged to enable the OSGEDU VO to support the outreach and education project, but production sites should not. The next workshop is in Brownsville, TX in late May.

2) DZero Production Run Update

They submit an executable to every node and the throughput is currently very slow. Sites that have local storage will be hosting the executable, which they believe will speed up things. Some jobs are waiting several hours for CPU time. But the sites on OSG are working much better. Troubles that they are encountering are being directed to the OSG Trash/Troubleshooting group. DZero's goal is 3 million events per day and they're around 2 million currently.

3) Recent security issues announced for Tomcat & !MySQL
   * Email with information was sent last week to Support Centers and site administrators.
      * Discussed. No questions.

---++ OSG RA Items

No items. We did briefly discuss a recent request for a CEmon http service request for nanoHUB.

---++ Pending Registrations

None.

---++ [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/tickets][Tickets]]

---+++ USCMS

3218  FTS transfer - Transfer problems between sites USCMS-FNAL-WC1 and CERN-PROD
   * Updates by yujun@fnal.gov and Jon Bakken lacked any data. GOC checked the Remedy ticket, but saw no updates from either of them. Can the updates be entered into Remedy and copied to the GOC please?
      * Burt said that updates have to go in a specific area of they'll be excluded in the Remedy ticket. Rob and Burt will followup w/Linda and Marc today. Rob is at Fermilab and will be meeting with them later.

---+++ CSC

3258  Site failing critical site_verify tests - UNM_HPC
   * It has been failing authentication and no response has been received by the GOC. What is the status of this site?
      * No attendee from UNM. GOC will ping them again.

---+++ USATLAS

3256  UC_ATLAS_MWT2 site admin contact info update
   * The site admin's email address bounces.
      * Update received. New contact information will be added shortly.

---+++ Fermilab

2577  Fermi/Remedy - 91402 - Nanohub job failures at FNAL_FERMIGRID
   * Still debugging. Not seeing the VOMS attribute correctly. It is actively being investigated.

---++ Other issues

None.

---+++WLCG/OSG/EGEE Issues

1) GOC working with them on SAMS service availability monitoring so we can have some cross-project reporting.

2) A duplicate field in BDII was causing problems with WLCG. The GIP script is allowing new lines to end up in some of the fields, causing a problem. Burt is trying to duplicate it on his ITB site. It may be a version-dependent problem because John Weigand's site doesn't have this difficulty.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments & Plans

---+++ WLCG interoperability

See item #2 under WLCG issues.

---+++ Support Center Attendance
