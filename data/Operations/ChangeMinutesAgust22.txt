-- Main.ScottTeige - 17 Aug 2011

---+++ Announcements
   * Network outage rendered all services unavailable between 16:15 and 18:35 EDT, 16/Aug.


---+++ Accounting issues associated with the outage
   * All services, including monitoring continued to run through the network outage
   * Reported availability/reliability numbers do not reflect the actual availability/reliability of the services
      * We can add status change records to appropriate DBs
      * We can add a footnote to the monthly report

---+++ Glidein factory SLA
   * Changes are of 3 types:
      * Changes to non-data.These include condor code, glideinWMS code and validation scripts used by the glideins at various sites. These are subject to the usual change management processes.
      * Changes to meta-data. Examples of these include disabling a decomissioned or misbehaving CE, adding a new CE on a already supported site, changing the max_walltime of the glideins, removing a VO from the site whitelist, adding a new site, adding a VO to a site whitelist, re-enabling a site that was misbehaving in the past and enabling glexec at a site. It is of the nature of the service that these changes must be made as needed and the risk associated with each change will be left to the best judgement of the service administrators. Changes involving adding new resources, VOs, re-enabling sites or execution methods will follow standard change management policies.
      * Changes to data. These are automated and reflect the state of the grid. They allow efficient scheduling of jobs and are not subject to change management of any kind.
   * The glidein ITB instance will point to production resources. Minimally invasive test jobs ("Hello World") will be executed via the MIS front-end to insure the functionality of the factory. After any changes to the ITB instance, stakeholders will be invited to test using the instance.
   * The UCSD instance will serve as the development instance of the service. If an "experimental" resource implemented there is shown to be workable, it will be implemented on the ITB instance and tested before moving to the production level.
   * Operations Lead, currently Scott Teige, will serve as primary point of contact. Changes not clearly of a routine nature or clearly covered by change management will be made in consultation with the Operations Lead. Problems effecting the status of the service will be communicated here.  Operations lead will provide communication to the community and escalate notification as appropriate.
