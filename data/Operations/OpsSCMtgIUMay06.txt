---++ Tentative agenda outline

| *Tuesday, May 16* |  Description  |  Who  |
| 9-noon  | full attendance and video: ||
|| Discuss: OSG operations distributed model (see doc [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=47][47]]), what it means to be a support center, expectations/procedures/etc. (perhaps toward developing a best practices guide for new Support Centers) | |
| 2pm-6pm  | two sessions ||
| | Session one:  handling User questions | |
| | Session two:  registrations, GOC services, resource monitoring, etc. (SC training on OSG common services) | |
||||
| *Wednesday, May 17*  | ||
| 9-noon |||
| 2-6pm (4pm?) | Create a document describing GOC procedures and policies, and policies and procedures for each VO. This would be become the OSG support plan document for 2006-2007?  | |

 The security handling would be from the perspective of
 the support center. 
	1. keeping the security information current.
		  (current doc suggests a monthly "ping")
	2. formation of the 2nd tier support as is being drafted in
		  the new security doc from Don Petravick.
