This page is for development requests for the GOC Services.

   * Display Squid Information for Sites
   * Displace Gratia Information (#3460)
      * Message from Chris Green:
Hi,
 
Now that Gratia reporting is a requirement for OSG0.6.0, we'd like to be able to have VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS show
the last-seen date for Gratia probes for each site. There is a URL for this purpose: please see
http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration/monitor-status.html?sitename=FNAL_GPFARM (or equivalently http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8881/gratia-
administration/monitor-status.html?sitename=FNAL_GPFARM_TEST for ITB sites). Ideally, sites
would be able to tell at a glance whether their probes are operating).
 
This page can also respond specifically to probename (eg http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/
gratia-administration/monitor-status.html?probename=condor:fngp-osg.fnal.gov) but I think the
sitename variant is more appropriate for GOC's purposes.
 
I'd be grateful if you could contact us to discuss feasibility and next steps.
 
Thanks for your time,
Chris Green for the Gratia team.
