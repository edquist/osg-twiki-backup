---++ RPM Release and Repository Discussion
   * Last week during production release 
      * A repository was enabled and newer versions were found and used. RSV reports did not work correctly.
      * Rolled back and all is well, no other services effected.
      * Procedure modified so this will not happen again.
   * Do we need an "official" repository?

---++ BNL downtime problems resolved
   * Multiple issues caused the problem
      * Downtime description field limited to 500 characters at SAM
      * One record was an update SAM would not accept resent record (duplicate key)
   * Discussing fix for 500 character limit now. Certainly fixed in next version (~6 months)

---++ Hosting Gratia Display at the GOC
   * Production, ITB and Development VMs allocated

---++ Puppet memory issues (caused Display downtime)
   * have implemented alarms on all ITB instances monitoring puppetd memory use
   * have slowed the leak to <1% of total machine memory per week (Smallest memory machines)
   * will change puppet mode of operation to eliminate problem (cron vs. daemon)
   * currently reviewing memory use alarms

   * Ready very soon, current priority.
