---+ Deployment Plan for Top Level WLCG BDII Service

---++ Preliminary Working Group Report

The preliminary workgroup produced a report located at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1021. 

---++ Request Documentation 

The request by the WLCG is recorded in tickets [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9893][9893]] and [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9892][9892]].

The presentation by the WLCG Information Officer to the WLCG Management Board is located at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LCG/WLCGISArea/BDII_Deployment_Plan.pdf.

---++ Introduction and Purpose

The WLCG Information System is used to discover services and get status information about WLCG resources. It is important to ensure high reliability of the WLCG Information System Service to support the LCH experiments. To insure this high availability the service must have a critical level SLA defining emergency and after hour procedures. To ensure this availability to a worldwide community the WLCG has deployed a plan to run 12 geographically dispersed services. The OSG has offered to run this service for BNL (USATLAS) and FNAL (USCMS). 

This document will set forth a plan outlining the steps necessary to procure hardware, install the OS and Service software, and bring the service online as a production level critical service.
