Tomcat is very hungry,it likes to eat memory.  There are tomcats now in the canonical VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server installation and the canonical
GUMS server installation, and soon to enter the compute node too with the advent of CEMON.  First law of Tomcat:
Throw hardware at it.  You cannot have too much RAM.
