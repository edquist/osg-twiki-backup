      * !GratiaWeb metric only available part of the week

      * Attempted transition to Oasis2 caused two copies of oasis-replica to be running simultaneously, one responded to RSV, the other  did not.
      * repo1 failed Friday night, rebooted Saturday morning
         * failed again this morning, rebooted. Suspect interference from perfsonar data store 
<!-- RQ: psds1 started stealing CPU at the same time repo1 crashed. It also swaps all the time, there is idle time on the CPU plot, unused on the memory plot. -->
