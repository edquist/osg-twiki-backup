---+ RSV WLCG SAM Equivalences

This page expands on availability (a.k.a critical) metrics for various OSG services in the WLCG Sam/GridView availability calculations. The SAM team maintains [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/OSGCriticalProbes][a similar page for their reference]]. This list is used by the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RsvSAMGridView][SAM/GridView system]], the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/MeasurementsAndMetrics/RsvReportsOverview][RSV reporting system]] as well as [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/resources][the central RSV status interface]].

---++ Computing Element (CE):

   * CE-sft-caver is equivalent to org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry 
   * CE-sft-csh is equivalent to org.osg.general.osg-directories-CE-permissions 
   * CE-sft-job is included in org.osg.general.osg-version 
   * CE-sft-softver is equivalent to org.osg.general.osg-version [Should this be org.osg.general.vo-supported ? -AG] 
   * CE-host-cert-valid This one does not apply for OSG (no way to check) 
   * CE-sft-brokerinfo This one does not apply for OSG (no broker) 
   * This is not available in EGEE in OSG org.osg.general.ping-host 
   * This is not available in EGEE; in OSG org.osg.globus.gram-authentication 

---++ Storage Element (SE):

   * These do not apply to OSG as they only have SRMs 
   * SE-lcg-cr 
   * SE-lcg-cp 
   * SE-lcg-del 

---++ SRM (SRM):

   * SRM-put is equivalent to org.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite 
   * SRM-get is equivalent to org.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite 
   * SRM-advisory-delete is equivalent to org.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite 
   * This one does not apply to EGEE ; in OSG org.osg.srm.srmping 

---++ CE/GridFtp (GridFtp):
   * CE-sft-lcg-rm is equivalent to org.osg.globus.gridftp-simple 

---++ Site BDII (sBDII):

   * Does not apply as OSG only uses a global BDII. A future release of RSV will include Global BDII tests. 
   * sBDII-sanity 
   * sBDII-performance 

---++ Critical Tests for OSG Resources

---+++ Critical Tests for OSG-CE Service

   * org.osg.general.ping-host 
   * org.osg.globus.gram-authentication 
   * org.osg.general.osg-version 
   * org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry 
   * org.osg.general.osg-directories-CE-permissions 
   * To be added on a date not confirmed yet: org.osg.batch.jobmanager-default-status 
   * To be added on a date not confirmed yet: org.osg.batch.worker-node-status (a job manager metric that tests end to end from CE to worker node)
   * To be re-added on a date not confirmed yet: org.osg.certificates.crl-expiry 

---+++ Critical Tests for OSG-SRMv1/SRMv2/BestmanXrootd

   * org.osg.srm.srmping 
   * org.osg.srm.srmcp-readwrite 

---+++ Critical Tests for OSG-GridFtp
   * org.osg.globus.gridftp-simple 

---+++ Critical Tests for top level BDII
   * sBDII-sanity 
   * sBDII-performance
