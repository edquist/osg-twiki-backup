   * Upgraded SDSC Factory to glideinWMS v3_2 (pre-release) and HTCondor to 8.0.2.
   * Discovered HTCondor-G bug that affects submission to cream and nordugrid sites if using OSG rpms for globus libraries.
      * nordugrid_gahp processes were stuck in busy loops, hogging cpu
      * Jaime Frey provided a patch and it will get into HTCondor 8.0.4

      * glideinWMS developers provided a patch and it will be put into official v3_2 release.
