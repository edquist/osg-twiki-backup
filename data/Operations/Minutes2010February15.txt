---++ Operations This Week
   * *LHC*: Return to data collection; watch for tickets, etc. with wide-open eyes!
   * *Gratia Accounting service moving to new hardware on Thursday, Feb 18 2010 (Time??)*
      * Data collection and DB updates will be suspended to allow a copy of the live DB. Reports will still be available at this time, but obviously will not include data not received. This procedure is expected to take 4-6 hours, during which time,  data will be backlogged by probes and sent when service resumes.
      * On Thursday, Feb 25 2010 (Time??), the migration will occur. Since this will involve a migration of service IPs to the already set-up and operating new systems, the outage for each service is expected to be under 5 minutes barring unforeseen circumstances. Any probes attempting to contact during this time will backlog the data and re-send as before upon resumption of service. In addition, Gratia proposes to retire the unused "GRATIA-ITB-OSG-PERM" service at this time. 
   * *GOC-TX*
      * With USATLAS RT: Further ongoing testing .. No ETA yet on move to new system because of production upgrade freeze
      * With FNAL Remedy: Continue new web service based GOC-FNAL ticket exchange work once GOC gets FNAL system access
   * *GOC Debian repo*: If LIGO testing succeeds, then deploy CA-dist 1.11 to production 
   * *Internal System Improvements*: GOC will continue working on improvement monitoring its own services, etc. through this month
