---+ Operation Impact of PKI to OIM

---++ Define Change to Service

The current scope of OIM is as a topology database and defined formally in the document located at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMScopeDef. This change assesses the impact to the OIM service by adding PKI mechanisms within OIM for providing x509 certificates. 

The current SLA for OIM is located in the document at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMServiceLevelAgreement.

---++ Key Differences in Service

Under the proposed change OIM will be used to provide a front-end for requesting !DigiCert x509 certificates. This will be a modular add-on to the OIM service and not interfere with existing functionality as a topology database. 

It will impact Contact (User) data. The proposed change will connect the user registration to the !DigiCert DN. Thus at the time of requesting a cert the user will be registered as a Contact in OIM. The PKI front end will also add the !DigiCert signing server as an additional dependency to OIM. OIM will function without this dependency but will not issue certificates. 

Due to the importance of user credentials in the OSG this change will also increase the priority of the service to OSG. OIM is currently considered a "Normal Priority" service. This change will give it priority over Normal Priority services, but does not include after hours support. 

The change will also create certificate request tracking within the existing ticketing system. 

The elevated priority of the service will require that it operate on redundant servers similarly to MyOSG and BDII. Operations servers are currently hosted
in a single rack in the Bloomington machine room. This rack is at its rated power capacity. Either the current rack must have a power upgrade or
the additional servers must be located in a new rack. Both options are available but upgrading power in the existing rack will entail a significant and
possibly unpredictable downtime of all Operations services. Adding an additional rack will incur a marginal expense associated with instrumenting
it for remote console access.

---++ Effects of Key Differences

Contact (user) registration is now tied to obtaining OSG credentials. 

If OIM fails users will not be able to request new certificates. 

If the !DigiCert signing service fails OSG users will not be able to request new certificates. (This will have a larger impact to OSG overall, but not to OIM.)

More physical machinery along with standard services is required (network, power, cooling, etc.)

---++ Impact of Change

Upgrading service priority will include more effort from both Support Desk and Engineering.
