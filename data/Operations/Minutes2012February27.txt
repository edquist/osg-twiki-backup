---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * Investigated outage between GOC-TX and !ServiceNow.  Both S. Timm and A. Tiradani are now on !ServiceNow integration list which means we will get a heads-up from further WSDL changes.  Support model still under discussion with !ServiceNow maintainers to work with Axis and other Java-based services.
   * GOC ticket 11711, a spam ticket about hair extensions, was opened via ticket.grid.iu.edu and forwarded to !ServiceNow on Sat. 2/25.
   * Gratia operations investigation discovered a !MyOSG bug that wasn't sending email to contacts that didn't have DN's, will that be fixed in production release this week?
   * Gratia total VO count now stands at 87, down from a max of 564.  Much of it traced to misconfigured PBS and LSF sites.  Patches already made available for Gratia PBS in osg 1.2.27, in progress for LSF.
