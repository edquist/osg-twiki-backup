---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Upgraded ITB Factory Condor to 7.8.3
   * UCSD participated in Site SecurityTeam Challenge 6 (SSC6).
      * It mostly required effort from the CMS VO Frontend side, and no action was required on the Factory level.
      * We remained ready to ban the CMS Frontend or blacklist submission to particular sites, but it was not requested.
      * We can still dig through glidein log files if the CMS Frontend operator (James Letts) needs it for forensics.
