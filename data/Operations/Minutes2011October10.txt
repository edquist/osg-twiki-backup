---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * On Wed. Oct. 5 we discovered a serious glideinWMS bug where glideins were not respecting retire times.
      * This allowed glideins to run indefinitely on sites.
      * We put the GOC Factory in unscheduled down time and notified Scott due to it being high priority.
      * We first applied a patch to UCSD and when we were sure it fixed the problem we patched the GOC factory and brought it back up Thurs. morning Oct. 6
      * We removed all glideins from before the patch to ensure there are no more long running glideins.
