---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesOctober22][previous meeting]]

   1. Security Incident with CDF at CNAF

No evidence has been seen that anyone tried to use the certificates that were on the machine, plus those certificates have now expired.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo spotlight on GROW

Anand will work on locating who is the manager of GROW VO. We'll reschedule for a future VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo spotlight.

2. OSG version 0.8.0 release and upgrade plans

Release planned for next Thursday, November 1. FNAL plans to install the release on five gatekeepers with the other machines following within a week. Sites running 0.4.x will be removed from monitoring and registration if they have not upgraded by the start of next year (2008). So encourage these sites to upgrade.

---++ OSG RA Items

No items.

---++ Pending Registrations

None.

      | GOC ticket | Support Center | Action/Summary | GOC Assignee |
      | 4155 | USATLAS | New Resource, GLOW-ATLAS, has not passed site_verify since being registered. Status? | Tim |
      | 4167 | CSC | CEMon NOT installed at UNM_HPC. *Dan says 0.6.0 is now installed. He is working on the timezone problem (it's one hour behind).* | Tim | 
      | 3986 | fGOC | LIGO can't run jobs at your LIGO-supported resource: FIU_PG *Rob will take this up with the admin.* | Rob |
      | 4258 | USCMS | CMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server is unavailable. Status? *They have people working on it.* | Tom |

      | 4253, 4264, 4266 | CMS and nanoHUB | Each reported a problem with the GOC that VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS isn't reporting the correct information for Resources supporting those VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's. It is a known issue, but investigation has been halted while GOC prepares 0.8.0 services. | Tim |
      | 4255 | NERSC | Shreyas should be a security contact for the NERSC Resources. | Kyle |
      | 4254 | NERSC | NERSC admin wants to access the site admin tool. Kyle will use the admin's DN to authorize. | Kyle |

---+++ Other issues

1. Fermilab/USCMS <-> GOC ticket exchange

Tony at Fermilab has been working on Remedy (Fermilab/USCMS) <-> Footprints (GOC) ticket exchange. One scenario where a ticket in Remedy could be orphaned from a Footprints ticket. If "Is this ticket ready to be closed?" is not set to "Yes" the FP ticket is resolved, but the Remedy ticket is not. A future meeting will be scheduled so that the ticket exchange can be configured for greater efficiency.

- *Nothing new. A meeting is pending, but likely not until after the 0.8.0 release.*

2. Syslog project underway at the GOC.

3. Glue Schema update last week was completed and Burt and Rob have seen no issues.
