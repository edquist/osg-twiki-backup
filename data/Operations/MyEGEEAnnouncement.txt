*MyOSG Adopted by EGEE*

At EGEE ’09 in Barcelona, the EGEE SAM group based at CERN announced 
the adoption of the !MyOSG presentation framework for MyEGEE.

!MyOSG (myosg.grid.iu.edu), developed at Indiana University, is an 
information consolidation and presentation web tool used to create 
custom user views from several OSG data sources. These include 
information data as BDII and GIP Validation, monitoring data gathered 
by Resource and Service Validation (RSV) Probes, accounting data from 
Gratia, and administrative data from the OSG Information Management 
(OIM) database.  

The idea for !MyOSG came from listening to the OSG Community during 
face-to-face meetings. "Many OSG Resource Providers were telling us
there were too many different websites to visit to keep track of their 
Resource status." says Rob Quick, the Operations Coordinator for 
the OSG. "We needed a service to consolidate OSG information."
These included separate addresses for accounting, health, and 
information used for job level decision making, and information validation, 
plus other Virtual Organization contributed dashboards.

"While we were planning !MyOSG, we realized there was another 
fundamental problem with existing information presentations services
and dashboards, they gave you views of all of OSG, and there were 
as many different responsibility sets as there were people in the OSG."
continues Rob. "When an OSG collaborator told me the history of 
Grid Monitoring was littered with thrown away dashboard projects, I
knew we had to think of a different approach." 

!MyOSG selection criteria allow each user to have a unique view of 
content gathered from multiple sources within OSG. It also allows 
export into a generic widget format (UWA) to personalized workflow 
environments such as iGoogle, !NetVibes, and other widget viewers 
including mobile devices.

After collaborating with EGEE as a peering grid and participating in
interoperability monitoring groups to meet the Worldwide LCG 
requirements, it was decided that EGEE would adopt !MyOSG. "We 
adopted a standardized messaging format from EGEE based on 
this collaboration, now they are adopting a presentation layer from us."

EGEE prototyped MyEGEE along with updates to their overall Service 
Availability Monitoring (SAM) infrastructure update that also 
consists of Nagios monitoring components. A SAM presentation can be 
seen at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PADq2x8q0kw.

contribute a quote here as why they choose !MyOSG. %ENDCOLOR%
