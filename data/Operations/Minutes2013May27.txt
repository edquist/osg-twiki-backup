---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Slowed busy cycle down on GOC factory to prevent disk from filling.  This is a temporary solution until we upgrade to gwms 2_7_1.  Load should be more evenly distributed between GOC and other factories after upgrade.
   * Enforced glexec requirement at factory level for all opportunistic VO pilots going to FNAL sites.

---++ Operations This Week


---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Plan to upgrade GOC factory to use glideinWMS 2_7_1 on Tuesday's production window.  We expect this to improve ongoing load and memory issues.
   * Plan to make 64-bit HTCondor the default for glideins from all factories.  UCSD has run with 64-bit as default with no issues for the past two weeks.
