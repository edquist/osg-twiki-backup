---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly24][previous meeting]]

1. OSG RA Item: A bug was discovered in the cert request script. The name of the person wasn't being passed to the site, and that data is required. Persons using the scripts should update to the latest versions.
   * The GOC sent email to the Support Centers about this last week.
2. Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing)

3. Reminder: End of life announcement - USCMS VO at Fermilab - Today
---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. Gridscan certificate update.
   * The new DN is /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Leigh  Grundhoefer (!GridScan) 274052  The VO membership is MIS.

---+++ OSG VO
   * Site administrators should review VORS and verify that their sites listed support the OSG VO.
   * Ruth has recommended we have a procedure for the OSG VO that if someone does not use the Grid for 3 consecutive months their certificate is revoked from the VOMS server --- they can of course easily be added back in.
