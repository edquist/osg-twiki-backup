      * Information Services:
         * OIM: Topology database; used by many services; registration databases; direct SQL queries exist from the BDII; web interface for querying still exists. Developed by OSG operations and owned by OSG. 
         * MYOSG: is an information aggregator of which one source is OIM. 
            * what is the answer to the users who ask for 1 place to get information about sites. Is this BDII or MYOSG? Official answer is the BDII. Does MYOSG have state information or does it rely on other databases exclusively real time? 
         * Status of the Discovery Service: is in the OSG User Client. Not documented? As of our "new definition" this is not yet released. XML version of Glue. RESS is a classad version of GLUE.
