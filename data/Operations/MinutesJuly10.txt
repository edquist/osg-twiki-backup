iVDGL and PPDG have been running the Grid Registration requests and now we have started up the OSG RA since those projects will be going away. When problems or issues come up those items will be discussed at this meeting. Web pages with this information isn't ready yet, but it is being developed. Doug will contact VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's to get contacts/agents to process the requests. Wednesday afternoon the Renewal link will not work, as changes are implemented.
