---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly23][previous meeting]]

Retirement of the OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS at IU. https://iggy.uits.indiana.edu/~tsilver/data_file lists to which VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS sites are connecting. The OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS at IU will be retired at the end of August. GOC will be notifying sites that are still using the IU VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS soon. A recent VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package will get these sites updated to refer to the OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS at Fermilab instead of IU.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. New VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Package with SBGrid and LIGO update

   Added SBGrid and there's a change in the port for LIGO in the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS file.

2. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Reporting Issues Being Investigated

   If you select a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you will usually see a list of Resources supporting said VO. However, there is an update that is not occurring and the GOC is investigating this issue. A couple of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's reported this to the GOC and there are tickets open regarding the issue.

---++ Open Technical Discussion of the Operations Group Developments & Plans

1) CE and GUMS running on the same machine (GOC ticket 3918)

MIT has done this, but they're upgrading and planning to stop the use of this setup. Unless the site is quite small, it is not recommended that you put anything on the gatekeeper but the CE. Justin's site (SMU) is a small Tier 3 site for USATLAS with 20+ computers. Alain Roy from the VDT says that it does run on the same machine, but for scalability, it is best to put it on a separate machine. There was some misunderstanding by Justin because he had thought GUMS was required in order to use PANDA, but Horst confirms that it is not; a grid-mapfile will be sufficient with PANDA.

---+++ WLCG interoperability

   * WLCG Collaboration workshop September 1-2 2007, Victoria, BC, Canada (co-located with CHEP 2007)
