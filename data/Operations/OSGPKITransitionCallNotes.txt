      * Try to map each phase to roughly a week.
      * Should we add an OIM form for opening a ticket to request becoming an TA? If we want to make a workflow out of it, then this is just a first step. Soichi suggest a middle ground as a start to a TA workflow management system - couple days to a week.
      * We should do this.
      * AI: Soichi should open JIRA ticket to track OIM interface to request RA/TA.
      * Will need multiple RAs for VOs (e.g. CMS VO). Allow for multiple secondaries.
      * Soichi will target having ticket opening part available by Sep 11. Will then use Phase 1. 
  * Validation of Subject Alternative Names
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-145
      * DigiCert is taking SubjectAltName from CSR, what vetting should we be doing?
      * What does DOE Grids PKI does? We don't know. Do we use them?
      * AI: Von to send email to Mike H. and Diva and ask about SubjectAltName policy.
      * Seems like we haven't using SubjectAltNames in DOE Grids PKI today.
      * User certificate should have RFC 822 for email address.
      * Host certificate should have DNS name and email address.
        * X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:
        * DNS:pepperjack.fnal.gov, email:kevinh@fnal.gov

   * OIM registration required for multiple user certificates: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-129
      * Resolved, yes this will be required unless we hear it is onerous. We expect it will be uncommon.

Ongoing tasks:
   * !DigiCert Update (Greg)
      * Dev team looking at code push for 13 mo validity on production CA. Should have gone to both CAs. Asking us to double check. 
      * AI: Soichi to double check. Jim B. got a 12 mo certificate today.
      * API update for user revocation planning on going live tomorrow. In QA process.
      * Other items in progress.
   * Web UI Development/Deployment (Soichi)
      * Another release next week; just release itb release - adding interface for searching certificates.
      * oim is working with production CA (12 mo due to other issue).
      * Should discuss certificate renewal process at a future time. What should happen to user/host certificate when renewal is requested? !DigiCert does not revoke old certificate. We should not revoke a renewed certificate. Soichi will send specific questions to the list and Von will add to agenda next week if needed. 
   * Software Acceptance (Alain R./Von/Rob Q.)
      * No major updates.
   * CLI tool development/packaging (Rohan/Von/Alain R.)
      * Change to tools - need to use '-T' for oim-itb.
   * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony)
      * Walking through the process of registering DigiCert DN in VOMS and making sure that propagates to sites.
      * John Hover has agreed to go through this process for ATLAS. Anthony is doing for VMS. (Reached out to LIGO, but they are not planning on using DigiCert CA.)

      * Start inviting a few folks to enroll as TAs following Alain and Von's processes above. Alain will being with support staff at GOC. Second wave would be other folks on this call. Third wave would be ITB folks. Then go to other keys sites - e.g. Frank Nagy.

---++ 14 Aug 2012

Attending: Anthony, Soichi, Chander, Rohan, Mine, Alain R., Rob Q.

New Action Items:
   * AI: Von to talk to Suchander about ITB being earlier tester of production certificates.
   * AI: We need to either change this behavior (reported by John Volmer) or provide guidance to user how to deal with this.

Agenda:
   * DigiCert update/issues (Greg)
      * Major issues:
         * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-128][Domains have expired at DigiCert]]
            * Resolved. Scheduling post-mortem on this with Greg and Rob
         * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-111][Certificate lifetime is not 13 months]]
            * Still open. Have pinged Greg for status.
   * Ongoing tasks
      * Update on Web UI (Soichi)
         * Today was release date, when well. Tested user certificate request with OIM and production API. Failed, has sent request to Greg to start troubleshooting process.
      * Software Acceptance (Alain/Von)
         * Had call on Aug 9 with Alain, Rohan, Soichi, Von -  focused on finishing up OIM and turning to command-line clients.
         * Went well, OIM needs documentation, otherwise looks good.
         * CLI identified needed documentaiton. Planning for more formal hand-off to software team.
      * Update on CLI tool packaging (Alain R./Rohan)
         * Rohan has ball to merge in to trunk.
      * Update on Python 2.4/2.6 testing (Von/Rohan): https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-41
         * Have access to FermiCloud.
         * osg-cert-request seems good on 2.4.
         * Hit an issue with osg-cert-retrieve: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-126 
         * osg-gridadmin-cert-request pending.
      * Update on DN transition testing (Jim/Anthony)
         * Anthony has been out the last week.
      * Communications (Ruth)
         * On vacation.
      * ITB testing - should we repeat the ITB testing from the planning phase?
         * Should ITB be a early adopter of the OSG PKI?
         * In planning phase we worked with Suchander - he seems to be point.
         * AI: Von to talk to Suchander about ITB being earlier tester of production certificates.
      * Update on Contingency analysis and plan (Mine): http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1115
         * Sent to ET last Friday, have heard no feedback yet.
         * Chander has read - 2 Qs: Do you know of any other major team that has put a contingency plan for a PKI in place? How much resortation can we accomplish by restoring a fraction of the users certificates - is that a reasonable strategy? Fill follow up with Mine on Thursday.
         * Mine contacted CERN CA (back in June) - they don't have a contingency plan, as they think they have enough redundancy place to recovery quickly (in 1-2 weeks). FNAL KCA has similar thoughts.
      * Operations Impact (Rob): https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
         * Added information requested by Ruth - added estimated FTE. Is available.

         * No change in last week.
      * Training (Mine): https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/DigiCertTrainingPlan
         * This is activity ramping up now contingency plan is done drafting.
   * Other business?
      * John Volmer: Requesting multiple personal certificates onto desktop. Interface seems require a unique email address for each certificate request.
         * Approaching OIM anonymous, always requires unique email address. So one is required to authenticate with cert in browser to obtain multiple certificates?
         * Is this what we want? This is not the way things have worked before.
         * Users may not load certificates into browsers otherwise.
         * What should a user do if they run into this?
         * AI: We need to either change this behavior or provide guidance to user how to deal with this.
         * E.g., user requesting certificate before certificates expired.
         * We are expecting users to authenticate with certificate in browser if they have it.

      * Will have something done in next couple of weeks so training can be done.
   * RA Enrollment/Maintainence Process (Von) - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OSGPKITrustedAgent
      * Still half-baked.
   * FYI: Software Acceptance - scheduling second call with Alain R., Rob, Soichi and Rohan (Von)
      * Goal is to complete Web UI testing from July 23 (see call notes on this page) and start process for CLI
   * Update on CLI tool packaging (Alain R./Rohan)

      * ACTION ITEM: We should settle names before packaging. (DONE)
      * ACTION ITEM: Script should look in /etc/ and ./ for configuration file (maybe /etc/osg/?) (https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-95)
   * Update on Python 2.4/2.6 testing
      * Pending: Von has FermiLab account, needs to talk to Steve T.
   * Other business?

---+ 31 July 2012

Attending: Tony, Chander, Greg, Alan D., Von, Mine, Rohan, Alain R.

Agenda:
   * Command-line tool updates (Rohan)
      * Tony confused by purpose of command-line tools. Expecting ability to request a single hostname without separate approval step. Found names confusing, suggests dropping 'multi'
      * Asked about how to issue service certificates - should be able to specify <svc>/<fqdn>, but it seems to be broken at the moment: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-93
   * Action Item round up:
      * Von to send out email to next rounds of testers.
         * DONE
      * Von to review https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact
         * PENDING
   * Greg update on Roadmap - August 22nd at latest, client revocation code will be live.
      * Can we get documentation head of time? Yes, Greg.
   * Contingency Analysis (Mine)
   * Deadline for revocation API (Soichi not on call, discussion off-line)
   * What is motivation for python 2.4 support? RHEL5 which common, also Scientific Linux 5
      * Rohan and Von both using macs which doesn't play well with Python 2.4 - can we get access to a RHEL5 machine
      * FermiCloud is one option, or Alain has some old hosts, or use a VM. FermiCloud would allow direct testing of RPMs. Alain would supply link for Fermi account, then talk to Steve T.
   * Packing of CLI tools
      * Goals: RPMs - RHEL5 & variants, RHEL6 & varients, Scientific Linux is the most common variant. OSG SW3 is all RPM-based.
      * What else do we want to support? Older release is OSG 1.2. That version is not RPM - it is all PacMan. Have told people we are not doing updates, ship updates rarely. Do we want to provide a 1.2 release as well? For PacMan need a usable tarball - what is a usable tarball? M2Crypto is already an RPM, but is extra effort for PacMan.
      * Would need tarball for CLI clients, and then tarball for M2Crypto. Also SWIG is needed.
      * Nothing we described doesn't sound like something Alain
      * Can we decide not do do 1.2 packaging? Anthony says CMS would be fine without 1.2 packages.
      * There may also be other machines  - non-RPM, non-PacMan. Could just point them at source repository? RPM gets us 90%.
      * There is also always the Web Interface, between it and the source repo, it seems to be covered.
      * DECISION: We will be doing RPM only until someone complaints.
      * Two possible issues for packaging - configuration file shared and one python file imported by all scripts. Both are static. Configuration file should be looked for in standard places and same with python files.
      * We do not need to patch m2crypto any more.
      * Alain will drive packaging.
      * ACTION ITEM: Would like 'make dist' that creates versioned tarball.
      * Does RPM contain both new and DOE Grids scripts? Yes is the decision.
      * ACTION ITEM: We should settle names before packaging.
      * ACTION ITEM: Script should look in /etc/ and ./ for configuration file (maybe /etc/osg/)
      * What should script find module? we will use PYTHONPATH

New Action Items:
   * Von to review https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact

Agenda:
   * Action item round up
      * Von: Publish notes from XSEDE CA meeting to doc db
         * DONE: http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1114
      * Von to send out email to next rounds of testers.
         * PENDING
      * Von to ping Rob re Operations document
         * DONE: Ready for review
   * Command-line script for certificate approval - no need or previous script has been found - final call.
   * Software acceptance testing (Von/Alain)
      * See notes for 23 July 2012 
      * In summary, Alain and Von both comfortable with where OIM is at
      * Command-line clients pending
   * Notes from development meeting (Von/Soichi/Rohan)
   * Updates from DigiCert (Greg)
      * Moving forward with name-space issue with user certs (adding O=Open Science Grid), timeline by end of day or tomorrow, along with finalized roadmap
      * Status update with Soichi, in next sprint.
      * Gathering information
      * Will use cert revocation be included? Greg will double check.
   * Status of Web UI (Soichi)
      * Going well, Alex S. helping test, small changes. Getting close to releasing OIM with production version of certificate interface with hidden menu, but able to issue real certificates. Will be able to serve production CLI.
   * Status of command line UI (Von/Rohan)
     * Major block was API for multi-cert script. Have minor things left. Bulk cert request ready soon.
     * How close are we to packaging these? Let us try to start this after next week's call.
   * DN Change testing (Jim/Anthony)
      * Anthony got a certificate yesterday, didn't have O=OSG, waiting to hear timeline before deciding to proceed or wait. Would like to have final DN before proceeding.
      * Could we start issuing real certificates to friendly users in August? Von doesn't see why not, as long as RA load isn't too high. Soichi: should set up proper RA structure when we do this.
   * Update on items from https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase
      * Operations Impact https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact (Rob)
         * See above.
      * Iterations Document (Von)
         * Von has proposal for MPKI interface. Mine: Can security team have back up? Yes, all can have delegations.
      * Contingency Plan (Mine)
         * Goal of document is "how does OSG survive 3 months until a permanent replacement CA is set up?"
         * Looking at options for restoring all certificates versus a subset of certificates; IGTF and non-IGTF options; meeting with external CAs (NCSA and NERSC) who could support us during a contingency period - both would involve us creating accounts for OSG users manually and then they could get short-lived certificates from their respective MyProxy CAs.

---+ 23 July 2012 (SW acceptance call)

Attending: Alain, Soichi, Von

Action Items resulting:
   * Soichi: For Section 2, item 5: Finish documentation such that a second developer could maintain OIM
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-70
   * Von: For Section 2, item 7: If possible,  investigate automated webapp security tests for OIM.
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-71
   * Soichi: Soichi will send Von URL and screen shots of logs for approval (4.2)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-72
   * Soichi: We should check DNs and lifetimes, and alert GOC staff if we see something unexpected (but not error out) (4.4 and 4.5)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-73
   * Von: Is there off-site (non-Bton data center) backup? (5.1.1)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-74
   * Von: Do we need to limit Trusted Agents to use of DigiCert certificates? (6.2)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-75
   * Von: Under the old system, reach TA/GA had to renew their rights each year with certificate renewal. Was this purposeful? (no specific section)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-76
   * Von: Define process by which someone becomes a RA/GA (7)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-77
   * Soichi: Change warning to 50%, critical to 75%. (8.1.2)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-78
   * Soichi: Need to add checking of user's email domain. (8.3.1)
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-79 (9)
   *  Soichi: Private key deletion should be implicitly or explicitly logged? Can we overwrite private key with noise? Or are we at mercy of GC?
      * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-80

Notes:
   * Working through this https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-PKI-Acceptance-Criteria-2.docx
   * Just focusing OIM, will do with client tools later
   * Section 2, MUSTS:
      1 All GOC software is Apache v2
         * Should make sure this is stated somewhere in the source code.
         * Goal here is that OSG has access to software if IU leaves consortium
      2 Version scheme: protocol has a version
      3 Test suite: Have a few unit tests, not comprehensive. Access control requirements makes testing hard. Most testing is 'friendly user' testing.
         * Have a testing period on ITB is acceptable.
      4 End-user documentation: in the case of OIM this is the web pages itself
      5 Internal developer documentation:
         * This is a bigger concern, how would a second developer come up to speed? How is it build and deployed?
         * Alex D. has been added to OIM development
         * We have: https://docs.google.com/a/vonwelch.com/document/d/1-noGy__JKaXP218k3jxtlbl--iuOUCNarL5vBDbxbSk/edit#
         * Result: some work need to be done here to document built processes.
      6 Source code repository with versioning scheme: use subversion, branch every release
      7 External code review:
         * This is more applicable to CLI, since SW team will be taking this over.
         * We don't have expertise to do this for OIM (javascript, other web technologies) on OSG SW team.
         * Should we do webapp testing for OIM? We should at least do low-hanging fruit. OWASP.
         * MIST is an option, but would need to be resourced.
         * What about GUMS, VOMRS developers? Doesn't seem likely they have spare cycles.
         * Alain is fine with state of affairs here for OIM.
      * With exception of completing documentation for item 5, Alain is happy with section 2.
   * Section 2, SHOULDS:
      1 Use community software: Not applicable.
      2 Widely-known technologies: Acceptable
      3 See 5 above.
      4 See 7 above.
   * Section 3:
      * These items are pending, have ITB testing coming up.
   *  Section 4:
      * 4.1: Approval: DONE
      * 4.2: Auditing: This is all in OIM logs, via OIM-log interface. 
         * AI: Soichi will send Von URL and screen shots of logs for approval.
      * 4.3: General format: DigiCert is generating certificates.
      * 4.4: DN form: DigiCert is responsible for forming the DN
         * AI: We should check DNs and alert GOC staff if we see something unexpected (but not error out).
      * 4.5: Certificate Lifetime: DigiCert sets this
         * AI: Augment above AI, we should check lifetime
   * Section 5:
      * 5.1.1: Integrity of Auditing: All OIM DB content is backed up to back up server, daily snaps shots for 60 days, backup server is backed up to tape.
         * AI: Is there off-site (non-Bton data center) backup?
      * 5.1.2: Protection from modification: is protected by usual mysql access controls and unix file system permissions. Access limited to GOC staff and limited by bastion host. Back ups provide extra protection.
      * 5.1.3: Any changes to auditing will be logged: no applicable, all database changes are logged.
      * 5.1.4: Any attempt to modify logs will be logged:  all database changes are logged.
      * 5.1.5: Time sycnhronizing: Run NTP, and monitor against 2nd second system to sanity check.
      * 5.2.1: Unexpected errors will be logged: Yes, are are forward to GOC service alert.
      * 5.2.2: Any violation of policy: We don't allow violations of policy, see PKI System Design Doc.
   * Section 6: Authentication
      * 6.1: Failed authentication attempts will be logged: We do certificate-based authentication, handled by Apache. Apache logs failures. We don't currently monitor.
      * 6.2: Trusted Agents shall be authenticated with valid DigiCert certificate: TA must authenticate. We currently accept any IGTF certificate for OIM. We don't currently enforce the use of a specific CA for TA.
         * TA role is bound to contact Id, one can map multiple certificates contact ID. We could implement TA as an authorization and force binding to a DN.
         * AI: Do we need to limit Trusted Agents to use of DigiCert certificates?
         * AI: Under the old system, reach TA/GA had to renew their rights each year with certificate renewal. Was this purposeful?
   * Section 7:
      * We don't currently have a defined process for this for the OSG CA. Should define a process where all of this is logged as a ticket, which becomes the audit record.
      * AI: Define this process.
   * Section 8:
      * 8.1.1: We have 3 limits - global for the entire OSG for year, user has an annual limit (3 user certificates, 1000 host certificates) , user has a daily limit for host certificates (50); these are administratively adjustable.
      * 8.1.2: Track and notify when certain levels are reached:
         * Have Munin plug-in to monitor number of requests: https://internal.grid.iu.edu/munin/ITB_VMs/oim-itb/cert_quota.html URL here.
         * 75% of threshold, 85% is critical and sends warnings on these levels.
         * Multiple thresholds are problematic.
         * AI: Change warning to 50%, critical to 75%.
      * 8.1.3: No longer a requirement. See https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-69
      * 8.1.4: See 8.1.1
      * 8.1.5: See 8.1.1
      * 8.2.1: Host Certificate Approvers of host certificates shall be Grid Admins: Implemented
      * 8.2.2: GA shall be restricted to a domain: Confirmed
      * 8.3.1: User email addresses must be in DigiCert.
         * AI: Need to add checking of user's email domain.
      * 9.1: Private key generation logging: Von will verify this when he verifies logging for item 5.
         * This is not explicit, private key is created when certificate generated, and when session expires.
         * Want to be able to answer question: what keys were on the system during a given time frame?
         * Private key deletion is tied to session expiration - is this logged? Not currently, but can be turned on.
         * AI: Private key deletion should be implicitly or explicitly logged? Can we overwrite private key with noise? Or are we at mercy of GC?
      * 9.2: Private keys encrypted with strength-tested pass phrase: Done.
      * Section 10: Host certificate revocation works today, user certificate revocation is pending support from DigiCert.
      * Section 11: Training and Testing:
         * We have this with OIM ITB.

New Action Items:
   * Jim to talk to Anthony re DN change testing
   * Von to check out new registration process from Soichi
   * Soichi create document with bulk host use case, what he is doing today, and what is.

Agenda/notes:
   * Introduction of Rohan Mathure who is coming on board at IU to take over for Jeremy.
   * Quick update from Von on Interactions Document.
   * Quick update from Jim on VO Transition
      * AI: Jim will follow up with Tony offline.
   * Quick update from Mine on contingency plans
      * Von and Mine met this morning, covering compromise or loss of OSG PKI.
   * Greg on any updates from DigiCert
      * Waiting on results from bulk-host testing. Requests have been put into dev-team.
      * We can get peek at their roadmap when it is sorted out.
   * Update from Jeremy on command-line scripts.
      * Sent out invitation to list to test CLI scripts. They are not packaged currently. Just check it out of subversion. There is a README and each script has '-h' option.
      * Packaging might be a day's work, Rohan will contact Alain when ready.
      * Please send issues to list or start a JIRA issue.
   * Update from Soichi on front-end and testing, bulk-host certificate request.
      * Updated registration process email - turning into a complicated process - dealing with a lot of corner cases (e.g. expired certificate, so unauthenticated, but has DN)
      * AI: Von to look at updated chart.
      * Have something slow for bulk-host, expect to improve it with better API.
      * Digicert doesn't have a clean way to get status on a requested certificate. We wait for 60 seconds, then every 5 seconds ask for a host certificate.
      * AI: Soichi create document with use case, what he is doing today, and what is.
      * Will be gone next week.
   * Discussion of duplicate host certificate issuance (email exchange with Anthony)
      * Von describes his proposal that host certificates have to be expiring or revoked to be reissued.
      * Anthony needs a grace period for changing over expired certificates. One month sounds reasonable. T1 is very concerned about downtime because they are contractually obligated.
      * Jim & Mine: concerned about disaster planning - need to encourage some overlap of certificates.
      * Soichi: Already have three limits (day, user, total) - do we need another limit?
      * Alain: Should we handle these a exceptions rather than policy.
      * Von agrees not to bake this into policy.
   * Other business?

Agenda:
   * Action items
   * Tasks on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase

Action Items:
   * Soichi to send out email when OIM-ITB ready for testing
      * Done: https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificate
   * Jeremy to send out email when CLI tools ready for testing
      * Pending on issue regarding delays in host certificate issuance

New Action Items:
   * Sort out renewal (???)

Notes:
   * Host certificate signing delays - Greg - had some configuration issues, has been fixed to threshold of a minute. Also discovered that our setting for batch certificates is hitting them every 5 seconds, which is putting a strain on their servers. Can we make requests about a particular certificate every ~30 seconds.
      * We need get Soichi to make changes on our side and then Jeremy. 
      * Soichi: We send up 50 cert requests, then start pinging. We are talking here the querying about certificates once requested.
      * Can we have a API call to request all the status at once?
      * What is the paradigm that DC would like it to use?
      * Can we wait 60 second before we make the first request? Then they should all be issued.
      * Is this a server dedicated to OSG? No. What will be the impact of other customers on our requests?
   * No other updates on other items, first one consumed all the time.
   * OIM-ITB is available for testing, Alex Sim has been testing and Soichi has been fixing a bunch of issues that he released just before the call.
      * Any unresolved complaints at this point? Certificate renewal is unclear.
   * Jim has looked at Transition testing, will be blocked until a production OIM certificate front end is available.
   * Draft Planning phase report is available: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Operations/DigiCertPlanningDevAndImplementation/OSG-Planning-Phase-Report-3.pdf

---+ 5 June 2012

Agenda:

   * Tasks on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase

Action Items:
   * Von to develop what it means for development to be complete and deployment to begin given our "devops" approach.
      * Done, on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase
   * Rob to complete Op Changes document.
      * In progress, Action Item changed to task on OSGPKIDevelopmentPhase
   *  Soichi to consider implications of possible delay in host certificate issuance and implications to design.
      * Added new API call "issue()"  - should be called until it returns success.
      * For Web UI, requestor precess "Issue" which then waits certificate issuance and then user can "download."
      * Could we just make request when GA approves and then notify user when it is ready to retrieve?
      * Von: OK to try this, but let's keep an eye on how this works in practice.
      * DONE.
   * Jeremy to send email to Greg on user certificate revocation to sort on confusion on API support for this.
      * PENDING: Jeremy just sent script, script was mean for host certificates, but also works for users, Greg is looking into it.
   * Soichi to send out email when OIM-ITB ready for testing
      * The interface is ready, haven't sent out the email - will sent accounts for them - what roles do they want - renewal and revocation not done.
      * Von and Soichi to work on this off list.
   * Jeremy to send out email when CLI tools ready for testing
      * All the individual action scripts are done, bulk done shortly.

Notes:
   * John Volmer - what does the RA interface look like - best to ask Soichi to test as RA.

      * DONE - item #36 https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OSGPKIProjectWBS
   * Mine to finish training document
      * Use OIM-ITB for triaining
      * Add reference to 5.3.3 of the OSG/DigiCert RPS
      * DONE

Notes:
   * Greg on DigiCerts issues:
      * Latency issues - normally only 1-2 minutes - anything above that is a technical glitch or trigger of a risk score, e.g. "microsoft.iu.edu", manual approval - human time 5-15 minute approval. Let him know if we see further issues.
         * Will need to redesign workflow for host certificate requests - need to request from DigiCert ahead of user request to retrieve for OSG.
         * AI: Soichi to think about.
     * Revocation for user certificates - API doesn't support client cert through API? Jeremy says it worked. We're confused here.
         * AI: Jeremy to send what he thinks does this to Greg to close the loop.
   * Alain: Would it help to start packaging things as RPM quickly?
      * Would be good to do sometime in June before Jeremy takes off. Jeremy will touch base with Alain when ready.
   *  Soichi update:
      * Wrapping up prototype for testing by others. Most of design doc items prototyped. Expect email middle of this week pointing folks to OIM-ITB with list of features that are expected to work.
   * Jeremy update:
     * Generating requests with user-ready code in Subversion in sandbox. Hope to have the rest of it up and running in the next couple of days. Will send out email later this week when it's ready for more eyes.
   * Von: Contract with DigiCert agreed to by all, expect execution this week.

---+ 22 May 2012

Agenda:
   * Focused development discussion

Notes:
   * Soichi has prototype already at OIM-ITB
   * We will plan on doing a iterative testing model with OIM-ITB and code that is available frequently to members of OSG-PKI email list (and others who are interested).
   * What is the relationship between software team and new PKI software?
      * OIM is not packaged or distributed - is available under Apache license from IU SVN - not public, but that's historical not by policy
      * There is precent for other services like this in OSG - e.g. RSL
      * General decision regarding OIM is that it stays where it is at, but SW Team has a role in ensuring it's quality.
      * Client tools are more clear - will be owned by SW team and replace DOE Grids tools in VDT.
         * There is an issue here of long-term support to work out.
   * During testing we will be using DigiCert Pilot CA, don't need to use full set of policies - do need someone to act as RA/GA - Von will as Alain D. to do so.
      * At some point we need to shift to full policies - at Deployment?
   * Soichi and Jeremy will announce on OSG-PKI list where software/services are available for testining.
      * Software for testing may be very raw - e.g. not have packaging for client software, testers expected to do 'svn co'
      * Soichi and Jeremy should make it clear what is expected to work.
      * Feedback may not be addressed immediately depending on prioritization - developing other features may be first.
   * Next major milestone is July 20th, Acceptance testining
      * Expectation is software is functionally complete per Acceptance Plan
      * May not have all the polish and user friendliness at that point
      * We will arrange meeting with Von, Alain R. and developers to review software per plan

New Action Items:
   * Von to ask Alain D. if he would be willing to serve as RA/GA during development testing.
   * Von to develop what it means for development to be complete and deployment to begin given our "devops" approach.

      * Why not register user in OIM as soon we get the user's contact information? Do we need to make sure the user gets their certificate first?
      * Renewal - don't revoke old certificate on renewal.
      * Renewal - should just re-key; getting new certificate into browser is part of it. Requires new use case for user-supplied CSR.
      * New ticket for each renewal instead of opening new ticket? Some VOs are interested in renewals.
      * Tag tickets differently for requests and renewals for each searching.

---+ 17 April 2012

Decisions:

         * Tasks now grouped into the following to match Chander's plan: Deployment and Development Plan, Training Plan, Communications Plan, Transition Plan, Contingency Plan, DigiCert Agreements
         * Next step: We need to assign a primary owner for each task and then work with that owner to get intervals for each task.
      * Jim and Von to talk to WLCG VOMS admins to determine policies on pre-loading (in progress)
      * Von to ping Keith C. as we haven't heard from him re Contingency Plan in a couple of weeks.

         * Von went through and commented on, topics to discuss:
            * Sponsors
               * Alain D: VO-manager will provide list of Sponsors for VO, most of the time. Sponsors not formally agreeing to something. They preferably have a DOE Grids Cert. An non-user can act as a sponsor, if need be.   
               * Sponsors do not have authority to issue certificates. 
            * Un-checked Grid Admin requests - concerns Von re typo on CLI app
               * Tony: GA must create a file with N hostnames.
               *  Alain R: Has made a mistake with N wrong hostnames.
               * Tony: This is part of what the 50 cert/day limit enforced - would spread requests out over multiple days. 
               * Decision: Carry the 50 cert/day limit forward.
         * Notes:
            * In-browser vs In-server key generation.
            * Jim: has had an extensive discussion with TAGPMA in CILogon, they were OK with it, so far users seem to like it. No bad experiences so far.
            * In-browser was number 1 complaint at March'12 AHM.
            * *Action Item*: Von to write up a page on this. Need to consider sustainability to make sure future maintenance doesn't break things.

      * Users must sign AUP in VOMRS every year, so pre-populating won't save users from visiting VOMRS; will save VOMS admin from approving new DN.
      * Anthony: pre-populating doesn't buy him anything.
      * Pre-population not a clear win over manual approval, especially given re-vetting is required.
      * Any VOs besides ATLAS and CMS we need to consider? GLOW has 12-20 users, would be more work, Engage has 70 users.
      * Housecleaning is benefit of manually.
      * Decision: We will do manual revetting at VOMS.
      * *Action Item*: Jim will write up pan for manual method (add DN to existing VOMS account).
      * Still see much value in GUMS supporting multiple users - expect both DNs to be in system for jobs in flight, and data access (CMS T1 do DN->userid mapping).
   * Report on OSG Certificate needs (Von)
      * Based on analysis of queries to http://pki1.doegrids.org/ca/srchCert.html

      * Soichi, Jeremy, Von
      * Users may legitimately have multiple certificates(?) - impacts duplicate detection.
        * Rob Q. confirms - users in multiple VOs.
      * Change: RA agents will not be able to approve Host/Svc certificates
         * Alex: Not going to be easy to have representatives from each domain, allow for delegation from authority.
      * Client-side authn for host scripts? No - Do we want CLI for anything besides host certificates - No.
         * Scripts currently ask for a personal certificate before generating CSR
         * cert-grid-admin - from OSG distribution, does authentication
         * then is another set of scripts that doesn't do authentication - cert-request.
         * Jeremy's script is called - will report.
         * Site admin may submit requests - and then Grid Admin must approve
         * Most of the time Site Admins are also Grid Admins, in that case an authenticated request from a Grid Admin does not need subsequent approval.
      * Matrix of supported features
         * This is in the system design doc: OIM Certificate Management System Design
      * Every request has to be approved by an RA Agent or Grid Admin
         * And not automated.
     * If we're going to have a CLI to generate a CSR, why not just have it do submission, why bring a web browser into it at all?
     * What are the packaging assumptions on what users have installed?
        * Table this for when Alain R.

AI: Jim and Von to talk to WLCG VOMS admins to determine policies on pre-loading.

AI: Von and Chander to group tasks to match project plan
   * Spend a few minutes on the technical plan - figure out what is high priority (needed by other parts)
   * Can we knock of the REST API design, as that seems simpler.

Agenda:
   * Contingency plans (Keith C.)
      * Latest draft on March 14th, Von comments on March 28th
   * DN change plans (Jim B.)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/DOEGrids2DigiCertDNTransition
      * Von asks: I suspect we'll be in a world with inconsistent GUMS deployment, can we handle that?
      * Alain: OSG 1.0 hasn't been supported in over a year and there are still a handful of sites running this.
      * It takes a long time to get everyone to upgrade.
      * Suspects a lot of sites will be willing to upgrade, still it will take months. LHC sites in production will be reluctant. Will need to think about how to make it as easy as possible.
      * Not sure there has been a non-security issue where software was pushed hard.
      * Believe we've done that with Gratia?
      * Will using the old GUMS with multiple DNs break things? We don't know. This will probably cause problems.
      * Can we have multiple VOMS accounts? One per DN
      * They are not equivalent.
      * Downside to "manual changeover" - GUMS queries VOMS 4x/day - so there is a lag
      * Tony: if you talk to CMS and ATLAS, they use VOMS in WLCG; not a big issue for CMS, they can update GUMS responsively.
      * Unit of transition is individual.
      * Having jobs in flight using proxies requires multiple DNs in VOMs.
      * Tony: suspect we need a 1-2 month window to get sites to upgrade. We think this is relatively easy for the 80% of LHC.
      * Option (A): everyone updates GUMS, add new DNs to existing VOMS accounts, nice and smooth
      * Option (B): add new VOMS accounts with new DNs in advance, existing account mappings could be broken - would need to explore specific account mappings
      * Option (C): once user gets their DigiCert certificate, they need to go to VOMS-Admin, VOMRS and register their new DN. May also require manual operation by VOMS administration, will require approval (Tony: yes, it will require approval).
      * Tony: Don't know we can get WLCG to pre-populate pre-existing DNs
      * Have VOs pick the option they desire? Can this be per-VOs choice?
      * Who is WLCG POC? Marty Pena (Tony will send me contact information) for CMS VOMS server.
      * Could put a temporary OSG VOMS server?
   * DigiCert contracts and agreements (Von)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/DigiCertAgreements
      * Von has reviewed, call with DigiCert postponed until tomorrow (Apr 4)
      * Question about Sponsor registration - required?
      * Can we make the RA agreements less legalese
      * Master Agreement looks OK
      * RPS needs some tweaks to remove old cyrptographic module language
      * Does it require collection of PII to add Agent? FNAL has a problem with that.

         * Would prefer signed email and shorter agreement.
      * DN change plans (Jim B.)
         * Take advantage of new feature in GUMS where we can associate multiple DNs with users
         * If we can predict DigiCert DNs, then we can load those into GUMS ahead of time
         * Puts a strong dependency for us on new GUMS work - John Hoover is spreadheading this.
         * AI: Jim to ping John (and Alain R.) let them know about our dependency, ask for updates, and ask for current timeline.
      * DigiCert contracts and agreements (Von)
         * New versions of all agreements received from DigiCert, haven't had a chance to review: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/DigiCertAgreements
         * Goal is to turn them around these around in the next week.
         * DigiCert Grid CA is now issuing 30-day CRLs
      * New JIRA Issue: We handle click-through or delegate to DigiCert? (Von)
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-5
         * In general seems like we should just undertake doing these things.
      * Design updates (Jeremy)
         * High-level design - initial version by 3/23, final version by 3/30: This is a short 2-3 document giving the high-level components of the front end, and also discussing any other components we will be producing (e.g., a new bulk host request script). The major thing this document will do is lay out the big decisions in terms of what software we'll leverage, e.g., OIM, or what is undecided, e.g. we'll need some library here to do REST calls. The initial version gets circulate for comment and then finalized by 3/30.
         * Components designs - initial versions by 4/17, finalized by 5/1. For each component, a ~4 page document describing what it will do, what it's requirements are, what it will interact with, and how we'll go about about developing it. Initial versions by 4/17 gives two weeks for comments and discussions and finalized by the 5/1 end of the planning phase. My expectation is we'd follow a MVC approach, so would have documents for the GUI, the database, and the controller logic (which would perhaps include interacting with DC or perhaps that would be another component), plus a document on the client script changes.
         * Almost got basic design document done, included Soichi work, plans to send to list tomorrow or Thursday. 40k ft view.
         * AI: Von and Soichi to review when it comes out.
      * Discussion of key generation options - user vs OSG (Soichi)
         * https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-3
         * DOE Grids site used browser generation of key pair, this create some support problems
         * Three ways to generate keys: (1) in browser (via Javascript or HTML5); (2) command line and paste CSR; (3) in the server
         * IE not going to support HTML5
         * Proposal is to support server-side generation.
         * Bulk-host certificate request: limits on request and per-day
         * Von's proposal is we support sever-side key generation for user certificates, with CSR-pasting as a secondary option.
         * Soichi says adding CSR-form isn't much work
         * Host certs are done primarily from the command-line today.
         * Do we need a web interface at all for host certificates? Sites with small number of hosts.
      * OSG RA/Grid Admin training plan (Mine/Von)
         * Mine not on call, Von to follow up off-list


---+ 19 March 2012

No call due to OSG AHM.

---+ 13 March 2012

Attending: Mine, Rob, Jeremey, Greg, Anthony, Chander, Alain, ...I'm sure I'm missing a few

Agenda:
   *  New email list, please subscribe if you want agendas for these calls and other announcements:
      * OSG-PKI-TRANSITION@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * To subscribe send email to listserv@fnal.gov with contents:
=SUBSCRIBE OSG-PKI-TRANSITION@opensciencegrid.org FIRSTNAME LASTNAME=
   * Von take aways with Mar 7 call with Area Coodinators:
      * Currently public cert requiest scripts are poorly maintained, it would be nice if maintenance could be addressed in our support plans
      * Brian B. would be a good source of friendly users
      * Brian B. will contact Von for a host certificate to play with
   * Short Updates:
      * Contingency plans (Keith C.)
      * DN change plans (Jim B.)
         * New version of GUMs that will suport multiple DNs per user that will help.
      * DigiCert contracts and agreements (Von)

      * OSG AHM presentation (Von)
         * Presentation next Monday at AHM
      * Design updates (Jeremy)
         * Make a version the CLI script that behaves exactly
         * We think main use is for bulk host generation
         * People write wrapper around VDT script - multi-cert-request script - this script is broken
         * CMS sites use certify - because they ran into issues with VDT software - https://www.racf.bnl.gov/experiments/usatlas/griddev/certify
         * Run interface by osg-sites
         * Can we just have a web-browser script that produces a tarball?
         * Philosophy is to replicate what DOE Grids PKI does by default unless we have good reason.
   * Discussion of key generation options - user vs OSG (Soichi)
      * Deferred, Soichi on PTO
   * No call on March 19th due to AHM

---+ 6 March 2012
