---++ Executive Summary

The CILogon project provides the open source, standards-based *CILogon Service* at [[https://cilogon.org/][https://cilogon.org/]], providing the NSF research community with credentials for secure access to cyberinfrastructure (CI). The service bridges the identity credentials generated by the nation’s universities, through the [[http://www.incommonfederation.org/][InCommon Federation]], to a certificate for authentication to NSF’s cyberinfrastructure projects.
---++ Owners

This SLA is owned by OSG and XSEDE and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the XSEDE team and the OSG Executive Team.

---++ Service Name and Description

---+++ !!Name

The CILogon Service

---+++ !!Description

The CILogon Service provides the certificate signing backend for [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/OSGCertificateService][CILogon OSG CA]]. OSG OIM interface was integrated with CILogon Hardware Security Module (CILogon HSM) resulting in the new CILogon OSG CA, which is operated by OSG in collaboration with XSEDE. Certificates from this CA are only issued issued if user/host/service certificate request has been approved by the Registration Authority Agent (RA) and/or Grid Admin (as the case may be).

CILogon also provides CILogon Basic CA. The CILogon Basic CA is a service that allows users at universities with existing single sign-on systems to use their campus credentials to get a certificate issued by the CILogon Basic CA instantly. This certificate is only issued if the campus single sign-on system verifies the user’s credentials. OSG is a relying party of CILogon Basic CA. Users from some research institutions and universities -which are members of OSG- get certificates from CILogon Basic CA using their institutions credentials.

---++ Security Considerations

Unavailability of the service does not constitute a security incident. Compromise of the service constitutes a declared security incident at OSG and XSEDE. Incident control in the case of compromise will fall to the XSEDE security officer or designee.

---++ Service Target Response Priorities and Response Times

This section deals with unplanned outages. Please see [[#Requests_for_Service_Enhancement][Requests for Service Enhancement]] for information on planned maintenance outages.

Any ongoing "High" or "Elevated" level issues will be discussed at the weekly [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes][Operations]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings][Production]] meetings.

---++ Service Availability and Outages

The parties will strive for 95% service availability. If service availability falls below 95% monthly as monitored by OSG Operations on two consecutive months a root cause analysis and service plan will be submitted to the OSG stakeholders for plans to restore an acceptable level of service availability.

---++ Service Support Hours
The service is supported 24x7 by XSEDE. All issues reported to XSEDE will be investigated by the next business day.

---++ Service Off-Hours Support Procedures
The primary method for off-hour support is creation of a XSEDE trouble ticket [[https://portal.xsede.org/help-desk][here]]. Additionally,
issues can be reported through a GOC ticket at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/submit][trouble ticket]].

---++ Requests for Service Enhancements

This section deals with planned maintenance outages. XSEDE does scheduled maintenance for the CILogon service. The maintenance is announced 1 week before through email and posted at [[http://www.cilogon.org/news][http://www.cilogon.org/news]]

---++ Customer Problem Reporting

CILogon service problems should be reported immediately by one of the following mechanisms. 

   * Creating a problem ticket [[https://portal.xsede.org/help-desk][here]] (*preferred*)
   * Creating a problem ticket [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/submit][here]] (for next business day response)
   * Emailing a description to goc@opensciencegrid.org (for next business day response)
