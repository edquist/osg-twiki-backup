   * Internal LDAP server became unstable early AM Wed. 20/Jul, root cause too many open file descriptors caused by a large (x12) increase in processes on osg-xsede.grid.iu.edu.

Some rsynch and backup delays were encountered, staff access was intermittent during the problem. Resolved ~10 AM 20/Jul.
