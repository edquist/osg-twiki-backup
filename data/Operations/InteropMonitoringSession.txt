---++ Accomplished

Test OSG Messaging Broker Installed and running. This will allow bi-directional flow of messages from the messaging system. First usage to be in checking error and duplicate records reported to WLCG.

---++ Action Item List

*ACTION:* Have SAM/Gridview look at myOSG as possible frontend for nagios.

*ACTION:* Gridview calculation algorithm…  need to pass to Gridview the concerns of Soichi.

*ACTION:* Connection of OSG and gridmsg002 for testing purposes.

*ACTION:* Should put a consumer in place at OSG side to check rejections.

*ACTION:* Watch for BDII Upgrades from Laurence.

---++ Notes 

MyOSG
Nice UI on top of RSV/OIM.  Creates widgets.
URL for  myOSG.  http://rsv.grid.iu.edu or http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/.

WLCG Messaging Broker
Messaging & probe specification changes
We commit to running a 0.91 WLCG probe consume2oracle instance for WLCG as long as needed.

BDII
Laurence + Arvind had discussion on BDII usage in OSG, and upcoming changes and how they would affect OSG.

If it can put in place and see transparent behaviour and performance increases then it'll be deployed - march is possible.
	
Install of messaging broker
- RHEL 5 
	&#9675; BUG -  adduser doesn't  work

- Add MSG_SERVER_CLUSTER
	&#9675; BUG- This isn't working in info-provider correctly

- Remove VOs down to just 'ops'

- Logtail doesn't work - is it in the rpm ?


Bi-drectional message flow
First usage will be to get RSV results and for arvind to receive consumer errors.

Nagios
Interested in Nagios executor for OSG site monitoring + monitoring from the GOC.  This would imply them  using NCG.  Perhaps Emir should schedule visit to US to work on this.
