---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Operations Last Week
   *  More network maintenance completed, Wednesday, July 8th with short outages -- continued preparation for machine room move scheduled for Sep 19 2009
      * is1.grid.iu.edu (BDII, traffic will be directed to second instance is2 during maintenance.) and MyOSG 
      * With this change, all GOC services have been moved to the new VLAN. This will allow us to follow a simpler process of migrating the machines physically in September.

---++ Operations This Week
   * *Request to site-administrators*: [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/07/mportant-please-restart-tomcat-on-your.html][Please restart tomcat on your CEs]] - we are still seeing several CEs not reporting to is1.grid.iu.edu - note that removal of temporary rsync from is2 could potentially remove your CE from the BDII!
   * Carry-forward from last week: Yum repository network reconfiguration - very ephemeral outage expected (mid week)
