---+++ From Retreat "Who is Using !ReSS?"
   1. Fermigrid has a deployment of !ReSS services internally for the !FermiGrid clusters and is quite dependent on !ReSS.
   2. !DZero uses the information from !Ress directly.
   3. glideinWMS uses this information in somewhat static way. There are plans to investigate and consume this information more actively if possible.
   4. OSG Match Maker uses !ReSS
