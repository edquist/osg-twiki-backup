---++++ Grid Operations Center
   *  ITB release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2016/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-march-8-2016.html][Release note]], to production this week.

   * A disk usage spike on =backup.grid.iu.edu= was caused on Saturday by a problem with OSG Software's backup script:
      * A deduplication script runs as part of the process, linking files from one week's backup to the previous week's backup.
        Due to failures at UW, the previous week's backup did not run, and the script did not find the files to link to.
      * Main.MatyasSelmeci resolved the issue manually, and will update the script to avoid this behavior next time.
        See [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2235][SOFTWARE-2235]].
