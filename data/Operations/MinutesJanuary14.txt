---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesDecember17][previous meeting]]

1. DOSAR VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS update (_Horst_)
   * Horst did followup on the ticket but we're still experiencing problems, but Steve Timm is now able to contact their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS as of meeting time, but earlier this morning there were failures.

2. GIP data filter on BDII ITB Interoperability. Fermilab has been testing with FERMIGRID_ITB. The filter has taken out unwanted Glue attributes as expected.
   * This is working, but we still would like to have more testers. Additionally we need to verify that this will not affect interoperability. Anand & Tim will followup with Burt and Tony.

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. The GOC encourages all 0.8.0 sites to configure RSV

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Included_topic_Install_And_Confi

2. DOEGrids Old CA Expiration -- GOC VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS outage Thursday, January 10th

The old VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS version at the GOC did not pull the new certificate, so that lead to a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server failure.

3. New VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS template released last week includes updates to fmri, iVDGL, !GridEx, OSGEDU and MIS VOs.

All VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's should pull this package to grab these latest updates. We're anticipating removing the old VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS in a couple of months.

---++ OSG RA Items

A reminder that the DOEGrids CA certificate expired last week, January 10. 

---++ Pending Registrations

None.
