---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * We observed five crashes of the production Gratia collector gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org between March 1 and March 3.  Monitoring detected it automatically and it was quickly restarted each time.  Still investigating the cause with the developers.  No obvious loads out of the ordinary.
   * Discussions still under way between us, Soichi, and probe developers (UNL) on maintenance of various database tables needed to send the output of the gratia-bdii probe to production Gratia.
