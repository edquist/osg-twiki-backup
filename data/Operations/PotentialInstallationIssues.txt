---++ Potential Installation Issues

Going through the installation procedure for [[Documentation.OsgCEInstallGuide][OSG 0.2.1]]
and noting things that may raise questions of may need correction.  Not an exhaustive list, just from my experience.

---+++ !OsgMailingLists

At end of Pre-installation checklist in the subsection "Assistance during the installation"
there is a link to !OsgMailingLists that references !http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/OsgMailingLists
in the Trash/Integration TWiki.  This should probably refer to a more permanent location.

---+++ Mail list page on production Grid Support

Related to the above item.  Should this page
[[http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=60][http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=60]]
and this page
[[Trash/Integration.OsgMailingLists][http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/OsgMailingLists]]
be reconciled.

---+++  Request and Install Host Certificate

Change the instructions for getting certificates to use the cert-scripts package.


---+++ !GridThreeSchema

Under "Configuration and Setup of OSG CE Services" subsection 
"Configuring the Grid3 Information Provider" the second paragraph has a reference
to [[Trash/Integration.GridThreeSchema][GridThreeSchema]] which is on the Trash/Integration TWiki.
This should be moved from Trash/Integration to a permanent location.

---+++ configure-osg.sh

When running the configure-osg.sh script, it asks for a Policy URL but does not
list it in the summary under "Please review the information:".  It should also list the POLICY_URL.<br/>
Also, for my installation, the hostname information in the generated grid3-info.conf
file was not the <FQDN> but just the local host name without the lbl.gov. If it gets this from executing the hostname command, perhaps it should use "hostname -f".  This is for the variables GRID3_JOB_CONTACT, GRID3_UTIL_CONTACT, and hostname.

---+++Authorizing users

Should move the instructions [[Trash/Integration.OsgCEAuthorization][OsgCEAuthorization]]
off of Trash/Integration and on to Documentation.
And then the links underneath, such as to !GumsAdmins, should also point to a production page
and not an Trash/Integration page.

---+++ configure-misci.sh

Instructions say to use the --choose-user switch to specify the local account for running the MIS-CI cron jobs. Is this the same account as for the mis VO?<br/>
Answer is that it can be the same account as for the mis VO. See [[http://www.ppdg.net/cgi-bin/roundup.cgi/osg-csc/issue9][CSC issue9]].

I ran <br/><tt>configure-misci.sh --choose-user someacct</tt> <br/>and there were no complaints until
is said <br/><tt>ivdgl does not exist<br/>
Please create the user ivdgl and ...<br/>
Or use the option --choose_user ...</tt><br/>
It would be nice if the script complains about invalid options, like using '-' rather than '_'.

The VOs put into $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/misci/mis-ci-site-info.cfg is not the same as listed on the main instructions page [[Documentation.OsgCEInstallGuide][OSG 0.2.1]].  I guess they should be the same for the default installation.

After running the <tt>run-mis-ci.sh</tt> I do the <br/>
<tt>globus-job-run <hostname>/jobmanager-mis /bin/sh "siteinfo" </tt><br/>
and the output seems to look good, except the line<br/>
<tt>hostname                 localhost</tt><br/>
Should it really say localhost?

---+++ Mysql

Somewhere in the installation instructions there should be a reminder to set a good password on the administrative account for mysql.

---+++ GUMS

I copied the STAR group mappings prescription from
[[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Provisioning/GumsTemplate][http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Provisioning/GumsTemplate]]
including the 
<verbatim>
<!--- 9 STAR ---!>
</verbatim>
and got an error when doing the "Update Members" from the GUMS web interface 
<verbatim> (!https://somehost:8443/gums) </verbatim>.  The error in the admin log file 
($VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v5/logs/gums-service-admin.log)
said<br/>
<tt>
01 Jul 2005 15:05:25,668 [FATAL]: The configuration wasn't read properly. GUMS is not 
operational: The string "--" is not permitted within comments.
</tt><br/>

I needed to change the !sslCertfile and !sslKey values from<br/>
<tt>/etc/grid-security/host{cert|key}.pem</tt> to <tt>/etc/grid-security/http/http{cert|key}.pem</tt>

---+++ Stopped at

GUMS running and working with STAR VO.
