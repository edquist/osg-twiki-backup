---++ Potential Installation Issues

Going through the installation procedure for [[Documentation.OsgCEInstallGuide][OSG 0.2.1]]
and noting things that may raise questions of may need correction.  Not an exhaustive list, just from my experience.

---+++ !OsgMailingLists

At end of Pre-installation checklist in the subsection "Assistance during the installation"
there is a link to !OsgMailingLists that references !http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OsgMailingLists
in the Integration TWiki.  This should probably refer to a more permanent location.

---+++ Mail list page on production Grid Support

Related to the above item.  Should this page
[[http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=60][http://osg.grid.iu.edu/OSG/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=40&Itemid=60]]
and this page
[[Integration.OsgMailingLists][http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OsgMailingLists]]
be reconciled.

---+++  Request and Install Host Certificate

Change the instructions for getting certificates to use the cert-scripts package.


---+++ !GridThreeSchema

Under "Configuration and Setup of OSG CE Services" subsection 
"Configuring the Grid3 Information Provider" the second paragraph has a reference
to [[Integration.GridThreeSchema][GridThreeSchema]] which is on the Integration TWiki.
This should be moved from Integration to a permanent location.

---+++ configure-osg.sh

When running the configure-osg.sh script, it asks for a Policy URL but does not
list it in the summary under "Please review the information:".  It should also list the POLICY_URL.<br/>
Also, for my installation, the hostname information in the generated grid3-info.conf
file was not the <FQDN> but just the local host name without the lbl.gov. If it gets this from executing the hostname command, perhaps it should use "hostname -f".  This is for the variables GRID3_JOB_CONTACT, GRID3_UTIL_CONTACT, and hostname.
