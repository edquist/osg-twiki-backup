---+ vomses file with new OSG PKI 

---++ Explanation

The current VO Package contains a file named =vomses= this file is called when a user initiates creation of a voms proxy by using =voms-proxy-init=. A copy of the production version of this file can be found at this [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-package/vomses][link]]. This file contains the host or http cert DN used on each VOMS instance in OSG. When new OSG PKI certs are put onto the VOMS machines (most likely when the current certs expire), this will need to be distributed to the users that are dependent on =voms-proxy-init= or their attempt to get a proxy will fail. 

---++ Impact to OSG Community

Users reliant on =voms-proxy-init= will not be able to create proxies until the =vomses= file is updated on their submission node when their VO changes certificates on the VOMS for that VO.

---++ Plan to Inform and Help Users

   1 Notify during the PKI switchover that this will be announced as a known issue with a well documented and quick solution.
   2 Thorough documentation will be prepared on a TWiki page explaining the steps needed to fix the issue. 
   3 OSG Operations Support will be fully brief on how to address this issue with users that open tickets on this issue.
   4 OSG Software and Operations will make sure search engines are processing likely error messages to find the right documentation.
