---+ Post Upgrade Functionality Checks

This document is to provide a list of checks that will test the functionality of the !MyOSG service after an upgrade has been done. It is assumed the DNS round robin (RR) mechanism was used during the maintenance period and these checks should be performed before an instance is returned to round robin.

   * Verify which instance has been removed from RR with dig. 
      * myosg1.grid.iu.edu is 129.79.14.169
      * myosg2.grid.iu.edu is 134.68.22.137
      * dig, for example, returns this:

   * Note that 134.68.22.137 is not in the "ANSWER SECTION" returned from dig. This means myosg2.grid.iu.edu is the instance removed for maintenance and is the instance to be checked.

---+++ Functionality
   * Execute on the correct instance. /opt/service-monitor/myosg/test.sh If problems are found e-mail will be sent.
   * go to the correct instance: [[http://myosg1.grid.iu.edu/][MyOSG1]] or [[http://myosg2.grid.iu.edu/][MyOSG2]]
      * page should load in a resonable time, without error and with the expected content.
   * click on the "Sample Pages"
      * page should load in a resonable time, without error and with the expected content. The "Status Map" page is an exception, it will only load correctly from [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/][MyOSG]] (without the 1 or 2)
      * "Current RSV Status" page should contain recent data
   * do an OIM search. Enter text (csiu, for example)
      * search results should appear below the search box
   * Make sure there are no service monitor alerts posted for goc-alert for at least 30 minutes after the maintenance completion.
