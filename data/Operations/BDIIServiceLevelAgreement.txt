This SLA is an agreement between OSG Operations and the OSG Stakeholders describing details of the OSG BDII Information Service. The BDII service runs on hardware at Indiana University and Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis and consists of the CEMon Server data collection software, the Berkeley Database Information Index (BDII), and GOC provided software which serves as the bridge between CEMon and BDII.

---++ Owners
The BDII SLA is owned by OSG Operations and will be reviewed and agreed upon by the OSG Facility.

Access to any of the hardware or software will be restricted to OSG Operations staff. Other OSG staff may upon request be giving access to a development version of the BDII for experimenting with new software updates, changes in database/GLUE schema, or testing for stress testing.
