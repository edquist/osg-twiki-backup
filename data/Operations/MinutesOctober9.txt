---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesOctober2][previous meeting]]

1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:
      * Still having trouble with Vanderbilt. Can't get jobs into the queue. Rob created some tickets on the issue, but there have been no replies. LIGO is seeing the problem as well with several users, so he suspects it may be a problem with the overall software stack. 
      * The South American site (UERJ) was suggested as a place to run jobs, but at the meeting it was suggested by Brian at Nebraska that nanoHUB should use SPRACE also.
   * This week:

2) New VO package was released last Wed.
   * Package includes addition of the !CompBioGrid VO and changes to STAR and ATLAS VOMS URL

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) OSG usage spotlight on SDSS (_GADU will attend next week_)

2) GROW VO support

3) OSG scheduled maintenance tool

---++ OSG RA Items

A new version of the cert-scripts package, http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Security/CertScriptsPackage is available.
   * This is a major update in that the scripts now pull valid RA and VO information from remote locations so it can be updated independent of the code version of the scripts.

---++ Pending Registrations

Resource: LTU_OSG
   * Production CE
   * Supported by DOSAR
