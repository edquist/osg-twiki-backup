---++ Hot Topics for the week

1. CEMon/BDII Aggregator Problems <br>
Started sometime over the weekend, most of the data we have are about 66 hours old.
GOC is actively working on it.  Services were restarted in the AM, but still experiencing issues.
Burt reports CMS has been unable to push data since friday around 5pm CST, problems with transfers, etc.
isgrid on port 14001 is refusing connections, and there is stale data for a handful of resources.
GOC is currently investigating and will send notifications

2. RSV collector crash Thursday, Feb. 7. Update<br>
Brief outage to the RSV collector.  The collector died due to a possible change at the SAM side. 
SAM folks confirm this and jobs backed up on the collector until things crashed.  It is now back up and fixed, records are flowing.
No data was actually lost, just delayed and queued locally.  Email was sent to resources that were affected.
Once the server came back up, we were not receiving data as the automatic restoration of record sending did not happen on certain resources.
This is normally not the case as in the past the collector was brought down and things started again just fine..
Email was sent to admins requesting them to restart rsv

---++ OSG RA Items

no new items<Br>
item from last week - re: cern CRL<br>
Ian at the EU grid meeting about a month ago<br>
He ran the old cern ca that was retired last nov<br>
early jan, a couple thousand hosts still trying to download crls from there<br>
they had not updated their ca info in the past couple of months<br>
Doug has this info and will forward the set of hosts to the GOC so something can go out to site admins/support center to update
<br>
0.8.0 resources have an automated mechanism<br>
0.6.0 is still a manual process
<br>
side note: new package relased by vdt on tuesday feb 5th<br>
ca cert package updated to 1.19<br>
GOC sent notif based after being informed by the VDT<br>

grid school certs<br>
several cert requets came in with sponsor alina and those have been approved with no issues<br>
Alina is looking to become a RA agent and an OSGEDU voms admin<br>
less admin overhead and faster for the gridschool<br>
