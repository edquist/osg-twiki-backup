---++ RSV

   * Brian produces a daily email report for Availability which is sent to osg-accounting-info@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG 
   * A web presentation is still under development at the GOC. 

---++ RSV to SAM/GridView Transport
<p> RSV results, received by the central collector at the GOC, are uploaded to the WLCG SAM if a resource-service mapping is listed on the [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/publisher/get_osg_interop_monitoring_list.php][Interop monitoring list]]. The format of the above listing is as follows: 
<pre>Resource_group_name, Resource_FQDN, Grid_type-Service</pre> 

<p> Grid_type can be =OSG= or =OSG-ITB=, and service can be =CE=, =GridFtp=, =SRMv1=, =SRMv2=, =BestmanXrootd=. For example: 

<pre>AGLT2, gate01.aglt2.org, OSG-CE</pre>

      * Note that the above list is dynamically generated using Interop Monitoring flag setting for each resource in OIM. 
      * In OIM, anyone who is listed as an admin or security or misc contact for a resource can edit that resource to check/uncheck the flag 
      * If you think you should be able to modify a resource but do not have access, contact the GOC.
