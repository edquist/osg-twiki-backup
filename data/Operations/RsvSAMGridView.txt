---++ RSV

   * Brian produces a daily email report for Availability which is sent to osg-accounting-info@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG 
   * A web presentation is still under development at the GOC. 

---++ RSV to SAM/GridView Transport
   * RSV results are uploaded by the GOC to SAM if a resource-service mapping is listed on the [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/publisher/get_osg_interop_monitoring_list.php][Interop monitoring list]]
      * Note that the above list is dynamically generated using Interop Monitoring flag setting for each resource in OIM. 
      * In OIM, anyone who is listed as an admin or a security contact for a resource can edit that resource. 
      * If you think you should be able to modify a resource but do not have access, contact the GOC.

---++ SAM
