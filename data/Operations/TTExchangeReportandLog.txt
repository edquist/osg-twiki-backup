---+ Purpose

With the upcoming LHC turn on and the increased load expected by CMS and ATLAS the GOC is reviewing our trouble ticket exchange mechanisms. This document is intended to describe the exchange processes with each of the important LHC stakeholders and log any problems. The final deliverable will be recomendations to update and improve the exchanges under the following timeline.

| Date | Deliverable |
| Sept 1 | Report and Conclusions available for stakeholder input. |
| Sept 8 | Sign off by stakeholders and OSG Facility to proceed. |
| Sept 29 | Updates to exchange mechanism ready for testing. |
| Oct 6 | All Updates in place for LHC turn up. |

---+ Report of Current Trouble Ticket Exchange

---++ GOC/GGUS Ticket Exchange

Each campus maintains their own scripts for parsing incoming emails. GGUS emails are sent in XML format and the GOC's parser strips those details from the email. Tickets from GGUS to the GOC are opened without human intervention. However, to open a iticket with the GGUS system the GOC must create the ticket then login to the ticketing system's database server to run a perl script which will pull the data from the database and format it into an email to be addressed to GGUS. This must be done in order to open a new ticket with GGUS or to open a new one with them. This process has potential faults since it does require the GOC to take manual steps in order to send every update to GGUS. With other ticket exchanges this process requires no special action.
---++ GOC/ATLAS Ticket Exchange

ATLAS uses the RT ticketing system. They utilize a perl script that prevents ticket looping since each system automatically sends acknowledgments to all incoming email. The GOC is not required to deviate from normal ticket processing procedures.
---++ GOC/CMS Ticket Exchange

CMS is hosted at Fermilab and they use Remedy as their ticketing system. They have developed a script to parse incoming emails from the GOC. The script also prevents mail loops. The GOC has made modifications to the outgoing emails in order to help CMS parsing, providing them with ticket numbers (ours and theirs) in the email.
