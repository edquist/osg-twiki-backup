---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) GADU's large job run
   * "There are three tools to be run, each tool is divided into approximately 40K jobs each running for about ~ 2 1/2 hours. I am expecting this run to take atleast a month, if not more. My target is to maintain more than 1000 running jobs as consistently as possible. Along with OSG, I will also be using Teragrid sites in this run." -Dinanath
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/gaduvo/gadu_jobs.cgi -- number of jobs running or jobs in queue at each site used
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/sulakhe/cgi-bin/site_selection_new.pl -- total number of sites from OSG and Teragrid that GADU has access to and their status for tests
