1) Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
   * Last update:  Vanderbilt run completed. Last few days it ran it was very steady. So he sent another batch there and another batch at PSU. Still having problems at Buffalo, but that is still under investigation. Rob will ask Steve Gallo about the situation at Buffalo if he sees him at SC06. Condor compiled error. Standard universe jobs. Alain Roy said that sometimes the new version comes out and you have to recompile your software. Alain agreed to check the version to see if it is compatible or not.

   * Problems found with Condor Standard universe jobs and version incombatiblity (Ticket 2636)
      Alain Roy will work with Steve Clark to create a matrix of condor versions which 
      will work.

   * *This week*: 


---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) GADU's large job run  _Dina_
   * "There are three tools to be run, each tool is divided into approximately 40K jobs each running for about ~ 2 1/2 hours. I am expecting this run to take atleast a month, if not more. My target is to maintain more than 1000 running jobs as consistently as possible. Along with OSG, I will also be using Teragrid sites in this run." -Dinanath
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/gaduvo/gadu_jobs.cgi -- number of jobs running or jobs in queue at each site used
   * http://compbio.mcs.anl.gov/sulakhe/cgi-bin/site_selection_new.pl -- total number of sites from OSG and Teragrid that GADU has access to and their status for tests

2) Clemson joining OSG _Rob_

3) Deprecating the use of vanilla grid-proxy certificates and only use voms-proxy certs in OSG. The Europeans already only use voms-proxies.  Is there a very strong reason for us not to follow suit? _Dan Yocum_
