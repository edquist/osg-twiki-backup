---++ Announcements
   * A water leak in the IUPUI machine room required one instance of BDII to be shut down. It was removed from DNS RR at 17:00 (eastern) Friday, 2/Dec. Service continued through the weekend with a single instance hosted at IUB. The IUPUI instance was restored to service in the morning of Monday 5/Dec. All power sockets that were submerged will be replaced at a time yet to be announced. We have been assured we will be notified prior to this replacement.
   * The IU mandated privacy policy will go into effect 13/Dec. Read it [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/IUPrivacyPolicy][here]]
   * Two additional instances of BDII will be added to DNS round robin on 13/Dec. These will be running BDII v5.
