---++ August 7
1. Reminder: Gridscan's (VORS) new DN is /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Leigh Grundhoefer (GridScan) 274052 The VO membership is MIS. Previous announcements have been made and the GOC will begin creating tickets for failing sites.

2. 2269 Fermi/Remedy - 82585 - goc@opensciencegrid.org forwarding
The GOC is moving to a new mail server. We are waiting for Fermilab to identify all addresses in the opensciencegrid.org domain that will need to be forwarded to the new server.

3. 2305 NWICG-NotreDame Resource/Service Registration was reviewed and approved.

4. GridCat - sites are on it that should be removed. If groups send email to the GOC we will open a ticket(s) to have them removed.

---++ August 14
1. Large resource request for nanoHUB update (ongoing) - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/NANOHUB_UtilStatus
Error 123 could not write job state file is the Condor_G error. Doug has been working with Jaime Frey with the Condor Team to resolve the problem. Alain Roy will followup w/Jaime.

2. Ticket loops between VDT & GOC resolved. Alain Roy has created a script for use with their ticketing system, RT, to prevent ticket looping. This may be helpful to other SC's using RT (GRASE & PROD_SLAC). Alain asks that any groups using RT may contact him to obtain the script.

3. Usage of OSG resources report. This week: the STAR VO.
They are using only their resources, not other Resources on the grid. There are five STAR sites. They have a lot of problems with SGE and they're trying to get support on those issues. Refer to http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/STAR_UtilStatus

4. 2269 Fermi/Remedy - 82585 - goc@opensciencegrid.org forwarding. All aliases have been identified. We're working on stabilizing the system monitoring.

5. 2356 Remove the NO VO accounting from the ML plots. There were no objections to this change. Change completed.
