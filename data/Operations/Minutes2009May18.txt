      1) Resource summary pages now provides
       a. Environment Parameters
       b. WLCG Information
       c. Contact Information (such as report contact, admin contact, etc)
       d. BDII LDAP List
       e. Service URI
      2) Allows displaying of removed resources (for people doing some report against old set of resources)
      3) New filters for resource pages (Active Status, WLCG)
      4) Support center summary page
      5) Virtual organization summary page
          a. Shows member resource
          b. Shows field of science
          c. Shows reporting group information (OIM2 FQAN and Contacts)
      6) Added explanation at the top of each XML and added URL back to original MyOSG page at the bottom of each XML
      7) Now uses OIM2 DB (data is synced from OIM1 to OIM2 daily until OIM2 production release)

      * *Sample Pages*
         *    For ATLAS users who are interested in using CEs and SRMs(v2), they can go to following link > http://tinyurl.com/cg7t6p  This page shows ATLAS resources with service URIs and the environment parameters gathered by central RSV probes.
         *  For Fermilab users who are interested in VO Reporting Groups information, they can go here> http://tinyurl.com/cuepwe This page shows information about their reporting groups that are stored in OIM2
         * As usual, any pages you see on MyOSG can be exported to XML by clicking "XML" link under Subscription section. On the other hand, if you already have XML, the button of each XML contains link back to MyOSG with exact query settings that you used to generate the XML so that you can modify / update the query again. (We need to make this link more obvious and easier  for users to find..)

   * OIM V2 Beta testing almost complete. Will release shortly
