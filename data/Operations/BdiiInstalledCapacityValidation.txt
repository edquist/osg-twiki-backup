---+++ BDII adjustment script

---++++ What does it do?
The script provides the logic for:
   * Using the BDII data to calculate the Installed capacity (based on the guidelines laidout in the installed capacity document) at a site.
   * Comparing the calculated installed capacity to the pre-determined (upper and lower) limits
   * If the calculated installed capacity falls outside the limits then:
      * Adjusting the BDII data so that the calculated installed capacity falls within the limits

---++++ Can you provide an example?
Yes, here is an example scenario for AGLT2:

upper bound: 4000 (Fake value, for testing purposes only)<br>
lower bound: 3000 (Fake value, for testing purposes only)<br>

[ Question: Who will provide the upper/lower bounds for each site? ]

Calculated installed capacity: 4136<br>
Adjusted installed capacity: 4000 (limited to upper bound)<br>
Installed capacity adjustment:  -3%<br>

Corresponding adjustments made in the physical/logical CPUs (-3% applied across all sub-clusters):<br>
GlueSubClusterPhysicalCPUs: 19<br>
GlueSubClusterLogicalCPUs: 19<br>
GlueSubClusterPhysicalCPUs: 876<br>
GlueSubClusterLogicalCPUs: 876<br>
GlueSubClusterPhysicalCPUs: 706<br>
