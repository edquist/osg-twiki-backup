---+ Operations Agenda

---++ Followup items from the [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Operations/MinutesJuly9][previous meeting]]

Reminder to register for the upcoming OSG Site Administrators Technical Meeting at Fermilab (July 30, 31). The hope is to have at least one admin from each site. Information and registration is available at https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=866

---++ Hot Topics for the week

1) Retirement of the OSG VOMS at IU

2) VO spotlight on DZero

One of the most important requests that DZero can make is having the renewed support of the troubleshooting team for our future activities on the OSG. We plan to include more and more applications to run on the OSG. The troubleshooting team was instrumental to making the operational load for the data reprocessing manageable.
