-- Main.ScottTeige - 18 Jul 2011

---+++ Announcements
   * Power maintenance by IU engineers in Indianapolis machine room completed without incident Jul 14-15
   * IU network engineers plan another outage Sunday Jul 24, 6:00-8:00 AM EDT 
      * Anticipated to be very short, 10-15 minutes.
      * Plan for this time same as for last time.

---+++ Glide-in SLA
   * Should be "High Priority" service
   * 99% Availability
   * Plan to announce availability Aug 8th.
   * Currently working on monitoring of service.
   * Moving forward: (Igor Sfiligoi)
      * We plan to initially support only "vanilla OSG" entry points.
        This means not HTPC or weird RSL parameters.
      * We have to decide what glideinWMS version to use.
        We currently have the UCSD branch installed. Version 2.5.1 is not really usable, and 2.5.2 is not yet out.
        We will re-evaluate once 2.5.2 is out.
      * We need clarification on how we decide which VOs/frontends to support.
        Do we still have full autonomy, or do we need to co-ordinate with GOC on this?
      * We need to formalize the change management plan. Until now it was a very abstract concept in our discussions.
         * BTW: We are supposed to get a "test gfactory" node. What are the plans at GOC for this?
      * We need to agree with GOC what areas need backing up, monitoring, etc.


---+++ ITB release tomorrow
   * OS updates, will require reboot.
   * Installed capacity report to be installed on OIM-ITB

---+++ JIRA
