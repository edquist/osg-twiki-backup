---+ CVMFS Requirements Discusssion

April 25th, 2012 2PM EDT <br>
Phone: +1-866-740-1260, code 8266135

---++ Call Notes

Attendees: Scott T, Rob, Alain R, Dave, Dan B. 

Document from OSG Blueprint Meeting is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Blueprint/BlueprintFNALApril2012/OASIS_requirements.docx.

Existing repo at U Wisconsin supported by Dan Bradley. Users write with a globus job to an App directory which is rsynced and mounted with a FUSE mount. Any CVMFS client can read from this FUSE mount. The central service could be a CE and CVMFS Server. Filename and URL based on the secure checksum of the contents.

A few instances of the repository have becoming corrupted. Some amount of effort was used to troubleshoot and restore this. 

And would be a critical level service if it is relied on to distributed application software. 

One proposed setup is GOC hosting a stratum 0 and 1 and other friendly sites providing stratum 1 resources. 

Would need both ITB and Production level services. 

U Wisc implementation notes can be found at http://www.hep.wisc.edu/cms/comp/ops/cvmfs.html

Rob and Brian will discuss the Blueprint OASIS document tomorrow at 11EDT.
