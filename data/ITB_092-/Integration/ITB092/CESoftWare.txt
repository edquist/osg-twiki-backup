---+++ Discovering which version of the OSG Software Stack you've installed.

&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt; ./osg-version
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>

---+++ Finding all services that are part of your install

You can use the vdt-control command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:

You can use the =vdt-control= command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:
> vdt-control --list
<pre class="programlisting">
> <b>vdt-control --list </b>
Service            | Type   | Desired State
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | do not enable
gris               | init   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
gris               | init   | do not enable
globus-gatekeeper  | inetd  | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
globus-ws          | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
condor             | init   | enable
gratia-condor      | cron   | enable
</pre>

Below we break down the services that you can expect to be on your system. All of these are listed by vdt-control: they are broken down here in order to give you more information.

---+++ The xinetd services that are included

---++ The xinetd services that are included
Two services are run via xinetd:
| *Service* | *Description* |
| gsiftp | !GridFTP |
---+++ /etc/services

---++ /etc/services
| gsiftp | 2881/tcp | 
| *Service* | *Port* |
| gsiftp | 2811/tcp | 
---+++ The init.d services that are included

---++ The init.d services that are included
| mysql       | used by globus-ws |
| condor     | setup optionally by ManagedFork |
| MLD         | MonALISA - setup optionally by configure-osg.sh |
| condor    | setup optionally by ManagedFork |
| apache     | In front of Tomcat |
</pre>
| tomcat-5  |  used by CEMon and BDII and optionally globus-ws |
---+++ Cron jobs

---++ Cron jobs
Some cron jobs are installed with random times. Look at =crontab -l= to see which ones you have. Likely candidates are:

| *Cron Job* | *Description* |
| fetch-crl | Update the certificate authority revocation lists. Verify importation for security purposes |
| vdt-rotate-logs | Rotate log files periodically, to keep them from growing too large |
| gums-host-cron | If you use GUMS, generate the osg-user-vo-map.txt file | 
| gratia-condor | Report accounting data from Condor | 
| gratia-pbs-lsf | Report accounting data from PBS or LSF |

An example crontab file:
<i>root</i> cron
<pre class="programlisting">
36 4 * * * /storage/local/data1/osg-ce/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.2/fetch-crl.cron
0 0 * * * /storage/local/data1/osg-ce/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
27 4,10,16,22 * * * /storage/local/data1/osg-ce/gums/bin/gums-host-cron
6,16,26,36,46,56 * * * * /storage/local/data1/osg-ce/gratia/probe/condor/condor_meter.cron.sh &gt; /storage/local/data1/osg-ce/gratia/var/logs/gratia-probe-condor.log 2&gt;&1
---+++ Log file rotation

---++ Log file rotation
The following are the log files that are configured for rotation with the installation in 
=$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt.logrotate=:

<pre class="programlisting">
# Rotate daily
daily
# Keep a week's worth
rotate 7
# Compress old files

compressoptions -9f
# Truncate, instead of moving, files to avoid problems with apps
copytruncate
# Just ignore it if they're not there
missingok
# Rotate these files
