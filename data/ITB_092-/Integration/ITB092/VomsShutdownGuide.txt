---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS shutdown and vdt-control

Since VDT 1.6.1 and later, all services (=/etc/init.d=, =/etc/xinetd.d=, =cron=) should be turned on/off using the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control= script.  This includes VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS services.  Note for vdt-control there is a <i>man</i> page available for the script, just type =man vdt-control=. You can also find the man page here:  %VDT_DOCS_URL%/man/vdt-control.html.

---++ Services controlled by <i>vdt-control</i>
To view all services controlled by <i>vdt-control</i>:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
&gt; <b>vdt-control --list </b>
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs   | cron   | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-55          | init   | enable
voms               | init   | enable
</pre>

To shutdown <em>all</em> services:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
&gt; <b>vdt-control --off </b>
</pre>

To shutdown <b>individual</b> services:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
&gt; <b>vdt-control --off  Service </b>
</pre>

To shutdown the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server for an individual VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and leave others up, you will need to use the =/etc/init.d= service directly.  The =vdt-control= script starts/stops =ALL= VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo servers.
<pre class="screen">
> <b>service voms stop VO_NAME</b>
</pre>


---++ /etc/init.d services
For =/etc/init.d= services, the script will be removed from the directory and the service will be stopped.

---++ crontabs
For =root= cron entries, the entry will be removed from the crontab.

---++ VDT 1.6.0 and earlier

Earlier versions of the VDT did not contain the ==vdt-control== script.  For these earlier versions of the VDT, it is necessary to stop the services by manually running the ==/etc/init.d== control scripts.  Some or all of the following will need to be run depending on what was installed on the system:

<pre class="screen">
> <b>service tomcat-5 stop </b>
> <b>service apache stop </b>
> <b>service voms stop </b>
> <b>service mysql stop </b>
> <b>service edg-crl-upgraded stop </b>
</pre>
