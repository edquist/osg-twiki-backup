---++What is gLexec and why do you need it
gLexec is adapted from apache's suexec to use grid credentials to run jobs as another 
user.  It is meant to be used by VO's that run pilot jobs.  In a pilot job one
user submits a job, either PANDA or Condor Glide-in, which then contacts the 
VO's server and requests a workload once it has gotten the slot.  gLexec is 
used to authenticate the workload and verify that it is an authorized user from 
the VO who has submitted the workload. 

gLexec has a number of authentication plugins and can be used both by 
EGEE LCAS/LCMAPS and by OSG with GUMS and SAZ.   It is an suid
program and thus must be installed on every single worker node individually. 
It cannot and must not be NFS-exported.  

***Note, however, that clever sysadmins can install gLexec on an NFS partition with the rest of the worker node client, 
and then copy the nfs-mounted glexec and related libraires to a local disk and point the pilots to this new binary.***

---++Pre-install steps for gLexec

<b>gLexec must be installed as root</b>.

You must create a <b>"glexec" local user</b> before you attempt the installation. gLexec uses it for privilege separation and installation will fail without.

Starting OSG1.0, gLexec also requires a range of <b>group ids</b> for tracking purposes. 
Set aside at least 3 group ids per batch slot. They must be consecutive, but else can be in any range 
(default range is 65000-65049).

---++Installing the gLexec package

It is recommended that the gLexec package be installed within the OSG
Worker Node Client area because most of its dependencies are the same 
as those within the worker node client.  
To install:

<pre class="screen">
# pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:Glexec
</pre>
The tail of the install will look like this:

</pre>

Note that the =setup.sh= file is not changed to put the =glexec= binary into your path.
The install will create config files under =/etc/glexec=, create the =/var/log/glexec=
directory if it does not exist, and change the =glexec= binary to be suid.  (If you do not
see these, check the vdt-install.log and the post-install README file.

Please also remember to install the CA Certificates as for every VDT install (procedure described in the post-install README file).

---++Post-install Configuration of gLexec
The following steps need to be executed manually after the 
=glexec= pacman install completes:

---+++Configure each node with host cert or proxy
Each node which is executing =glexec= needs to have either a host
certificate or a host proxy distributed from the gatekeeper.


If you don't have host certificates for the worker nodes,
there is a host proxy distribution script located at 
=http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/files/glexec/host_dist_latest.tgz=
which can be installed on your gatekeeper and will automatically create
a proxy from your gatekeeper's host certificate and push it out to =/etc/grid-security/hostproxy.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/hostproxykey.pem=.

If you use site centralized CA Cartificates distribution,
modify the =/etc/grid-security/certificates= directory to point to a set of current CA Certificates and CRL files.

---+++Modify /etc/glexec/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping.cfg

Modify the file =/etc/glexec/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping.cfg=
to point to the correct location of your GUMS server.  

The gums_url variable is the only variable you should have to change.

<pre class="screen">

</pre>

---+++ Using the new XACML2 GUMS interface 
Starting with this version of VDT, GUMS and PRIMA can use two different ways to communicate with each other  
   * the old PRIMA legacy protocol, based on SAML v1
   * the new XACML2 protocol defined by the OSG-EGEE interoperability group

The default installation (describe above) will, for backward compatibility reasons, use the old PRIMA legacy protocol.
However, if you installed GUMS v1.3.0 or later, you should switch to the new interface.

Modify the file =/etc/glexec/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping.cfg=, 
commenting out the default =map_exe= and =gums_url=, then
uncomment and configure the alternative one.

<pre class="screen">

---+++Modify /etc/glexec/tracking_groups.cfg

Modify the file =/etc/glexec/tracking_groups.cfg=
with the correct tracking group id range.
<pre class="screen">
# This file defines the range of GIDs
# used for tracking purposes
#
# Make sure this range of GIDs is not used for any other purpose
#
min_gid=65000
max_gid=65049
</pre>

---++Testing gLexec

Now as a non-privileged user, do the following (where "yourvo" is your vo, etc.):
<pre class="screen">
> bash
>  cd $VDT_LOCATION
>  source setup.sh
>  voms-proxy-init -voms yourvo:/yourvo -file /tmp/x509_xyz
> exit
> export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT=/tmp/x509_xyz
> $VDT_LOCATION/glexec-osg/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
It appears that the value of pthread_mutex_init is 10603520
uid=13160(fnalgrid) gid=9767(fnalgrid)
</pre>
If gLexec is successful, it will print out the uid and gid that your
proxy would normally be mapped to by your gums server.
The gLexec utility also has a process called glexec_monitor which 
runs as root through the life of the glexec'ed process..

---++About the gLexec log files
There are four gLexec log files that are made on each worker node and they have 
four different timestamp formats.  They all live by default in /var/log/glexec:
glexec_log, the main log of each glexec stamp, logs in GMT:
<pre>
glexec[14507]: 20080109T173203Z glexec pid: 14507

</pre>
