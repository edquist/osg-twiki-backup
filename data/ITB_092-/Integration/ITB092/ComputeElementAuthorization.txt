---++ Getting started with authorization
You'll need to determine which which mode of authorization to use for your CE.   Guidance on this is provided in [[AboutAuthorizationForCE][About Authorization For CE]].
   * A note about edg-mkgridmap.  In early releases of OSG, the =edg-mkgridmap= script ran as a system service and installed in =/etc/init.d=.  In newer releases it gets installed as a _root_ crontab entry.  If you are upgrading from an early OSG release, you must stop the edg-mkgridmap daemon and delete that entry from system services.  %NOTE% =edg-mkgridmap= is not installed/configured by default.

---++ Check supported VOs and Unix accounts
Beginning with OSG 0.6.0, one can verify that authorization works for the VOs supported, and that the required Unix accounts exist on the CE host.  This is further discussed in [[OsgSupportedVos][Supported VOs and Undefined UNIX Accounts]].

---++ Implement the authorization mode
We point you off to a separate page for each option:
   * [[Grid3ModeAuthorization][Local]] - for the local grid-mapfile mode.
   * [[CompatibilityModeAuthorization][Compatibility]] - also uses a grid-mapfile, but aided by a GUMS server.
   * [[FullPrivilegeAuthorization][Full Privilege]] - the (role-based) extended-proxy certificate authorization mode.
