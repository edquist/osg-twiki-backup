---++ Start with open questions

---+++ Supported methods to authenticate users
Anne to follow-up.
vivek noted the link from the install guide, I think he's referring to the link to
http://ivdgl.uits.indiana.edu/~rquick/install_guide/OsgCEAuthorization

Question: will gridmap file be supported in production?  Anne to ask Leigh, and maybe talk to Steven Tim.

---+++ Users' security responsibilities
D.Olson already notified to review.  Vivek suggested adding info about what would cause user to suspect a security event? (e.g., defaced web page) How would you notice unauthorized access? What are typical security events? Things like that...

---+++ Where to find documentation
Remove this question

---+++ Two monitoring questions: 
wait for Mark Green to respond, Fred will follow up.

---+++ OSG Organization
Anne to: link to the org web page (consortium link), and to add critcal email address(es) to kb page.

---+++ OSG s/w packaged and distributed
Tim to resolve.

---+++ ensure next release works on my system
(Anne) Ready to go.  Anne will alert Mary H.

---+++ Troubleshooting job
Done by Burt, reviewed by Fred, ready to go. Anne will alert Mary H.

---+++ start new vo
Anne to ask Leigh about the OSG VO -- it's not listed but Fred thinks IU is RA for it. Also Anne to look into SOP doc, get it moved out of twiki, then link to it. Then Anne to finish up answer and send to Mary H.  I should take comments out of the topquestions page and move them to here (comments about how to coordinate with the rest of the OSG website)

---+++ find out who's using my system
Still on Lisa's plate

---+++ what to do if security incident 
Fred to do.  Answer is "telephone the GOC"  Add definition of security incident (evidence of intrusion, defaced web page, unauth use of resources)  Maybe link to question above: user responsibility
Anne to ask Doug O about security tg policy for requiring particular security updates on CEs and/or client machines.

---++ Other topics (not questions for kb)
---+++ OSG KB Homepage
---++++ Add feedback link
Ideally would like feedback link on each kb page; may require interface change. Fred to ask John R to find out how big a job this is.

Anne thinks best not to add as boilerplate to each doc for ease of maintenance -- what if email address changes?

---++++ Search on OSG to get full list of kb docs.
Tim to add text on kb homepage about "to get full list, search on "osg".

Right now (1/18 4:16 CST) there are 19 docs:

In the OSG, what services are available? 
How do I subscribe to OSG mailing lists, and which lists should I subscribe to? 
In the OSG, what is a Virtual Organization? 
What is the Open Science Grid (OSG)? 
How can I find out who participates in the OSG? 
What should I do to shut down a previous version of the OSG before I upgrade? 
How do I get started using OSG? 
In the OSG, what is the Integration Grid? 
In the OSG, what is the Production Grid? 
What should I install on the worker nodes of my OSG compute element? 
Where can I find the OSG ITB CE Install Guide? 
How do I install the OSG client for use on my desktop? 
What should I name my OSG resource? 
How do I run a grid job using OSG? 
How do I install and use the Pacman software packaging tool? 
How do I get or renew a PKI Personal Certificate? 
What does a Condor submission script look like? 
Where can I find definitions for the terms used in grid computing? 
What is a certificate? 

Of Rob Q's 15 docs, which if any are already in? I can't recognize them.

---++++ Google search

Can kb pages be made to be world-readable and google-searchable?  Vivek tried it and said they already are.
I (Anne) just tried and didn't succeed. My results:

Search on osg knowlege base: yes, I get to kb home page

Search on  osg knowledge base certificate: I get to twiki "top question suggestions"

Search on osg certificate: get anl site, twiki, integration twiki, osg glossary, don't see kb.

Search on condor site:kb.grid.iu.edu: Nothing.

So NO, KB pages are NOT google-searchable, you can only find the kb home page.
So, what would it take to make them googlified?  Could there be a tag like osg:all on the public ones?  Anne will ask Mary H.
