---+ Suggested Questions for the OSG Knowledge Base

%TOC%
---++ From meeting 1/11/06
Goal for next week 11/18: have all the following q/a reviewed and ready to send to Mary H for inclusion in KB. Also, all the still-unready questions under the Dec 14 heading below.  Please add your text and your review comments directly to the twiki. Fred would like to show the KB at the January Gainesville OSG meeting.

Anne to check old email about outstanding problems with KB, check their status, and contact Mary (cc group) as needed.

Rob Q has about 15 docs in addition to Client Installation Guide to move to KB from Mambo. (Do these need review?) He'll send Client Inst guide to Tim, Tim will work with Mary to get it into KB.  May need 2 questions pointing to the answer: "client installation guide" and "how do I setup my desktop to run jobs". (Latter is under 12/14 heading.)

Tim to see about adding functionality to show whole list of questions in KB

Tim? to add link from OSG home page to KB home page (add text about "this is new/growing" or something. I don't think we want to say it's incomplete because by its nature, it always will be...)

Tim to add a feedback link to the KB pages (e.g. "Does this answer your question?") and link the mailto to osg-general.

Tim to write (under 12/14 section) "what to do if security event occurs"

Fred to review Burt's troubleshooting question, get the "setup Condor" answer reviewed by Alain Roy, and to ping Lisa about her "who's using my system" question.

KB is Google-searchable. (not discussed, or I missed it: Are we going to add a Google search button?)

Assignments:

---+++ What are the supported methods for authenticating users at a site?
(I didn't note an assignment for this one)

---+++ What are users' responsibilities regarding security on OSG?
Anne to write up, Doug O to review

---+++ Where can I find documentation for OSG?
(we ignored this one)

---+++ How can I monitor my job on OSG?
(Fred to send email to Mark Green to ask for help on this one)

---+++ What job monitoring tools does OSG support, and how do I get and use them?
(again, email to MLGreen)

---+++ How is OSG organized?
Anne to write up, Ruth to review first, then group

---+++ How is the OSG software packaged and distributed?
Tim -- point to existing KB doc about pacman, add link to pacman home page

---+++ How can I help ensure that the next release of OSG software runs on my systems?

We encourage you to participate in testing and validating the OSG software prior to its release. To do so, you need to participate in the Integration Test Bed and attend the weekly integration meetings.  To contact members of the integration group, send email to osg-int@opensciencegrid.org.



---++ Next five for week of Dec 14 (this keeping slipping)...
I think we agreed to try to have text or links in here ready for review by Wed Dec 14.


11/11/05 Notes from Anne: 

	* The query page for the kbase is at http://kb.grid.iu.edu/. We need to get it linked from OSG home. 

	* The kbase also includes the initial Q/A pages that Mary Hrovat wrote. These include: What is OSG, Who participates in OSG, What's a VO, What's the production grid, What's the integration grid, and What services are available.  So currently, we have her 6 + our initial 7 = 13 Q/A pages.  We need to decide if we want to keep these, and if so, what edits to make.  Remember our advice from IU: "Only make pages for what you need; think of each page as a continuing maintenance task." 

---+++ How do I troubleshoot my job if it does not run properly? (Burt)

There is a chain of events that must be successful in order for your job to run properly.

<b>Authentication</b>.  First, try <tt>globusrun -a -r gatekeeper.host.name</tt>.  This verifies that your grid proxy certificate is valid and that the site has authorized you.  If you don't have a proxy, you will see:
<pre>
gram_init failure:
GSS Major Status: General failure
GSS Minor Status Error Chain:
acquire_cred.c:gss_acquire_cred:125:
Error with GSI credential
Valid credentials could not be found in any of the possible locations specified by the credential search order.
</pre>
If your proxy has expired, you will see something like:
<pre>
gram_init failure:
GSS Major Status: General failure
GSS Minor Status Error Chain:
acquire_cred.c:gss_acquire_cred:125:
Error with GSI credential
globus_gsi_credential.c:globus_gsi_cred_read:305:
Error with credential: The proxy credential: /tmp/x509up_u12697
		with subject: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Burt Holzman 380062/CN=203059190
		expired 30 minutes ago.
</pre>

You can use <tt>grid-proxy-info</tt> or <tt>voms-proxy-info -all</tt> to query your current proxy certificate.
If the gatekeeper cannot be contacted (network is down, typo in hostname), you will see:

<pre>
GRAM Authentication test failure: connecting to the job manager failed.  Possible reasons: job terminated, invalid job contact, network problems, ...
</pre>

If the site is not configured to accept your certificate (for example, it may not support your VO!), you will see:
<pre>
GRAM Authentication test failure: authentication with the remote server failed
</pre>

If successful, it will report:
<pre>
GRAM Authentication test successful
</pre>

<b>Simple job on the fork queue</b>

<tt>globus-job-run gatekeeper.host.name/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id</tt>

Success will be the usual output from the <tt>id</tt> command.

<b>Simple job on the batch queue</b>

<tt>globus-job-run gatekeeper.host.name/jobmanager-condor /usr/bin/id</tt>
Modify <tt>jobmanager-condor</tt> to suit the batch queue you are submitting to (jobmanager-lsf, jobmanager-pbs, etc.)




Here are some common errors that result:
<pre>
error  7 : you are not in the gridmap
			  (ask the site admin to check edg-mkgridmap or gums.config)

error 12 : Network (firewall or /etc/hosts.allow) or something similar
			  (ask the site admin to check firewall or
				/etc/hosts.{allow,deny})

error 17 : WARNING: Invalid log file: "/usr/local/grid/globus/tmp/gram_job_state/gram_condor_log.30742.1128017695"
			  GRAM Job failed because the job failed when the job manager attempted to run it (error code 17)

			  Possible solution 
				 (a) Make sure the sub-directory globus/tmp/gram_job_state/ exists
				 (b) Make sure that the sub-directory has the correct priviliges - should be drwxrwxrwt
					  If it is not, chmod 1777 globus/tmp/gram_job_state/

error 25 : account to which your DN is mapped exists, but home directory
			  does not exist ?
			  (ask the site admin to create home dir)

error 47 : account to which your DN is mapped does not exist
			  (ask the site admin if your vo is supported and add the
				account) 
</pre>




---+++ How do I start a new VO?
Anne (Iwona has a "guinea pig" to try this out.) 

12/16/05
(
Note: various other pages will require changes due to the addition of this one:

	* VO Formation at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82
will be redundant and should just point here.

	* The section on "I want to form a VO" at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85#I_want_to_form_a_Virtual_Organiz
should have a pointer to here -- its text can remain essentially unchanged, though, I think.

	* The "What is a VO in OSG" knowledgebook page should add a pointer to here.
)


For a definition of Virtual Organization (VO) as used in OSG, see (link to "what is a VO").  To register your 
organization as a VO in OSG, complete the the OSG VO registration form. (link is
http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=71&elMenu=Grid%20Support)

The OSG requirements for VOs are as follows:

	* There must be at least one member organization of the VO that is already a member of or 
partner with the Open Science Grid Consortium.  
(I don't understand this requirement: some university or other group that's part of the prospective VO already
needs to be a member/partner of OSG?  Wouldn't that group already be in a different VO?)

	* The VO must implement a VO Membership Service which meets the requirements of an OSG 
Release, specifically, one that provides your full list of 
member DNs to edg-mkgridmap. The recommended service to deploy is the VDT VOMS from the OSG software release.
Small or initially forming VOs may request support for this from an existing VO in OSG.

	* The VO must identify or form a support organization (called a Support Center in OSG parlance) that will support
the VO in OSG Operations.  The Support Center must provide instructions to the VO's members on accessing OSG 
resources; in particular, how to obtain the required certificate(s) and which Certificate Authority and 
Registration Authority to use. Small or initially forming VOs may request support for this from an 
already existing VO in OSG.

	* The VO must identify web page(s) to OSG that describe the purpose/charter of the VO 
and the VO membership determination process.

	* The VO must complete the VO registration form.
http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=71&elMenu=Grid%20Support


The OSG Operations Activity will review the information. If there 
are no issues, they will notify the VO contact person and add support for the VO to the OSG software 
infrastructure, OSG operations and support activities, vo-admins 
mail list, and published web pages. If questions or issues arise, the 
Operations Activity will work with the Organization that is a member 
of or partner with the Consortium to resolve them (this goes back to my question above).
The Operations Activity will send email to the Interim Executive Board 
with information about the VO registration. The IEB has a 2 days to 
object to the registration.

http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/SOPVoRegistration-v3 (Dec 14, 2005)


I think asvj.html should also point to "I want to form a VO" instead of to "VO formation".

---+++ How do I find out who is using my system? (Which users?, Which V0?)
Lisa


---+++ What should I do if a security incident occurs on OSG?
Rob Q 

contact GOC immediately; find security contacts (don't make publicly available)

---+++ How do I setup condor?
Vivek  -- long method is on his twiki ([[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/VivekJainInstallGuideTips#Configuring_CONDOR link]]) (Terrence has shorter method?)




---++ Top five (well, 9 really) for week of Oct 3
By Monday Oct 24 at noon -- have revised answers "finalized".  Plan to finish review at Oct 26 meeting and send some to IU KB team.
Fred will send to IU KB by end of CERN business on Oct 27.

11/11/05 note from Anne: still to review: What kind of jobs can I run, How to disable user

Authors: make a note of "ready for review" when your content is at that point.
Reviewers: please put your comments on this page, and sign your name!

#QGetStart
---+++ How do I get started using OSG? 
(Burt, revised 10/26)

Before you get started, you should understand the underlying principle of OSG: to maximize the amount of resources and users
by keeping requirements for membership as minimal as possible.	Organizations in OSG may be interested in opportunistic
computing, dedicated computing, or a mixture of the two.  Every resource (cluster, storage, etc.) is not
guaranteed to be available to every single user on the grid.  You should then decide in what capacity you wish to participate.  There is
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85][official "Getting Started" documentation]] on how
to make that decision.

First, you'll need to get a certificate signed by an [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/LinkBrokenUntilVDTSiteUp][approved Certificate Authority]].  
For most U.S.-based researchers, the appropriate CA is DOE Grids.  See the [[#QGridCert][DOEGrid User certificate documentation]].

Every user in OSG is a member in a Virtual Organization ("VO").  A VO represents a group of users
with a common set of research interests, commonly an experimental collaboration such as 
the [[http://www.sdss.org/][Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] or the [[http://atlasexperiment.org/ATLAS][ATLAS physics experiment]].
A list of VOs is [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=83][available here]].
If you aren't part of an existing VO, you'll need to follow the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82][process for forming your own]].
<!-- A list updated daily of VOs is [[http://home.fnal.gov/~burt/vo-list.txt][available here]. -->

Next, you'll need to find a place to submit jobs from.  You can [[#QDesktopSubmit][configure your desktop]] to do so, or there
may be a common cluster at your site already configured by someone else in your VO.  You'll need to know [[#QKindJob][what kind of jobs]] you
can run on the grid and [[#QRunJob][how to submit your job]].

You are also required to contribute resources in some form (e.g. hardware, software, operations effort, etc.) to OSG.  The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85][official "Getting Started" documentation]] has more
information.

The most common resource is a Compute Element (CE).  CEs range in size from 
user's desktop machines (useful for testing, but not for production) to clusters spanning thousands of CPUs.
Here are [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=115][installation instructions for a new CE]].
If you are interested in testing, integrating, and developing leading-edge OSG services, you may wish to
join resources to the Integration Testbed instead; consult the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide][ITB installation instructions]].

---+++What is a certificate?

(Anne 10/19)

By "certificate" we mean a digital identity certificate, an electronic or digital signature that a computer program or service may require prior to access in order to authenticate the accessing entity. These certificates are based on PKI technology, where PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure, an arrangement which provides for third-party vetting of, and vouching for, user identities.  PKI uses a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt information securely.

Somebody has to issue you a certificate, and somebody else must decide whether to accept your certificate when you present it. This implies that there must be a "chain of trust" such that the "acceptor" trusts the "issuer". The issuer of a certificate is an organization called a Certificate Authority, abbreviated CA. The acceptors (e.g., grid services) maintain lists of issuers (CAs) that they trust. 

Certificates can pertain to different types of entities: persons, hosts and services, and CAs.  Personal certificates are sometimes called "grid certificates" because standard grid software requires authentication via certificates, but use of certificates is not restricted to grid computing. Other common uses include signing email messages and administering/accessing restricted web sites.

For more information see:

	* http://www.youdzone.com/signature.html David Youd's short, very informative cartoon intro to digital signatures and trust chains
	* http://www.nordugrid.org/documents/certificate_howto.html Nordugrid's Grid Certificate Mini How-to


#QGridCert
---+++ How do I get a PKI personal certificate (also called a grid user certificate)? 
(Anne)
See http://computing.fnal.gov/securitydev/pki/OSG-Get-DOEGrids-Cert.html. (Ready for review 10/11)

#QKindJob  
---+++What kind of jobs can I run on OSG? 
(Fred)

#QRunJob
---+++How do I run a grid job using OSG? 
(Vivek)


	* Before you can run a job, you have to be part of a VO (Virtual Organization). If you belong to one of the large VO's such as ATLAS, CMS, SDSS, LIGO, etc., please get in touch with the contact person for that VO. Many of these large VO's have their own custom packages used to submit jobs. Please see the list of VO's mentioned in the previous [[#QGetStart][section]]

	* Currently, the OSG sites support many different flavours of Linux, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Scientific Linux, so your job has to be able to run in such an environment. A full list is available [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=115#Operating_Systems here]].

	* You have to have the VDT Client software installed on the machine from where you will be submitting a job. Details on how to do this can be found [[#QDesktopSubmit][here]]. This software includes and uses %BLUE% condorG %ENDCOLOR% for job submission. Users are strongly encouraged to use condorG.

	* The assumption is that you will be running your job as a batch job. This implies that you need to know what batch system the remote site is running, since the submission command may be different. In the future, one whould be able to get this information from [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/ Gridcat]], but this is a work in progress. At the moment, you could write to the site adminstrator of a particular site to find out more details.

	* At the moment, you have to specify the site name where you want your job to run. There is no command (as yet) which will launch your job on any or all available machines, although it would be nice!!

	* If you are submitting your job on a machine which runs Condor, the simplest submission scripts could look something like [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/VivekJainSampleScripts sample_script]]. You submit the job by %BLUE% condor_submit [file_name] %ENDCOLOR%. Take a look at the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Condor]] website for details on the syntax of the file.
	  

#QDesktopSubmit
---+++How do I configure my desktop machine to submit jobs to OSG? 

(Iwona to review the Client Install Guide at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72&Itemid=65)

I provided feedback on pacman instructions and they reached Saul. Some instructions on the page listed above got fixed (Scientific Linux added as a valid option). I am about to repeat the installation exercise again. (Iwona)

---+++How do I subscribe to OSG mailing and which lists should I subscribe to as a user? a developer? an administrator? 

---++++How to join an OSG mailing list:

To subscribe to an OSG mailing list, send an email to listserv@opensciencegrid.org. The subject of the email should be blank.
In the body of the email, include the following (and only the following) statement:

==subscribe "Name of the Mailing List" last name, first name==

Do not include the quotes around the name of the mailing list - for example:

==subscribe OSG_DOCS Smith, John==

All OSG mailing lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain, so the address to post a message to the list is "Name of the Mailing List"@opensciencegrid.org - for example osg-general@opensciencegrid.org.

---++++Lists that a user might want to join

All users should join these two lists:

	<b>OSG</b> List used to post general OSG announcements.<br>
	<b>OSG-GENERAL</b> Community support for OSG. A place to ask questions and get help.<br>

Users running big productions may want to join this list:

	<b>OSG-OPS-STATUS</b> OSG Operations Status. Daily emails listing what sites are down.<br>

Users should generally first ask for help from their VO's Support Center before posting questions to the mailing lists.

---++++Lists that a developer might want to join

There are a number of lists that may be pertinent to a developer. All developers will want to join these two:

	<b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. For discussing deploying of new versions of OSG middleware.<br>
	<b>OSG-INT</b> Integration activity mailing list. For discussing work on test versions of the OSG middleware.<br>

Depending on what sort of code a developer is working on, subscribing to one or more of these lists may make sense:

	<b>OSG-BLUEPRINT</b> Blueprint Activity mailing list. For discussing the overall design of the OSG middleware.<br>
	<b>OSG-EDGESERVICES</b> Edge Services Activity mailing list. For discussion of deployment and integration of specialized services at the edge of a public/private network boundary, which act on the client’s behalf within the site’s private boundary.<br>
	<b>OSG-INTEROPERABILITY</b> Interoperability activity mailing list. Interoperation with LCG and <NOP>TeraGrid are discussed.<br>

	<b>TG-MIG</b> OSG Monitoring and Information Systems Group mailing list. Monitoring issues are discussed.<br>
	<b>TG-NETWORKS</b> Network Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-SUPPORTCENTERS</b> Support Centers Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-STORAGE</b> Storage Facilities mailing list.<br>

Note: Each activity's and technical group's mailing list is used to announce meetings of the activity or technical group.

---++++Lists that a site administrator might want to join

Site administrators should join these four lists:

	<b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. For discussing deploying of new versions of OSG middleware.<br>
	<b>OSG-OPERATIONS</b> Operations Activity mailing list. For discussing operations isseues such as open tickets and standard OSG operating procedures.<br>
	<b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>VO-ADMINS</b> OSG VO and GUMS Administrators mailing list. Issues with authorization at various sites are discussed.<br>


Note: Each activity's and technical group's mailing list is used to announce meetings of the activity or technical group.

---+++ How do I add or disable a user from using my system? 

 First we need to define "user". In the most simple grid case, a group of
 individual people are mapped to a single UNIX account. In more complicated
 authorization methods individuals can be mapped to individual UNIX accounts.
 Therefore when we speak of users we could mean the invidual person (e.g. Jane
 Smith) or the account that individual is mapped to (e.g. griduser01).

*Part A: To enable a user*

		  1) create the regular UNIX account the person is being mapped to if
			  does not already exist.
	* - entry in passwd file
	* - home directory created with correct permissions/ownership. This home dir needs to be accessible on the gatekeeper and all the worker nodes.

		  2) Entry in grid authorization service
	* - Simple authorization: entry in /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
						If you need to add an entry to this file manually you should
						note that it will be overwritten at the next automated update.
	* - Prima authorization: Entry in GUMS service for your site/resource
	* - Note that *should* be automated since each VO keeps the
						list of their users and certificates up to date. This information
						is then distributed to the CE's or gums servers involved in
						OSG automatically.

*Part B: To disable a user on my system*

	Part 1) Disabling jobs from running under a specific UNIX account (e.g. griduser01)
			  This is the simple case and it is very easy to do: remove the account
			  entry for that UNIX account from the passwd file on the gatekeeper.
	* - *Note* that if more than one person is mapped to this unix account,
						NONE of them will be able to run jobs.

	Part 2) Disabling jobs for an individual (e.g Jane Smith)
			  This is a little more complicated and is dependent on the authorization
			  method your CE is using.

	* 1) If the individual is mapped to a single Unix account you can use
				  the answer in Part 1.

	* 2) If you are using the grid-mapfile you can remove the users entry
				  in that file. Since the grid-mapfile is updated automatically though
				  you will have to implement something to filter out this user at
				  the next update.

	* 3) If you are using Prima authorization, the users entry can be removed
				  from the GUMS configuration but again this change will be overwritten
				  at the next automated GUMS update. The author's of GUMS have indicated
				  that a permanent solution to this will be available in the SAZ product.

---++ From Vivek Jain on 9/20/05

	* Is there a preferred/default way to set up a cluster? I use ROCKS to first make a cluster and then move on to installing OSG software. If we do it this way, it is recommended that the ROCKS head-node be a separate machine from the OSG Gatekeeper.

	* What are some recommended parameters for the cluster hardware? How many "boxes" do we need for service applications, e.g., GateKeeper, NFS server, GUMS server (see Q 5), etc.?

	* How to get a certificate? Which certificate are we talking about, user/host/service? My understanding is that one should first get a user certificate. For this step, someone has to vouch for you. How will this work for a person who wants to start a new VO? Once one has a user certificate, they can be put on a site-admin list, and this allows them to apply for host/service certificates on their own authority.

	* How to set up condor? As I mentioned before, this took me a long time and I needed a lot of help. Even then, I haven't done it optimally. I did too many things manually.

	* What is recommended way for authenticating users? I am still using the old method of a local grid-map file, but many are using GUMS. The latter approach may require a separate machine to act as the GUMS server.

Vivek is writing his experiences at:

---++ From Iwona Sakrejda on 9/20/05

Now there are many areas that have to be covered. I look at it as a person responsible
for configuring and running a computing or staorage element.

The scenario I am most familiar with is that somebody from Atlas or STAR approaches me and says:
Join the OSG. So now what my questons would be? Let's say I got only 6 questions to ask
- got to share those 50.....

	* What a sys admin should do to deliver a resource to OSG (install, test, instructions are here...)

	* What mailing lists to join to say informed and follow developments (new releases of production software).

	* How to know what problems people "see" at my site.

	* Where to look for help  resolving problems.

	* How to handle users trashing my site (contacts, cleanup scripts....)


Already those 5 would make my life much easier......
