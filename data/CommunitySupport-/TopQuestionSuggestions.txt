---+++What kind of jobs can I run on OSG? 

(Fred)

---+++How do I run a grid job using OSG? 

(Vivek)

This answer is a work in progress!

	* Before you can run a job, you have to be part of a VO (Virtual Organization). If you belong to one of the large VO's such as ATLAS, CMS, SDSS, etc., please get in touch with the contact person for that VO.

	* Currently, the OSG sites support versions of Unix/Linux, so your job has to be able to run in such an environment (%RED% *Is this true?* %ENDCOLOR%)

	* You have to have the VDT Client software installed on the machine from where you will be submitting a job. (%RED% *Is this true?* %ENDCOLOR%)

	* The assumption is that you will be running your job as a batch job. This implies that you need to know what batch system the remote site is running, since the submission command may be different.

	* At the moment, you have to specify the resource name where you want your job to run. There is no command (as yet) which will launch your job on any or all available machines, although it would be nice!!

	* If you are submitting your job on a machine which runs Condor, the simplest submission script will look something like this [[http://ahep.phy2.albany.edu/~vj/sample_submission.txt file]]. You submit the job by %BLUE% condor_submit <file_name> %ENDCOLOR%. Take a look at the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Condor]] website for details on the syntax of the file.
	  

---+++How do I configure my desktop machine to submit jobs to OSG? 

(Iwona to write, Anne to review)

---+++How do I subscribe to OSG mailing and which lists should I subscribe to as a user? a developer? an administrator? 

---++++How to join an OSG mailing list:

To subscribe to an OSG mailing list, send an email to listserv@fnal.gov.
In the body of the email, include the following statement:

==subscribe "Name of the Mailing List" last name, first name==

For example:

==subscribe OSG_DOCS Smith, John==

---++++Lists that a user might want to join:

	<b>OSG-GENERAL</b> Community support for OSG. A place to ask questions and get help.<br>
	<b>OSG-OPS-STATUS</b> OSG Operations Status. Daily emails listing what sites are down.<br>

Users should ask for help from their VO Support Center in addition to posting questions to the mailing lists.

---++++Lists that a developer might want to join:

There are a number of lists that may be pertinent to a developer:

	<b>OSG-BLUEPRINT</b> Blueprint Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity. Will have announcements of new software versions.<br>
	<b>OSG-DRM</b> DRM Activity mailing list.<br>
	<b>OSG-EDGESERVICES</b> Edge Services Activity mailing list.<br>
	<b>OSG-INT</b> Integration activity mailing list. Issues about test versions of the OSG middleware components are discussed.<br>
	<b>OSG-INTEROPERABILITY</b> Interoperability activity mailing list. Interoperation with LCG and TeraGrid are discussed.<br>
	<b>TG-MIG</b> OSG Monitoring and Information Systems Group mailing list. Monitoring issues are discussed.<br>
	<b>TG-NETWORKS</b> Network Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-STORAGE</b> Storage Facilities mailing list.<br>

---++++Lists that a site administrator might want to join:

	<b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. Will have announcements of new software versions.<br>
	<b>OSG-OPERATIONS</b> Operations Activity mailing list. Operations issues are discussed - where operations meetings are annouced.<br>
	<b>OSG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	(Is this this the right security list for administrators or is there another hidden list?)<br>
	<b>TG-SUPPORTCENTERS</b> Support Centers Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>VO-ADMINS</b> OSG VO and GUMS Administrators mailing list. Issues with authorization at various sites are discussed.<br>

---++ From Vivek Jain on 9/20/05

	* Is there a preferred/default way to set up a cluster? I use ROCKS to first make a cluster and then move on to installing OSG software. If we do it this way, it is recommended that the ROCKS head-node be a separate machine from the OSG Gatekeeper.

	* What are some recommended parameters for the cluster hardware? How many "boxes" do we need for service applications, e.g., GateKeeper, NFS server, GUMS server (see Q 5), etc.?

	* How to get a certificate? Which certificate are we talking about, user/host/service? My understanding is that one should first get a user certificate. For this step, someone has to vouch for you. How will this work for a person who wants to start a new VO? Once one has a user certificate, they can be put on a site-admin list, and this allows them to apply for host/service certificates on their own authority.

	* How to set up condor? As I mentioned before, this took me a long time and I needed a lot of help. Even then, I haven't done it optimally. I did too many things manually.

	* What is recommended way for authenticating users? I am still using the old method of a local grid-map file, but many are using GUMS. The latter approach may require a separate machine to act as the GUMS server.

---++ From Iwona Sakrejda on 9/20/05

Now there are many areas that have to be covered. I look at it as a person responsible
for configuring and running a computing or staorage element.

The scenario I am most familiar with is that somebody from Atlas or STAR approaches me and says:
Join the OSG. So now what my questons would be? Let's say I got only 6 questions to ask
- got to share those 50.....

	* What a sys admin should do to deliver a resource to OSG (install, test, instructions are here...)

	* What mailing lists to join to say informed and follow developments (new releases of production software).

	* How to know what problems people "see" at my site.

	* Where to look for help  resolving problems.

	* How to handle users trashing my site (contacts, cleanup scripts....)


Already those 5 would make my life much easier......
