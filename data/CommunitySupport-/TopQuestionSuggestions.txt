#QGetStart
---+++ How do I get started using OSG? 
(Burt, revised 10/26)

Before you get started, you should understand the underlying principle of OSG: to maximize the amount of resources and users
by keeping requirements for membership as minimal as possible.	Organizations in OSG may be interested in opportunistic
computing, dedicated computing, or a mixture of the two.  Every resource (cluster, storage, etc.) is not
guaranteed to be available to every single user on the grid.  You should then decide in what capacity you wish to participate.  There is
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85][official "Getting Started" documentation]] on how
to make that decision.

First, you'll need to get a certificate signed by an [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/LinkBrokenUntilVDTSiteUp][approved Certificate Authority]].  
For most U.S.-based researchers, the appropriate CA is DOE Grids.  See the [[#QGridCert][DOEGrid User certificate documentation]].

Every user in OSG is a member in a Virtual Organization ("VO").  A VO represents a group of users
with a common set of research interests, commonly an experimental collaboration such as 
the [[http://www.sdss.org/][Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] or the [[http://atlasexperiment.org/ATLAS][ATLAS physics experiment]].
A list of VOs is [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=83][available here]].
If you aren't part of an existing VO, you'll need to follow the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82][process for forming your own]].
<!-- A list updated daily of VOs is [[http://home.fnal.gov/~burt/vo-list.txt][available here]. -->

Next, you'll need to find a place to submit jobs from.  You can [[#QDesktopSubmit][configure your desktop]] to do so, or there
may be a common cluster at your site already configured by someone else in your VO.  You'll need to know [[#QKindJob][what kind of jobs]] you
can run on the grid and [[#QRunJob][how to submit your job]].

You are also required to contribute resources in some form (e.g. hardware, software, operations effort, etc.) to OSG.  The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85][official "Getting Started" documentation]] has more
information.

The most common resource is a Compute Element (CE).  CEs range in size from 
user's desktop machines (useful for testing, but not for production) to clusters spanning thousands of CPUs.
Here are [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=115][installation instructions for a new CE]].
If you are interested in testing, integrating, and developing leading-edge OSG services, you may wish to
join resources to the Integration Testbed instead; consult the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide][ITB installation instructions]].

---+++What is a certificate?

(Anne 10/19)

By "certificate" we mean a digital identity certificate, an electronic or digital signature that a computer program or service may require prior to access in order to authenticate the accessing entity. These certificates are based on PKI technology, where PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure, an arrangement which provides for third-party vetting of, and vouching for, user identities.  PKI uses a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt information securely.

Somebody has to issue you a certificate, and somebody else must decide whether to accept your certificate when you present it. This implies that there must be a "chain of trust" such that the "acceptor" trusts the "issuer". The issuer of a certificate is an organization called a Certificate Authority, abbreviated CA. The acceptors (e.g., grid services) maintain lists of issuers (CAs) that they trust. 

Certificates can pertain to different types of entities: persons, hosts and services, and CAs.  Personal certificates are sometimes called "grid certificates" because standard grid software requires authentication via certificates, but use of certificates is not restricted to grid computing. Other common uses include signing email messages and administering/accessing restricted web sites.

For more information see:

#QGridCert
---+++ How do I get a PKI personal certificate (also called a grid user certificate)? 
(Anne)
See http://computing.fnal.gov/securitydev/pki/OSG-Get-DOEGrids-Cert.html. (Ready for review 10/11)

#QKindJob  
---+++What kind of jobs can I run on OSG? 
(Fred)

#QRunJob
---+++How do I run a grid job using OSG? 
(Vivek)


	* Before you can run a job, you have to be part of a VO (Virtual Organization). If you belong to one of the large VO's such as ATLAS, CMS, SDSS, LIGO, etc., please get in touch with the contact person for that VO. Many of these large VO's have their own custom packages used to submit jobs. Please see the list of VO's mentioned in the previous [[#QGetStart][section]]

	* Currently, the OSG sites support many different flavours of Linux, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Scientific Linux, so your job has to be able to run in such an environment. A full list is available [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=115#Operating_Systems here]].

	* You have to have the VDT Client software installed on the machine from where you will be submitting a job. Details on how to do this can be found [[#QDesktopSubmit][here]]. This software includes and uses %BLUE% condorG %ENDCOLOR% for job submission. Users are strongly encouraged to use condorG.

	* The assumption is that you will be running your job as a batch job. This implies that you need to know what batch system the remote site is running, since the submission command may be different. In the future, one whould be able to get this information from [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/ Gridcat]], but this is a work in progress. At the moment, you could write to the site adminstrator of a particular site to find out more details.

	* At the moment, you have to specify the site name where you want your job to run. There is no command (as yet) which will launch your job on any or all available machines, although it would be nice!!

	* If you are submitting your job on a machine which runs Condor, the simplest submission scripts could look something like [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/VivekJainSampleScripts sample_script]]. You submit the job by %BLUE% condor_submit [file_name] %ENDCOLOR%. Take a look at the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Condor]] website for details on the syntax of the file.
	  

#QDesktopSubmit
---+++How do I configure my desktop machine to submit jobs to OSG? 

(Iwona to review the Client Install Guide at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72&Itemid=65)

I provided feedback on pacman instructions and they reached Saul. Some instructions on the page listed above got fixed (Scientific Linux added as a valid option). I am about to repeat the installation exercise again. (Iwona)

---+++How do I subscribe to OSG mailing and which lists should I subscribe to as a user? a developer? an administrator? 

---++++How to join an OSG mailing list:

To subscribe to an OSG mailing list, send an email to listserv@opensciencegrid.org. The subject of the email should be blank.
In the body of the email, include the following (and only the following) statement:

==subscribe "Name of the Mailing List" last name, first name==

Do not include the quotes around the name of the mailing list - for example:

==subscribe OSG_DOCS Smith, John==

All OSG mailing lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain, so the address to post a message to the list is "Name of the Mailing List"@opensciencegrid.org - for example osg-general@opensciencegrid.org.

---++++Lists that a user might want to join

All users should join these two lists:

	<b>OSG</b> List used to post general OSG announcements.<br>
	<b>OSG-GENERAL</b> Community support for OSG. A place to ask questions and get help.<br>

Users running big productions may want to join this list:

	<b>OSG-OPS-STATUS</b> OSG Operations Status. Daily emails listing what sites are down.<br>

Users should generally first ask for help from their VO's Support Center before posting questions to the mailing lists.

---++++Lists that a developer might want to join

There are a number of lists that may be pertinent to a developer. All developers will want to join these two:

	<b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. For discussing deploying of new versions of OSG middleware.<br>
	<b>OSG-INT</b> Integration activity mailing list. For discussing work on test versions of the OSG middleware.<br>

Depending on what sort of code a developer is working on, subscribing to one or more of these lists may make sense:

	<b>OSG-BLUEPRINT</b> Blueprint Activity mailing list. For discussing the overall design of the OSG middleware.<br>
	<b>OSG-EDGESERVICES</b> Edge Services Activity mailing list. For discussion of deployment and integration of specialized services at the edge of a public/private network boundary, which act on the client’s behalf within the site’s private boundary.<br>
	<b>OSG-INTEROPERABILITY</b> Interoperability activity mailing list. Interoperation with LCG and <NOP>TeraGrid are discussed.<br>

	<b>TG-MIG</b> OSG Monitoring and Information Systems Group mailing list. Monitoring issues are discussed.<br>
	<b>TG-NETWORKS</b> Network Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-SUPPORTCENTERS</b> Support Centers Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>TG-STORAGE</b> Storage Facilities mailing list.<br>

Note: Each activity's and technical group's mailing list is used to announce meetings of the activity or technical group.

---++++Lists that a site administrator might want to join

Site administrators should join these four lists:

	<b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. For discussing deploying of new versions of OSG middleware.<br>
	<b>OSG-OPERATIONS</b> Operations Activity mailing list. For discussing operations isseues such as open tickets and standard OSG operating procedures.<br>
	<b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
	<b>VO-ADMINS</b> OSG VO and GUMS Administrators mailing list. Issues with authorization at various sites are discussed.<br>


Note: Each activity's and technical group's mailing list is used to announce meetings of the activity or technical group.

---++ From Vivek Jain on 9/20/05

	* Is there a preferred/default way to set up a cluster? I use ROCKS to first make a cluster and then move on to installing OSG software. If we do it this way, it is recommended that the ROCKS head-node be a separate machine from the OSG Gatekeeper.

	* What are some recommended parameters for the cluster hardware? How many "boxes" do we need for service applications, e.g., GateKeeper, NFS server, GUMS server (see Q 5), etc.?

	* How to get a certificate? Which certificate are we talking about, user/host/service? My understanding is that one should first get a user certificate. For this step, someone has to vouch for you. How will this work for a person who wants to start a new VO? Once one has a user certificate, they can be put on a site-admin list, and this allows them to apply for host/service certificates on their own authority.

	* How to set up condor? As I mentioned before, this took me a long time and I needed a lot of help. Even then, I haven't done it optimally. I did too many things manually.

	* What is recommended way for authenticating users? I am still using the old method of a local grid-map file, but many are using GUMS. The latter approach may require a separate machine to act as the GUMS server.

---++ From Iwona Sakrejda on 9/20/05

Now there are many areas that have to be covered. I look at it as a person responsible
for configuring and running a computing or staorage element.

The scenario I am most familiar with is that somebody from Atlas or STAR approaches me and says:
Join the OSG. So now what my questons would be? Let's say I got only 6 questions to ask
- got to share those 50.....

	* What a sys admin should do to deliver a resource to OSG (install, test, instructions are here...)

	* What mailing lists to join to say informed and follow developments (new releases of production software).

	* How to know what problems people "see" at my site.

	* Where to look for help  resolving problems.

	* How to handle users trashing my site (contacts, cleanup scripts....)


Already those 5 would make my life much easier......
