---+++ What are the supported methods for authenticating users at a site?

Anne:Will be part of http://kb.grid.iu.edu/data/atia.html, of the title "How do I provide authorization for users to my OSG compute element?"

Leigh's answer to "question at our meeting today about whether gridmap will be supported in production":

If a resource is not using "Prima callout" then the /etc/grid-security/gridmap is used by the GRAM and the GSIFTP programs to authorize incoming authorization requests.

There are two senerios where this is used:

   * (Grid3 conf) Using /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded to
      pull VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS information directly from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo VOMS's into the gridmap.

   * (Compatibility conf) Using the GUMS client script as below:  

     $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin//gums-host generateGridMapfile

    This is executed on the CE and connects with the (local) GUMS server,
    specificed in the gums-client.properties file, and outputs to the 
    gridmap file.

(Anne 1/20) this seems to jive with http://kb.grid.iu.edu/data/atia.html. Maybe no updates needed.

Reviewed by Main.FrederickLuehring - 18 Jan 2006

Re-write below by Main.DougOlson - 31 Jan 2006 (minor edits by AH 2/1)

As a user of OSG you are responsible for three aspects of security: 
   1 protecting your grid identity token, 
   2 abiding by the policies of your Virtual Organization that authorizes access to resources, and 
   3 reporting known or suspected breaches of security.

1. The grid identity token for most users is a PKI X509 digital certificate with a lifetime of one year and a private key to which only the user has access.  Protecting your grid identity means protecting your private key so that no one else is able to use (or misuse) it. Typically the private key is stored in a file called $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem.  The (public) certificate needs to be accessible to parties and resources to which you'll need to authenticate yourself. It is typically stored in a file called $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem. 

To protect your private key, please follow these security guidelines with respect to your userkey.pem file: 
   * Copy userkey.pem to and/or store it only in a file that is accessible to yourself alone, i.e., to which no one else has privileges.  In particular:
   * DO NOT keep unnecessary copies of it.
   * DO NOT copy it to or store it in AFS or other shared file system.
   * DO NOT copy it to or store it in a directory that is accessible to the network.
   * The private key must be encrypted with a suitably complex passphrase that only you know.
   * Typical unix permissions should be 0400, readable only by owner.

You may also keep a copy of your certificate and private key in your web browser.  Here, too, the private key must be encrypted using the features of your browser for encrypting keys and passwords. For Mozilla/Firefox this is called the Master Password of the Software Security Device.

If your private key gets compromised, please revoke your certificate immediately and get a new one (link to asvn.html "how to get cert").  If your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo does not provide instructions on revoking your certificate, then you should contact the RA that issued the certificate, or directly contact the CA who issued it.

2. Every VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo through which you access OSG resources has a science mission for which use of these resources is allowed.  If you use OSG resources in a manner that is not directly or indirectly meeting the purpose of your VO, then you are in violation of the OSG acceptable use policy (AUP), and your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo can suspend your access to OSG resources.

3. If you suspect or have knowledge of a security incident, please report it immediately to your local OSG grid security contact. (link to instructions)

Published.

We encourage you to participate in testing and validating the OSG software prior to its release. To do so, you need to participate in the Integration Test Bed and attend the weekly integration meetings.  To contact members of the integration group, send email to osg-int@opensciencegrid.org.



---++ Next five for week of Dec 14 (this keeping slipping)...
I think we agreed to try to have text or links in here ready for review by Wed Dec 14.


11/11/05 Notes from Anne: (resolved)

   * The query page for the kbase is at http://kb.grid.iu.edu/. We need to get it linked from OSG home. 

   * The kbase also includes the initial Q/A pages that Mary Hrovat wrote. These include: What is OSG, Who participates in OSG, What's a VO, What's the production grid, What's the integration grid, and What services are available.  So currently, we have her 6 + our initial 7 = 13 Q/A pages.  We need to decide if we want to keep these, and if so, what edits to make.  Remember our advice from IU: "Only make pages for what you need; think of each page as a continuing maintenance task." 

---+++ How do I troubleshoot my job if it does not run properly? (Burt)
Published

There is a chain of events that must be successful in order for your job to run properly.

<b>Authentication</b><br>

You obtain a valid grid proxy using the <tt>grid-proxy-init -cert certfile -key keyfile</tt> so that you are authorized to use grid resources. In order for this to work you must have a grid certificate. See "How to get a grid certificate" if you don't have a grid certificate.<br>
 
First to confirm that your are authorized to use the grid by trying <tt>globusrun -a -r gatekeeper.host.name</tt>.  This verifies that your grid proxy certificate is valid and that the site has authorized you.  If you don't have a proxy, you will see:
<pre>
gram_init failure:
GSS Major Status: General failure
GSS Minor Status Error Chain:
acquire_cred.c:gss_acquire_cred:125:
Error with GSI credential
Valid credentials could not be found in any of the possible locations specified by the credential search order.
</pre>
If your proxy has expired, you will see something like:
<pre>
gram_init failure:
GSS Major Status: General failure
GSS Minor Status Error Chain:
acquire_cred.c:gss_acquire_cred:125:
Error with GSI credential
globus_gsi_credential.c:globus_gsi_cred_read:305:
Error with credential: The proxy credential: /tmp/x509up_u12697
      with subject: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Burt Holzman 380062/CN=203059190
      expired 30 minutes ago.
</pre>

You can use <tt>grid-proxy-info</tt> or <tt>voms-proxy-info -all</tt> to query your current proxy certificate.
If the gatekeeper cannot be contacted (network is down, typo in hostname), you will see:

<pre>
GRAM Authentication test failure: connecting to the job manager failed.  Possible reasons: job terminated, invalid job contact, network problems, ...
</pre>

If the site is not configured to accept your certificate (for example, it may not support your VO!), you will see:
<pre>
GRAM Authentication test failure: authentication with the remote server failed
</pre>

If successful, it will report:
<pre>
GRAM Authentication test successful
</pre>

<b>Simple job on the fork queue</b>

<tt>globus-job-run gatekeeper.host.name/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id</tt>

Success will be the usual output from the <tt>id</tt> command.

<b>Simple job on the batch queue</b>

<tt>globus-job-run gatekeeper.host.name/jobmanager-condor /usr/bin/id</tt><br>

You must modify <tt>jobmanager-condor</tt> to suit the batch queue you are submitting to (jobmanager-lsf, jobmanager-pbs, etc.). Again Success will be the usual output from the <tt>id</tt> command.




Here are some common errors that result:
<pre>
error  7 : you are not in the gridmap
           (ask the site admin to check edg-mkgridmap or gums.config)

error 12 : Network (firewall or /etc/hosts.allow) or something similar
           (ask the site admin to check firewall or
            /etc/hosts.{allow,deny})

error 17 : WARNING: Invalid log file: "/usr/local/grid/globus/tmp/gram_job_state/gram_condor_log.30742.1128017695"
           GRAM Job failed because the job failed when the job manager attempted to run it (error code 17)

           Possible solution 
             (a) Make sure the sub-directory globus/tmp/gram_job_state/ exists
             (b) Make sure that the sub-directory has the correct priviliges - should be drwxrwxrwt
                 If it is not, chmod 1777 globus/tmp/gram_job_state/

error 25 : account to which your DN is mapped exists, but home directory
           does not exist ?
           (ask the site admin to create home dir)

error 47 : account to which your DN is mapped does not exist
           (ask the site admin if your vo is supported and add the
            account) 
</pre>

12/16/05 (updated 1/16/06 after Ruth answered questions)
(
%RED%Note: various other pages will require changes due to the addition of this one: (need to inform OSG-docs group!)

   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Formation at (old link) http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82
will be redundant and should just point here.

   * The section on "I want to form a VO" at (old link) http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85#I_want_to_form_a_Virtual_Organiz
should have a pointer to here -- its text can remain essentially unchanged, though, I think.

   * The "What is a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG" knowledgebook page should add a pointer to here, and 1/16 I propose changes to text (http://kb.grid.iu.edu/data/arsa.html); see the end of this section

   * I think asvj.html should also point to "I want to form a VO" instead of to "VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo formation". %ENDCOLOR%

*Begin text for KB document "How do I start a new VO?":*

For a definition of Virtual Organization (VO) as used in OSG, see (link to "what is a VO").  

To register your 
organization as a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG, read the requirements below, then complete the the OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration form. (old link is
http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=71&elMenu=Grid%20Support)

The OSG requirements for VOs are as follows:

   * There must be at least one member organization of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo that is already a member of or partner with the Open Science Grid Consortium (link to What is Virtual Org in OSG KB page, and (old) link to current list of VOs at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=67#Current)

   * If there is no existing connection with OSG and the above requirement cannot be met, then an engagement period is required. At least one member organization of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must participate in OSG to establish a recognized contribution or potential in the eyes of the OSG council members prior to joining OSG.  The member organization would need to join one of the "umbrella" VOs temporarily in order to complete this engagement process. The umbrella VOs include iVDGL, and Fermilab. (where to link? List of VOs at (old link) http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=61&Itemid=83 doesn't include Fermilab) 

   * The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must implement a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Membership Service which meets the requirements of an OSG Release, specifically, a service that provides the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's full list of member DNs to edg-mkgridmap. The recommended service to deploy is the VDT VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS from the OSG software release. Small or initially-forming VOs may request support for this from an existing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG.

   * The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must identify or form a support organization (called a Support Center in OSG parlance) that will support the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG Operations.  The Support Center must provide instructions to the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's members on accessing OSG resources; in particular, how to obtain the required certificate(s) and which Certificate Authority and Registration Authority to use. Small or initially forming VOs may request support for this from an already existing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG.

   * The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must identify web page(s) to OSG that describe the purpose/charter of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership determination process.

   * The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must complete the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration form at (old link) http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=71&elMenu=Grid%20Support


The OSG Operations Activity will review the information. If there are no issues to resolve, this group will notify the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo contact person and add support for the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to the OSG software infrastructure, OSG operations and support activities, vo-admins 
mail list, and published web pages. If questions or issues arise, the Operations Activity will work with the organization (within the VO) that is a member of or partner with the OSG Consortium in order to resolve them. The Operations Activity will send email to the Interim Executive Board (IEB) with information about the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration. The IEB has two days to object to the registration.

%RED%Proposed new text for "what is a VO" at http://kb.grid.iu.edu/data/arsa.html 

Feb 3, 06 (AH): Vivek will take this over and talk with Ruth about it; he found nice illustration at <a href ="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.gridsummit.com/images/Figure21_2.PNG&imgrefurl=http://www.gridsummit.com/Excerpts/Grid2Security_part1b.htm&h=532&w=576&sz=62&tbnid=TjqU6oUN4ey9MM:&tbnh=121&tbnw=132&hl=en&start=72&prev=/images%3Fq%3D%2522Virtual%2BOrganization%2522%26start%3D60%26svnum%3D10%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26sa%3DN">link</a>
%ENDCOLOR%

Users of the Open Science Grid (OSG) are required to band together into Virtual Organizations (VOs). OSG does not currently support individual researchers. VOs are by their nature overlapping. VOs can include groups that are in other VOs. For example Fermilab is a member of (a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo within?) OSG.  People at Fermilab  are in one or more of  the  D0, CDF, CMS VOs. CMS, in turn, could also be part of (or, in principle, encompass) a CERN VO.  

As defined in the OSG Blueprint, a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo can include users, resources, and services. A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must be willing and able to contribute to OSG. OSG operates much as a "wholesaler" network, and VOs are expected to provide the "retailer" functions to their users (all user support, debugging assistance, etc.). In the future there may be an OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo for groups lacking the wherewithal for a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo management infrastructure; however, at this time, none of the consortium participants is able to provide this service.

Each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG must include at least one organization that is a member or partner of the OSG Consortium. See the current list of OSG VOs. If you are associated with a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo listed there, please contact its support center for further assistance. If you are not, and would like to form your own VO, consult the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Formation page. (point that link to the new "how to form a VO" kb page).

#QGetStart
---+++ How do I get started using OSG? 
(Burt, revised 10/26)

Before you get started, you should understand the underlying principle of OSG: to maximize the amount of resources and users
by keeping requirements for membership as minimal as possible.   Organizations in OSG may be interested in opportunistic
computing, dedicated computing, or a mixture of the two.  Every resource (cluster, storage, etc.) is not
guaranteed to be available to every single user on the grid.  You should then decide in what capacity you wish to participate.  There is
official "Getting Started" documentation on how
to make that decision.

First, you'll need to get a certificate signed by an [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/LinkBrokenUntilVDTSiteUp][approved Certificate Authority]].  
For most U.S.-based researchers, the appropriate CA is DOE Grids.  See the [[#QGridCert][DOEGrid User certificate documentation]].

Every user in OSG is a member in a Virtual Organization ("VO").  A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo represents a group of users
with a common set of research interests, commonly an experimental collaboration such as 
the [[http://www.sdss.org/][Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] or the [[http://atlasexperiment.org/ATLAS][ATLAS physics experiment]].
A list of VOs is [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=83][available here]] (old link).
If you aren't part of an existing VO, you'll need to follow the (old links) [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82][process for forming your own]].
<!-- A list updated daily of VOs is [[http://home.fnal.gov/~burt/vo-list.txt][available here]. -->

Next, you'll need to find a place to submit jobs from.  You can [[#QDesktopSubmit][configure your desktop]] to do so, or there
may be a common cluster at your site already configured by someone else in your VO.  You'll need to know [[#QKindJob][what kind of jobs]] you
can run on the grid and [[#QRunJob][how to submit your job]].

You are also required to contribute resources in some form (e.g. hardware, software, operations effort, etc.) to OSG.  The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=63&Itemid=85][official "Getting Started" documentation]] has more
information.

The most common resource is a Compute Element (CE).  CEs range in size from 
user's desktop machines (useful for testing, but not for production) to clusters spanning thousands of CPUs.
Here are installation instructions for a new CE]](in twiki).
If you are interested in testing, integrating, and developing leading-edge OSG services, you may wish to
join resources to the Integration Testbed instead; consult the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide][ITB installation instructions]].

---+++What is a certificate?

(Anne 10/19)

By "certificate" we mean a digital identity certificate, an electronic or digital signature that a computer program or service may require prior to access in order to authenticate the accessing entity. These certificates are based on PKI technology, where PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure, an arrangement which provides for third-party vetting of, and vouching for, user identities.  PKI uses a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) to encrypt and decrypt information securely.

Somebody has to issue you a certificate, and somebody else must decide whether to accept your certificate when you present it. This implies that there must be a "chain of trust" such that the "acceptor" trusts the "issuer". The issuer of a certificate is an organization called a Certificate Authority, abbreviated CA. The acceptors (e.g., grid services) maintain lists of issuers (CAs) that they trust. 

Certificates can pertain to different types of entities: persons, hosts and services, and CAs.  Personal certificates are sometimes called "grid certificates" because standard grid software requires authentication via certificates, but use of certificates is not restricted to grid computing. Other common uses include signing email messages and administering/accessing restricted web sites.

For more information see:

#QKindJob  
---+++What kind of jobs can I run on OSG? 
(Fred)

#QRunJob
---+++How do I run a grid job using OSG? 
(Vivek)


   * Before you can run a job, you have to be part of a VO (Virtual Organization). If you belong to one of the large VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's such as ATLAS, CMS, SDSS, LIGO, etc., please get in touch with the contact person for that VO. Many of these large VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's have their own custom packages used to submit jobs. Please see the list of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's mentioned in the previous [[#QGetStart][section]]

   * Currently, the OSG sites support many different flavours of Linux, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 or Scientific Linux, so your job has to be able to run in such an environment. A full list is available (old link) [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=115#Operating_Systems here]].

   * You have to have the VDT Client software installed on the machine from where you will be submitting a job. Details on how to do this can be found [[#QDesktopSubmit][here]]. This software includes and uses %BLUE% condorG %ENDCOLOR% for job submission. Users are strongly encouraged to use condorG.

   * The assumption is that you will be running your job as a batch job. This implies that you need to know what batch system the remote site is running, since the submission command may be different. In the future, one whould be able to get this information from [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/ Gridcat]], but this is a work in progress. At the moment, you could write to the site adminstrator of a particular site to find out more details.

   * At the moment, you have to specify the site name where you want your job to run. There is no command (as yet) which will launch your job on any or all available machines, although it would be nice!!

   * If you are submitting your job on a machine which runs Condor, the simplest submission scripts could look something like [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/VivekJainSampleScripts sample_script]]. You submit the job by %BLUE% condor_submit [file_name] %ENDCOLOR%. Take a look at the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/ Condor]] website for details on the syntax of the file.
     

#QDesktopSubmit

(Iwona to review the Client Install Guide at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=72&Itemid=65)

I provided feedback on pacman instructions and they reached Saul. Some instructions on the page listed above got fixed (Scientific Linux added as a valid option). I am about to repeat the installation exercise again. (Iwona)

---+++How do I subscribe to OSG mailing and which lists should I subscribe to as a user? a developer? an administrator? 

---++++How to join an OSG mailing list:

To subscribe to an OSG mailing list, send an email to listserv@opensciencegrid.org. The subject of the email should be blank.
In the body of the email, include the following (and only the following) statement:

==subscribe "Name of the Mailing List" last name, first name==

Do not include the quotes around the name of the mailing list - for example:

==subscribe OSG_DOCS Smith, John==

All OSG mailing lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain, so the address to post a message to the list is "Name of the Mailing List"@opensciencegrid.org - for example osg-general@opensciencegrid.org.

---++++Lists that a user might want to join

All users should join these two lists:

   <b>OSG</b> List used to post general OSG announcements.<br>
   <b>OSG-GENERAL</b> Community support for OSG. A place to ask questions and get help.<br>

Users running big productions may want to join this list:

   <b>OSG-OPS-STATUS</b> OSG Operations Status. Daily emails listing what sites are down.<br>

Users should generally first ask for help from their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's Support Center before posting questions to the mailing lists.

---++++Lists that a developer might want to join

There are a number of lists that may be pertinent to a developer. All developers will want to join these two:

   <b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. For discussing deploying of new versions of OSG middleware.<br>
   <b>OSG-INT</b> Integration activity mailing list. For discussing work on test versions of the OSG middleware.<br>

Depending on what sort of code a developer is working on, subscribing to one or more of these lists may make sense:

   <b>OSG-BLUEPRINT</b> Blueprint Activity mailing list. For discussing the overall design of the OSG middleware.<br>
   <b>OSG-EDGESERVICES</b> Edge Services Activity mailing list. For discussion of deployment and integration of specialized services at the edge of a public/private network boundary, which act on the client’s behalf within the site’s private boundary.<br>
   <b>OSG-INTEROPERABILITY</b> Interoperability activity mailing list. Interoperation with LCG and <NOP>TeraGrid are discussed.<br>

   <b>TG-MIG</b> OSG Monitoring and Information Systems Group mailing list. Monitoring issues are discussed.<br>
   <b>TG-NETWORKS</b> Network Technical Group mailing list.<br>
   <b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
   <b>TG-SUPPORTCENTERS</b> Support Centers Technical Group mailing list.<br>
   <b>TG-STORAGE</b> Storage Facilities mailing list.<br>

Note: Each activity's and technical group's mailing list is used to announce meetings of the activity or technical group.

---++++Lists that a site administrator might want to join

Site administrators should join these four lists:

   <b>OSG-DEPLOYMENT</b> Deployment Activity mailing list. For discussing deploying of new versions of OSG middleware.<br>
   <b>OSG-OPERATIONS</b> Operations Activity mailing list. For discussing operations isseues such as open tickets and standard OSG operating procedures.<br>
   <b>TG-SECURITY</b> Security Technical Group mailing list.<br>
   <b>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-ADMINS</b> OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and GUMS Administrators mailing list. Issues with authorization at various sites are discussed.<br>


Note: Each activity's and technical group's mailing list is used to announce meetings of the activity or technical group.

---+++ How do I add or disable a user from using my system? 

 First we need to define "user". In the most simple grid case, a group of
 individual people are mapped to a single UNIX account. In more complicated
 authorization methods individuals can be mapped to individual UNIX accounts.
 Therefore when we speak of users we could mean the invidual person (e.g. Jane
 Smith) or the account that individual is mapped to (e.g. griduser01).

*Part A: To enable a user*

        1) create the regular UNIX account the person is being mapped to if
           does not already exist.
   * - entry in passwd file
   * - home directory created with correct permissions/ownership. This home dir needs to be accessible on the gatekeeper and all the worker nodes.

        2) Entry in grid authorization service
   * - Simple authorization: entry in /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
                  If you need to add an entry to this file manually you should
                  note that it will be overwritten at the next automated update.
   * - Prima authorization: Entry in GUMS service for your site/resource
   * - Note that *should* be automated since each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo keeps the
                  list of their users and certificates up to date. This information
                  is then distributed to the CE's or gums servers involved in
                  OSG automatically.

*Part B: To disable a user on my system*

   Part 1) Disabling jobs from running under a specific UNIX account (e.g. griduser01)
           This is the simple case and it is very easy to do: remove the account
           entry for that UNIX account from the passwd file on the gatekeeper.
   * - *Note* that if more than one person is mapped to this unix account,
                  NONE of them will be able to run jobs.

   Part 2) Disabling jobs for an individual (e.g Jane Smith)
           This is a little more complicated and is dependent on the authorization
           method your CE is using.

   * 1) If the individual is mapped to a single Unix account you can use
              the answer in Part 1.

   * 2) If you are using the grid-mapfile you can remove the users entry
              in that file. Since the grid-mapfile is updated automatically though
              you will have to implement something to filter out this user at
              the next update.

   * 3) If you are using Prima authorization, the users entry can be removed
              from the GUMS configuration but again this change will be overwritten
              at the next automated GUMS update. The author's of GUMS have indicated
              that a permanent solution to this will be available in the SAZ product.

---++ From Vivek Jain on 9/20/05

   * Is there a preferred/default way to set up a cluster? I use ROCKS to first make a cluster and then move on to installing OSG software. If we do it this way, it is recommended that the ROCKS head-node be a separate machine from the OSG Gatekeeper.

   * What are some recommended parameters for the cluster hardware? How many "boxes" do we need for service applications, e.g., GateKeeper, NFS server, GUMS server (see Q 5), etc.?

   * How to get a certificate? Which certificate are we talking about, user/host/service? My understanding is that one should first get a user certificate. For this step, someone has to vouch for you. How will this work for a person who wants to start a new VO? Once one has a user certificate, they can be put on a site-admin list, and this allows them to apply for host/service certificates on their own authority.

   * How to set up condor? As I mentioned before, this took me a long time and I needed a lot of help. Even then, I haven't done it optimally. I did too many things manually.

   * What is recommended way for authenticating users? I am still using the old method of a local grid-map file, but many are using GUMS. The latter approach may require a separate machine to act as the GUMS server.

---++ From Iwona Sakrejda on 9/20/05

Now there are many areas that have to be covered. I look at it as a person responsible
for configuring and running a computing or staorage element.

The scenario I am most familiar with is that somebody from Atlas or STAR approaches me and says:
Join the OSG. So now what my questons would be? Let's say I got only 6 questions to ask
- got to share those 50.....

   * What a sys admin should do to deliver a resource to OSG (install, test, instructions are here...)

   * What mailing lists to join to say informed and follow developments (new releases of production software).

   * How to know what problems people "see" at my site.

   * Where to look for help  resolving problems.

   * How to handle users trashing my site (contacts, cleanup scripts....)


Already those 5 would make my life much easier......
