---++ From Vivek Jain on 9/20/05

	* Is there a preferred/default way to set up a cluster? I use ROCKS to first make a cluster and then move on to installing OSG software. If we do it this way, it is recommended that the ROCKS head-node be a separate machine from the OSG Gatekeeper.

	* What are some recommended parameters for the cluster hardware? How many "boxes" do we need for service applications, e.g., GateKeeper, NFS server, GUMS server (see Q 5), etc.?

	* How to get a certificate? Which certificate are we talking about, user/host/service? My understanding is that one should first get a user certificate. For this step, someone has to vouch for you. How will this work for a person who wants to start a new VO? Once one has a user certificate, they can be put on a site-admin list, and this allows them to apply for host/service certificates on their own authority.

	* How to set up condor? As I mentioned before, this took me a long time and I needed a lot of help. Even then, I haven't done it optimally. I did too many things manually.

	* What is recommended way for authenticating users? I am still using the old method of a local grid-map file, but many are using GUMS. The latter approach may require a separate machine to act as the GUMS server.

---++ From Iwona Sakrejda on 9/20/05

Now there are many areas that have to be covered. I look at it as a person responsible
for configuring and running a computing or staorage element.

The scenario I am most familiar with is that somebody from Atlas or STAR approaches me and says:
Join the OSG. So now what my questons would be? Let's say I got only 6 questions to ask
- got to share those 50.....

	* What a sys admin should do to deliver a resource to OSG (install, test, instructions are here...)

	* What mailing lists to join to say informed and follow developments (new releases of production software).

	* How to know what problems people "see" at my site.

	* Where to look for help  resolving problems.

	* How to handle users trashing my site (contacts, cleanup scripts....)


Already those 5 would make my life much easier......
