---+ October 19 Community Support Meeting
1:30pm Wednesday Central<br>
Phone Number 510-665-5437<br>
Meeting ID 2772

Attending: Vivek, Doug O., Anne, Iwona, Burt, Fred, !RobQ

---++ Knowledgebase
---+++ Top 8 Questions
The link: TopQuestionSuggestions

Numerous revisions were suggested.  Responsible parties were paying attention; here's a non-authoritative list from my notes:

   * Getting Started with OSG: need to check OSG policy for eligibility, requirements, approved CAs.  Will ask OSG-DOCS to review VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Formation documentation -- it is incomplete and will appear completely opaque to new proto-VOs.  Will note that people need to make some sort of contribution towards OSG (no free lunches).  Will link liberally to the Getting Started page as Anne suggested on the Questions page.
   * How to run jobs on OSG: will mention that many large VOs have their own custom job submission framework.  condor_g is the recommended way to submit jobs; Doug O. will send Vivek some toy script that he can link to as a job submit example.
   * Mailing lists: will prioritize lists (or give more minimal set), and link to main mailing list page.  Need to add OSG-SITES and change OSG-SECURITY to TG-SECURITY
   * How to add/delete/disable grid users: Anne H. will follow up with Lisa on progress
  
*Revisions should be in by Monday (24-Oct-2005) at noon.*

---++ OSG Community Communication
---+++ ChatRoom
The ChatRoomClientDocs are quite helpful, some clients that people have not yet got working are Adium (Mac), Proteus (Mac), Fire (Mac).  Iwona and Burt
will try to get them working; if we can't, we should specifically note that on the ChatRoom page.
---+++ Forums
STAR-BNL has offered to set up a !HyperNews installation for OSG.  Iwona will follow up.
