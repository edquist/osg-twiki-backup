---+++ Troubleshooting GRAM Job submission error codes

Some errors are listed here: http://www-fp.globus.org/about/faq/errors.html

Here are some of the most common (which are not necessarily listed at the globus link above)

<pre>
error  7 : you are not in the gridmap
			  (ask the site admin to check edg-mkgridmap or gums.config )

error 12 : Network (firewall or /etc/hosts.allow) or something similar
			  (ask the site admin to check firewall or
				/etc/hosts.{allow,deny})

error 17 : WARNING: Invalid log file: "/usr/local/grid/globus/tmp/gram_job_state/gram_condor_log.30742.1128017695"
			  GRAM Job failed because the job failed when the job manager attempted to run it (error code 17)

			  Possible solution 
				 (a) Make sure the sub-directory globus/tmp/gram_job_state/ exists
				 (b) Make sure that the sub-directory has the correct priviliges - should be drwxrwxrwt
					  If it is not, chmod 1777 globus/tmp/gram_job_state/

error 25 : account to which your DN is mapped exists, but home directory
			  does not exist ?
			  (ask the site admin to create home dir)

error 47 : account to which your DN is mapped does not exist
			  (ask the site admin if your vo is supported and add the
				account) 

			  OR: if doing a condor-g submit, something has become corrupted in
			  your local condor.  Try restarting condor locally.

error 129: After a job completes, Condor-G verfies that the sizes of stdout and
			  stderr it received matches the sizes that the jobmanager sent. This error
			  indicates that the sizes were different. The most likely cause is that
			  you're saving the output/error of multiple jobs to a single file, which
			  Condor-G doesn't support.

<pre>
voms-proxy-init --voms uscms:/uscms/Role=cmsuser
</pre>

---+++ To query !GridCat:

<pre>
wget http://gdsuf.phys.ufl.edu:8080/releases/gridcat/gridcat-client/bin/gcatc.py
gcatc.py --useservice=$URI/services.php --hostnames 
</pre>
Where =$URI= is

=http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu:8080/= for production <br>
or =http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/= for ITB

Also you can try <br>
http://home.fnal.gov/~burt/osg_gridcat.html for production, or 
<br>
http://home.fnal.gov/~burt/osg_gridcat_itb.html for ITB

To get environmental variables for a job, grid3-info.conf can be sourced (by bash).

It's in =$GLOBUS_LOCATION/../monitoring/grid3-info.conf=

---+++ To query !MonALISA:

ITB instance: http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html <br>
Production instance: http://grid02.uits.indiana.edu:8080/
