Goal for next week 11/18/06: have all the following q/a reviewed and ready to send to Mary H for inclusion in KB. Also, all the still-unready questions under the Dec 14 heading below.  Please add your text and your review comments directly to the twiki. Fred would like to show the KB at the January Gainesville OSG meeting.

Anne to check old email about outstanding problems with KB, check their status, and contact Mary (cc group) as needed.

Rob Q has about 15 docs in addition to Client Installation Guide to move to KB from Mambo. (Do these need review?) He'll send Client Inst guide to Tim, Tim will work with Mary to get it into KB.  May need 2 questions pointing to the answer: "client installation guide" and "how do I setup my desktop to run jobs". (Latter is under 12/14 heading.)

Tim to see about adding functionality to show whole list of questions in KB

Tim? to add link from OSG home page to KB home page (add text about "this is new/growing" or something. I don't think we want to say it's incomplete because by its nature, it always will be...)

Tim to add a feedback link to the KB pages (e.g. "Does this answer your question?") and link the mailto to osg-general.

Tim to write (under 12/14 section) "what to do if security event occurs"

Fred to review Burt's troubleshooting question, get the "setup Condor" answer reviewed by Alain Roy, and to ping Lisa about her "who's using my system" question.

KB is Google-searchable. (not discussed, or I missed it: Are we going to add a Google search button?)
