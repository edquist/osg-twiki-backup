---+++ Community Support Proposal

The current <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/docdb/osg_public/ShowDocument?docid=47">Open Science Grid Operations Model</a>
is focused on support issues involving large-scale Virtual Organizations (VOs), Resource Providers (RPs), and Service Providers
(SPs).  These organizations provide their own Support Centers to OSG and their users, and establish contractual obligations
to receive and provide support from other OSG Support Centers.

There will be numerous organizations which are too small to provide (and hence) receive support under this model.  There are resources which are unaffiliated with a single VO or affiliated with multiple VOs.  Routing all of these issues through a central
operations center is a possible solution, but it does not scale.  Additionally, during the integration and early deployment of OSG,
it is anticipated that the bulk of the support requests will center around installation and configuration issues.  

A proposed solution is the open-source model of community support.  The <a href="http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-general.html">OSG-GENERAL</a> mailing list
has been created to serve as the analog of the "users" mailing list for many open-source applications.  (The link for the list includes the registration method.) Members of the OSG community
are encouraged to help their fellow users get up and running (after all, if the resource in need of support is available for opportunistic
use, it's in everyone's best interest to get it on the Grid!)
The Support Centers will  make "best efforts" to monitor the list and resolve issues, but no guarantees
are made.  

---+++++ Examples

The <a href="http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-int.html">OSG-INT</a> mailing list is already serving as an ad-hoc support list for the integration testbed. This has worked well within the small community, and we've already seeing indications that unless something like the osg-general proposed is provided, people will come to OSG-INT with questions.  This would have a negative impact on future OSG development/releases and should be avoided.

Subject: [OSG-INT] How to get main ML site to recognize a CE

[ ... ]
[We] are working on the doc for the CE/VOMS/GUMS OSG installations and are trying to 
determine how we get our new site recognized by the OSG-ITB Monalisa repository?

Is this done through the discovery service or the registration process or ??

It's done automatically.. monalisa will recognize any daemon
that tries to contact it.

Hi

Any new site that runs MonALISA will appear on the repository and the
 map automatically  on the new version of the repository for OSG

This new version runs at :

	http://grid02.uits.indiana.edu:8080/

  and a development version at

http://pccil.cern.ch:8889/

If your site is XXX-Fnal ,  it appears on the map ,  but you must 
select the
world map , because you put wrong coordinates ( Latitude and Longitude )
in the ml configuration. It is on the map  close to the North pole

regards
