---+!!Community Support Proposal

%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%

---++ Introduction 

The current <a href="http://computing.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/docdb/osg_public/ShowDocument?docid=47">Open Science Grid Operations Model</a>
is focused on support issues involving large-scale Virtual Organizations (VOs), Resource Providers (RPs), and Service Providers
(SPs).  These organizations provide their own Support Centers to OSG and their users, and establish contractual obligations
to receive and provide support from other OSG Support Centers.

There will be numerous organizations which are too small to provide (and hence) receive support under this model.  There are resources which are unaffiliated with a single VO or affiliated with multiple VOs.  Routing all of these issues through a central
operations center is a possible solution, but it does not scale.  Additionally, during the integration and early deployment of OSG,
it is anticipated that the bulk of the support requests will center around installation and configuration issues.  

A proposed solution is the open-source model of community support.  The <a href="http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-general.html">OSG-GENERAL</a> mailing list
has been created to serve as the analog of the "users" mailing list for many open-source applications.  (The link for the list includes the registration method.) Members of the OSG community
are encouraged to help their fellow users get up and running (after all, if the resource in need of support is available for opportunistic
use, it's in everyone's best interest to get it on the Grid!)
The Support Centers will  make "best efforts" to monitor the list and resolve issues, but no guarantees
are made.  

%NAVY% Comments by Doug O.  I am very much in favor of developing some type of community support in OSG, but I think a mail list alone is just not enough.
Most open-source projects have quite a bit of structure
in how issues are handled though.  Several types of mail lists, bug tracking and some type of decision and prioritization process.  "Support by mail list" is really the same as how grid3 started and was quite painful to be subscribed to the list.  For people that are willing to spend some energy helping others by a mail list I think it will be more effective and easier if the questions and issues are tracked in a ticket system. %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Use Cases <small>(not all of these have happened in real life -- yet!)</small>
---+++ Use Case 1: Unaffiliated Compute Element appears in monitoring but not cataloging

A USCMS user noticed that an Academic Sinica Computing Center (ASCC) Compute Element running a deployment OSG release 
was being reported in !MonaLisa but not !GridCat.  This is in general an error condition, since !GridCat is the official OSG registry.

The route for problem reporting:

*USCMS User --> USCMS Support Center --> OSG Operations --> ASCC Administrator*

%NAVY% D.O. Doesn't this mean the USCMS Support Center opens a ticket in the OSG Ticket system and assigns it to ASCC? %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Use Case 2: Unaffiliated Compute Element sysadmin with installation issues

A sysadmin at an unaffiliated site is attempting to install an OSG release and failing.

*Sysadmin --> OSG-GENERAL mailing list*

The community responds on the mailing list and offers advice and support.

%NAVY% D.O. Does not this mean that contrary with the OSG Operations Model that the OSG software cache is a service without a Support Center responsible for its use? %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Use Case 3: Unaffiliated Compute Element sysadmin finds bug in VDT

A sysadmin at an unaffiliated site finds a bug in a VDT component.

*Sysadmin --> OSG-GENERAL mailing list %BLUE% --> %ENDCOLOR% VDT Support Center*

The VDT Support Center will make best efforts to monitor the OSG-GENERAL list and route issues appropriately, but
there is no guarantee of support.  The blue arrow may disappear due to support resources being consumed by other channels.

%NAVY% D.O. But VDT wants trouble reported direcctly to VDT and has a statement about interaction with OSG already so why ask them to monitor the OSG-GENERAL mail list?  The VDT are good guys and probably will do a good job of monitoring that list but why not encourage that Sysadmin to submit the question directly to VDT? %ENDCOLOR%


---+++ Use Case 4: Unaffiliated Compute Element sysadmin notes all USCMS jobs locally failing

*Sysadmin --> OSG-GENERAL mailing list %BLUE% --> %ENDCOLOR% USCMS Support Center*

This is virtually the same as case #3.

%NAVY% D.O. Yes, like 3. Why not encourage the Sysadmin to send notice directly to USCMS Support Center? %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Real World Examples

The <a href="http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-int.html">OSG-INT</a> mailing list is already serving as an ad-hoc support list for the integration testbed. This has worked well within the small community, and we've already seeing indications that unless something like the osg-general proposed is provided, people will come to OSG-INT with questions.  This would have a negative impact on future OSG development/releases and should be avoided.

%NAVY% D.O. I agree it depends upon the size of the community and for a small enough community a mail list works.  But for Grid3 the community was way too large for a mail list. %ENDCOLOR%

Subject: [OSG-INT] How to get main ML site to recognize a CE

[ ... ]
[We] are working on the doc for the CE/VOMS/GUMS OSG installations and are trying to 
determine how we get our new site recognized by the OSG-ITB Monalisa repository?

Is this done through the discovery service or the registration process or ??

It's done automatically.. monalisa will recognize any daemon
that tries to contact it.

Hi

Any new site that runs MonALISA will appear on the repository and the
 map automatically  on the new version of the repository for OSG

This new version runs at :

	http://grid02.uits.indiana.edu:8080/

  and a development version at

http://pccil.cern.ch:8889/

If your site is XXX-Fnal ,  it appears on the map ,  but you must 
select the
world map , because you put wrong coordinates ( Latitude and Longitude )
in the ml configuration. It is on the map  close to the North pole

regards
