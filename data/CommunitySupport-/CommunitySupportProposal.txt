---++ Introduction 

The current 
<a href="http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=47">Open Science Grid Operations Model</a>
is focused on support issues involving large-scale Virtual Organizations (VOs), Resource Providers (RPs), and Service Providers
(SPs).  These organizations provide their own Support Centers to OSG and their users, and establish contractual obligations
to receive and provide support from other OSG Support Centers.

There will be numerous organizations which are too small to provide (and hence) receive support under this model.  There are resources which are unaffiliated with a single VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo or affiliated with multiple VOs.  Routing all of these issues through a central
operations center is a possible solution, but it does not scale.  Additionally, during the integration and early deployment of OSG,
it is anticipated that the bulk of the support requests will center around installation and configuration issues.  

A proposed solution is the open-source model of community support.  The <a href="http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-general.html">OSG-GENERAL</a> mailing list
has been created to serve as the analog of the "users" mailing list for many open-source applications.  (The link for the list includes the registration method.) Members of the OSG community
are encouraged to help their fellow users get up and running (after all, if the resource in need of support is available for opportunistic
use, it's in everyone's best interest to get it on the Grid!)
The Support Centers will  make "best efforts" to monitor the list and resolve issues, but no guarantees
are made.  

%NAVY% Comments by Doug O.  I am very much in favor of developing some type of community support in OSG, but I think a mail list alone is just not enough.
Most open-source projects have quite a bit of structure
in how issues are handled though.  Several types of mail lists, bug tracking and some type of decision and prioritization process.  "Support by mail list" is really the same as how grid3 started and was quite painful to be subscribed to the list.  For people that are willing to spend some energy helping others by a mail list I think it will be more effective and easier if the questions and issues are tracked in a ticket system. %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Scaling Issues

Added -- Main.DougOlson - 21 Jun 2005

In any community, when the size and frequency of discussion grows beyond some modest size it is not viable to hold an unmoderated community discussion in a single room, be it a physical room with people talking, or a mailing list with people reading & writing.
Especially with this type of support structure that has experts joining occaisionally to provide assistance it is important to make the most efficient use of the expert's time and attention and if the noise level gets too large the sociological effect will be to drive the experts away.

Experience with Grid3 has shown that using mail lists as the only support infrastructure for 20 to 30 sites is noisy, painful and difficult for those periods with significant changes are occuring.  From this we can anticipate that during events, such as major software upgrades, that bring the whole OSG community together, there will be a need for additional support infrastructure in order to create queues, topics, rooms, etc. that will isolate individual discussion topics involving a few people into seperate spaces.  The section below on Suggested support infrastructure describes ways to achieve this.

---++ Use Cases <small>(not all of these have happened in real life -- yet!)</small>
---+++ Use Case 1: Unaffiliated/Multiaffiliated Compute Element appears in monitoring but not cataloging

A USCMS user noticed that an Academic Sinica Computing Center (ASCC) Compute Element running a deployment OSG release 
was being reported in !MonaLisa but not !GridCat.  This is in general an error condition, since !GridCat is the official OSG registry.

The route for problem reporting:

*USCMS User --> USCMS Support Center --> OSG Operations --> ASCC Administrator*

%NAVY% D.O. Doesn't this mean the USCMS Support Center opens a ticket in the OSG Ticket system and assigns it to ASCC? %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% B.H. Yes -- since ASCC does not have a Support Center, it would get cc:ed to the contact address for the resource, or failing that, directly to OSG-GENERAL. %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Use Case 2: Unaffiliated Compute Element sysadmin with installation issues

A sysadmin at an unaffiliated site is attempting to install an OSG release and failing.

*Sysadmin --> OSG-GENERAL mailing list*

The community responds on the mailing list and offers advice and support.

%NAVY% D.O. Does not this mean that contrary with the OSG Operations Model that the OSG software cache is a service without a Support Center responsible for its use? %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% B.H.  My understanding is that the cache itself does have a Support Center (the GOC).  If it were really a direct problem with the cache (servers down?) the GOC could pick this up off the mailing list and respond.  I think (hope?) most failures will be due to user misconfigurations on the user side, in which case it is certainly most efficient to get a response from the list.  See example 1 below.
%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Use Case 3: Unaffiliated Compute Element sysadmin finds bug in VDT

A sysadmin at an unaffiliated site finds a bug in a VDT component.

*Sysadmin --> OSG-GENERAL mailing list %BLUE% --> %ENDCOLOR% VDT Support Center*

The VDT Support Center will make best efforts to monitor the OSG-GENERAL list and route issues appropriately, but
there is no guarantee of support.  The blue arrow may disappear due to support resources being consumed by other channels.

%NAVY% D.O. But VDT wants trouble reported direcctly to VDT and has a statement about interaction with OSG already so why ask them to monitor the OSG-GENERAL mail list?  The VDT are good guys and probably will do a good job of monitoring that list but why not encourage that Sysadmin to submit the question directly to VDT? %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% B.H. I cannot speak for the VDT guys, but as USCMS Operations, I do not want to be contacted directly by unaffiliated sites.  The overhead for responding, tracking, and resolving problems simply will not scale.  We will make every effort to monitor problems through the OSG-GENERAL interface, but will not guarantee support -- while contacting us directly implies that guarantee. %ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Use Case 4: Unaffiliated Compute Element sysadmin notes all USCMS jobs locally failing

*Sysadmin --> OSG-GENERAL mailing list %BLUE% --> %ENDCOLOR% USCMS Support Center*

This is virtually the same as case #3.

%NAVY% D.O. Yes, like 3. Why not encourage the Sysadmin to send notice directly to USCMS Support Center? %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% B.H. See above. %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Real World Examples

The <a href="http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-int.html">OSG-INT</a> mailing list is already serving as an ad-hoc support list for the integration testbed. This has worked well within the small community, and we've already seeing indications that unless something like the osg-general proposed is provided, people will come to OSG-INT with questions.  This would have a negative impact on future OSG development/releases and should be avoided.

%NAVY% D.O. I agree it depends upon the size of the community and for a small enough community a mail list works.  But for Grid3 the community was way too large for a mail list. %ENDCOLOR%

%GREEN% B.H. The distributed operations should remove some of the load from the mailing list.  Additionally, the mode
of operation should also help -- for example, the USCMS Support Center will specifically be monitoring for issues specific
to USCMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and USCMS-affiliated resources.  Support staff will not be reading every e-mail that comes down the pipe. %ENDCOLOR%

[ ... ]
[We] are working on the doc for the CE/VOMS/GUMS OSG installations and are trying to 
determine how we get our new site recognized by the OSG-ITB Monalisa repository?

Is this done through the discovery service or the registration process or ??

It's done automatically.. monalisa will recognize any daemon
that tries to contact it.

Hi

Any new site that runs MonALISA will appear on the repository and the
 map automatically  on the new version of the repository for OSG

This new version runs at :

   http://grid02.uits.indiana.edu:8080/

  and a development version at

http://pccil.cern.ch:8889/

If your site is XXX-Fnal ,  it appears on the map ,  but you must 
select the
world map , because you put wrong coordinates ( Latitude and Longitude )
in the ml configuration. It is on the map  close to the North pole

regards

---++ Proposed Infrastructure

Added -- Main.DougOlson - 21 Jun 2005

The proposed infrastructure includes a mail list, an issue tracking system, a chat room server with persistent conversations and shared web space.  Each of these are open access to any member of the community to register with the service, create new issues, chat rooms and web pages & blogs. It should also allow for the possibility of moderation in case of unfortunate occurances.

---+++ Mail List

A mail list (already created as osg-general at opensciencegrid dot org) is open for subscription by anyone.  It is intended to be used for discussing technical issues related to OSG and anyone is able to post questions and answers to this list.  There are some experts who have volunteered to monitor and participate on this list, but without guarantees of responsiveness.  This service is hosted with the other OSG mail lists at FNAL.

---+++ Issue Tracking

An issue tracking system, which allows open registration, creation of new tickets and modification of tickets will provide a capability to track individual questions or requests in a more reliable way than a mail thread and also have notifications contrained to only those people that want to participate in the individual issue.  A Roundup (roundup.sourceforge.net) issue tracking system can provide such a service and integtrates both web and email interfaces.  It is simple enough and configurable enough (IMHO) to fits the needs of a volunteer community support model.   For the near term (~ 1 yr) this service can be hosted on ppdg.net where a trial example already exists.

---+++ Chat Rooms

A chat room server with persistent conversations provides a good alternative to email when one wants a truly interactive conversation and at the same time provides the historical logging feature that is so valuable in email.  A well known chat room can be monitored for questions. Particular topics for issues that need an isolated discussion can be created on the fly to help people focus on the single topic.  The Jabber chat room server run by the Distributed Systems Department at LBNL can be used to host these rooms (conference.dsd.lbl.gov).

---+++ Shared Web Space

Some of the information generated in and provided for a community support model needs to be more stable, well prepared and referenceable (a word?) than email, chat rooms or trouble tickets.  For this purpose a shared web space is the obvious infrastructure.  The TWiki provided by iVDGL to OSG is an obvious candidate for this service.  As web pages become even more useful and reliable they could be incorporated into the main part of the OSG documentation when appropriate.
