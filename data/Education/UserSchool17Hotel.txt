---+ Hotel Information

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [[http://parkhotelmadison.com/][Best Western Premier Park Hotel]], located on the Capitol Square near campus. They are located at:

<blockquote>
22 South Carroll Street<br>
Madison, WI 53703<br>
(608) 285-8000
</blockquote>

The hotel has a shuttle that may be available for transporting School participants, and it is located near many bus routes that serve the School location plus all of Madison.
 
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #F60;">We will reserve your room for you within the block, and we will pay for your basic room costs directly.</span> There is one participant per room, so you will not have a roommate.

*NOTE:* Even though we are paying for your hotel room, when you check in, you must provide the hotel with a credit card — it is only for optional expenses that you cause by yourself. We will pay for only the room charges and taxes.
