<h1>OSG System Administrator Visitors Program</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
Sites in the Open Science Grid have been providing production-quality service for a several years now, and therefore their site administrators are fully trained in the installation, maintenance, and operation of grid middleware and associated services. At the same time, the OSG Grid Operation Center (GOC) has been providing reliable central services and support.
 <b> Maybe some numbers, like the number of sites, number of jobs, data managed, etc. to impress ? Some reference to running experiments (LHC, Tevatron, LIGO..)? RobQ? </b>
<br><br>
Through this program, OSG offers the opportunity for foreign site administrators to spend some time at some OSG facilities, as well as the Grid Operation Center (GOC). Visitors will work for a period of time in a production environment and develop expertise on how to operate such facilities at their home institutions. This program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students working as site administrators at Grid sites for their National Grid Infrastructures. Students participating in this program will be able to return to their local institutions with valuable new skills ready to be used in their day to day activities. 
<br><br>
While visitors are at the hosting insitutions, their progress will be monitored by OSG staff to ensure the goals are being accomplished and the visitors are getting the expected training and orientation. 
<br><br>
OSG is an equal opportunity institution: all applicants will receive consideration without respect to race, religion, sex, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, national origin or physical disability. 
<br><br>
