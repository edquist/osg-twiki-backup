---++ Creating an OSG Connect Account

---+ OSG Connect Sign-up Instructions
In order to participate in the OSG Connect exercises on Thursday afternoon and Friday, you'll need to sign up for an OSG Connect account. Registrations are manually approved, so we would like you to sign up ahead of time. 

   *  *Step 1* Visit the OSG Connect sign up page at <a href="https://portal.osgconnect.net/SignUp" target="_blank">OSG Connect Sign Up Page</a>  click on the Continue button. This takes you to a page which will let you create a Globus ID or log in if you already have one. *IMPORTANT* Please use the same User ID you were assigned by ICTP for wireless access, we are expecting these to match during account activation. *ALSO IMPORTANT* It is not a good practice to use the same password, so please pick a different one. 
     
   *  *Step 2* After you have signed in or created a Globus ID, you will be asked to link an existing account or continue with the current Globus account. Click on the "No Thanks, continue" button to continue the application process.
     
   *  *Step 3* To complete your sign up, submit an application to join the "DataTrieste" project. It is important that you *choose your Globus ID in the username dropdown menu*. (If not sure, take a close look at  Figure.3  in the OSG Connect sign up page behind the AUP at https://osgconnect.net/signup.)
    
In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that acknowledges the receipt of your application.  

---++ Creating a Jetstream Cloud Account

No need to create an account. You will receive an training account and password on paper at the start of the Cloud session.
