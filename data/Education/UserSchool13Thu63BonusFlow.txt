---+ Thursday Exercise 6.3: Bonus Workflow Modifications

If you finish the entire workflow, and are thirsty for more you are welcome to try any of the following in whatever order you like:

---+++ Bonus 1
Rerun the workflow twice, once with the permutations batched such that each permutation job process takes ~20 minutes and another instance with permutation jobs of ~30 minutes (keeping a total of 25000 permutations). Of these variations, which finishes in an overall faster time? Why?

---+++ Bonus 2
You probably noticed that the job processes from the Permutation step create many log, out, and error files. Modify the Permutation submit files either to consolidate these files, or to place them in a subdirectory. You may wish to direct other files to this location as well.

---+++ Bonus 3
_Focusing just on the Permutation step_, scale up the number of total permutations to 250,000 per trait in two ways: once where each job process completes a number of permutations that correspond to run times of ~60 minutes, and once for runtimes of ~120 minutes. How does the throughput of the Permutation step differ between these two examples.

---+++ Bonus 4
Run the expanded Permutation steps for each trait (from Bonus 3) on the OSG. Because Joe’s submit files and your workflow are so portable, you should be able to copy everything to the course OSG submit node and run it from there. What difference does this make for the overall time it takes for a single trait’s Permutation step? 

---+++ Bonus 5
You probably noticed that Joe’s jobs bring back unnecessary files that are created when runR.pl sets the R environment at the beginning of each job. Use the HTCondor =transfer_output_files= to keep these files from coming back. Does this make much of a difference for the average time it takes for the Permutation processes to run?
