---+ Thursday Exercise 1.1: Getting Acquainted with OSG Connect
%TOC%

In this exercise, you'll get acquainted with the OSG Connect submit server (user-training.osgconnect.net), and the OSG Connect helpdesk.

---++ Get Acquainted with the OSG Connect Submit Server (user-training.osgconnect.net)

SSH to =username@user-training.osgconnect.net= in a command-line terminal.

---+++ Look around your 'home' directory

You'll notice the 'data', 'public', and 'stash' directories, which may be used in various specific OSG Connect guides. You'll use these spaces for different reasons. *Make sure to read the OSG Connect helpdesk guides* on [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000006512-guidelines-for-data-managment-in-osg-storage-and-transfer][data management]] and [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000002985-storage-solutions-on-osg-home-stash-and-public][storage solutions]].


---+++ Run =condor_status=

Running =condor_status= by itself on the OSG Connect submit host will give no output, but you can otherwise check with:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_status -pool osg-flock.grid.iu.edu</strong>
</pre>

---++ Visit the Helpdesk Materials

Visit the Help desk page (https://support.opensciencegrid.org/) and take a look at the knowledge base articles. You will be using some of these in the next exercises.

---+++ Move on to the next exercise when you're ready to submit jobs!
