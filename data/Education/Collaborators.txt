Education <BR>
   * Degree in Electronic Engineering, University of Granada, Spain. 1999. 
   * Degree in Physics, University of Granada, Spain. 2001. 
   * Master Thesis, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. 2006. (Dissertation: “Distributed Monte Carlo data production system in the LHC Computing Grid for the CMS experiment”)
   * Ph.D. in Physics, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain. 2007. (Dissertation: “Grid Computing for the CMS experiment” )<BR>
Current  Activities: <BR>
   * Advanced Applications Engineer: <br>
      * Development of extesions for PANDA (a job management system for OSG). PANDA is massively used to manage workflows for the ATLAS experiment. Currently I am improving some of its features, in particular the ones related security issues. As a pilot jobs based system, all operations are performed by an unique pilot identity, which involves several security risks. I have developed the code necessary to avoid such risks.  Also I am in charge of making this system more usable for others VOs in OSG. That includes providing data management capabilities, and technical assistance. 
   * Outreach and Education: 
      * Since Dec 2008 member of the Outreach and Education Group, for activities placed in South America.
