---+ Bonus: Installing Modules to your Python Installation

Most scientific software uses at least one specialized Python _module_ with special functionality for analysis.  In this exercise, you will pre-build a Python installation that includes the =numpy= module.  This exercise should take 10-15 minutes.  

---++ Build Job

As in [[UserSchool16Wed15pybuilt][Exercise 1.5]], we are going to submit an interactive job for building our installation.  You can choose to either add the module to your existing installation or start over from scratch.

   1. Log into =learn.chtc.wisc.edu=. 
   2. Find the =build.submit= file you used in [[UserSchool16Wed15pybuilt][Exercise 1.5]].  If you want to add the modules to your existing installation, transfer your pre-built Python \
file in =transfer_input_files=.  If you want to start over from scratch, leave the Python source in =transfer_input_files=. 
   3. Submit the build submit file using the =-i= option to =condor_submit=. 
   4. Once the job starts, either untar your pre-built Python installation from before, or build one from source.  
   5. Set your =PATH= to include your installation:  export PATH=$(pwd)/python/bin:$PATH

---++ Adding Modules

In this example, we will be installing the =numpy= module.  There are at least two ways to install Python modules - pick one of the two options below.  

---+++ Using =setup.py=

One way to install a Python module is to download the source from [[https://pypi.python.org/pypi][The Python Package Index]] and install it using the standard \
=setup.py= script.  

   1. Go to the Python Package Index and search for numpy.  Once you find the page for numpy, scroll down the list of downloads to find the source =tar.gz= file.  Save the link \
location and download it into the interactive job using =wget=.  
   2. Untar the numpy source, and move into the created directory.  Try running the given standard =setup.py= script using: python3 setup.py install
   3. It turns out we also need to install =setuptools=!  Move back in the main working directory of the job and repeat steps 1 and 2, but with the =setuptools= module.  
   4. Once =setuptools= is installed, move back into the =numpy-1.1.1= directory and try running the install command again: python3 setup.py install
   5. If all goes well, the installation process should complete.  Congratulations!  You've now included numpy in your installation.  

---+++ Using =pip=

=pip= is 
To install modules (in our case, numpy) using pip, simply run: 
pip3 install numpy

*Note:* If you are using your installation from before, this command will error out, because =pip= has stored the location of the directory where you originally built python.  To fix \
this...

---++ Using Your Installation

   1. Once you have installed your modules using either method, create a tarball of your new installation.  You just need to re-tar your =python= installation directory \
as the modules have been installed to a sub-directory inside.  \
<pre class="screen">
$ <strong>tar czf python_np.tar.gz python/</strong>
</pre> \
   1. Exit the interactive job.  Your new installation, =python_np.tar.gz= should have returned to the submit server with you.  
   1. Download and untar a test =.py= script and input file =inflammation.csv=.  
   1. Make a copy of a script and submit file from the previous exercises, modifying them to use your =python_np.tar.gz= file as the pre-built installation and to run the \
script you just downloaded.  Note that the script reads in the inflammation file, so you need to include it in =transfer_input_files=!
   1. Submit your job. Does it work?
