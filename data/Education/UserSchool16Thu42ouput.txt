---+ Thursday Exercise 4.2: Large Output Data

In this exercise, we will run a job that... This exercise should take 20-25 minutes.

---++ Background

This exercise will be the reverse of the previous exercise!  Instead of large input/small output, we have a small \
input file that becomes a large output file.  


---++ Submit File

   1. Create a submit file for this job, based on other submit files from the school.  
   1. Important considerations: 
      1. Memory, disk
      1. Important!  Don't list the name of the PDF in =transfer_input_files=.  Our job will be interacting with the input \
PDF files solely from within the job's executable.  
   1. Add a line to the file that ensures your job will land on computers that have access to Gluster: 
<pre class="file">
requirements = (Target.HasGluster == true)
</pre>

---++ Script

This is the most important piece of our job submission!  This is how our job will interact with the files in Gluster.  

   1. Create a file called =run_ocr.sh=
   1. This file needs to do the following: 
      - copy our input file from Gluster
      - run the OCR program
      - then, most importantly, it needs to remove the input file when the job completes

Once your script is complete, submit the job.  

---++ Follow-Up Challenge

We wrote the name of the PDF file into our =run_ocr.sh= executable script.  How can you change: 
   1. the script
   2. the submit file
To submit a job for each of the PDF files in our Gluster directory?
