---++ Rachana Ananthakrishnan
Rachana Ananthakrishnan is a Senior Software Developer at Argonne National Laboratory working on design and development of the Globus Toolkit(GT). She developed the current authorization engine in the Java Globus Tookit 4.0 Core, as well as many of the available plug-ins, and is now leading all Java Globus Tookit security development work. She also worked on the GT3 security infrastructure, developed the Community Authorization Service (CAS), and the GT4 Delegation Service.

Rachana started working in the area of distributed computing as a Research Assistant at the Extreme Computing Lab at Indiana University, where she completed her Masters in Computer Science.


---++ Robert Grossman
Dr. Robert Grossman is the Director of the Laboratory for Advanced Computing (LAC) and the National Center for Data Mining (NCDM) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The Lab and Center perform research, sponsor standards, manage an international data mining testbed, and engage in outreach activities in the areas of data mining and data intensive computing.
---++ Todd Tannenbaum
Todd Tannenbaum is the 
Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin - Madison.

---++  Bill Allcock
Bill Allcock is a Software Engineer with the Distributed Systems Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory. He is the technology coordinator and evangelist for !GridFTP within the Globus Alliance. In his 15 years work experience he has been involved in a wide array of areas including Grid / distributed computing, computer networking, embedded systems, data acquisition, process engineering, control system tuning, and colloidal chemistry. Bill's current research focus involves applications requiring managed access to large (Terabyte and Petabyte sized) data sets, so called DataGrid problems. He is also heavily involved in the Global Grid Forum (a Grid computing standards organization).

Dr. Grossman became a faculty member at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1988 and is currently Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and Professor of Computer Science. From 1984-1988 he was a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1985 and a B.A. from Harvard in 1980. He currently holds a part time appointment at UIC.

Robert Grossman is also the Founder and Managing Partner of Open Data Partners LLC, which provides strategic, consulting, and data services so that businesses can use their data more effectively. 


---++ Borja Sotomayor
Borja Sotomayor is a <nop>PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. His research, under the supervision of Dr.Kate Keahey at Argonne National Lab, lies in the intersection of Grid
Computing and virtualization. In particular, his work focuses on resource management for virtual workspaces, an abstraction for execution environments that can be dynamically deployed on a grid.

Borja has also worked on several Globus documentation efforts, such as "[[http://gdp.globus.org/gt4-tutorial][The GT4 Programmer's Tutorial]]" and the book <cite>Globus Toolkit 4: Programming Java Services</cite>, co-written with Lisa Childers. Borja was previously a junior faculty member at the University of Deusto (Bilbao, Spain).
