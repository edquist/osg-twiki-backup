---+ 2013 OSG User School

<strong><font size="+1">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</font></strong>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, June 24–27, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool13Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in computer science or other sciences where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process. We will open the application process starting on *March 4, 2013*. Check this website over the next couple weeks for more information. This is a great opportunity!

---++ Spread the Word

Please spread information about the school to people you know who may be interested. We will be sending many announcement emails in early March 2013, but if you know a good candidate, just send them to this website!

Another way to help: [[%ATTACHURL%/2012OsgUserSchool.pdf Download our flyer]], print copies, and post in prominent locations where good candidates might see it!
