---+ OSG User School 2015

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, 27–31 July, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool15Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff. Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School.

---++ Applications

Applications closed on 5 May 2015. We plan to notify applicants of our decisions by mid-May. Thanks for your interest!

If you applied and do not have a letter of recommendation submitted yet, please have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to user-school@opensciencegrid.org (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best). For the letter, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG User School 2015” in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.
