---+ 2012 OSG User School Logistics

This page contains a great deal of reference information about attending the School. Please read it carefully! If you have any questions, email us at:

   gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org

Use that address for *all* emails about the organization of the School.

*Note:* Logistics for the XSEDE12 Conference are handled separately by the XSEDE12 program committee. They will contact you by email to arrange travel to Chicago.

---++ Schedule

For travel planning:

   * *Arrive on Sunday, June 24, 2012,* prior to 5 p.m. (if possible). Although classes begin on Monday morning, there is a welcome dinner on Sunday evening for students and instructors. This is a nice way to get to know each other and start the week.

   * *Depart on Friday, June 29, 2012,* any time. The School finishes with another dinner on Thursday evening, so it is best to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the five nights of this schedule.

The detailed class schedule will be posted soon.

---++ Travel To and From Madison

Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, email us with your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---+++ We Offered to Pay for Your Travel

Our travel budget is *very limited* this year. We budgeted an average of $450 per student for travel to and from Madison, and there are no extra travel funds. If you can travel for less than $450, that is awesome! If not, contact us immediately, and we will work together to find a good option.

Note that airfares have increased sharply since we made the budget. Please search for the most cost-effective (yet reasonable) means to get to Madison. Here are a few ideas:

   * Instead of flying, consider driving or taking a bus or train; we can support *all* kinds of travel
   * If you must fly, look aggressively for low airfares and any special deals
   * Consider flying into Milwaukee (1.5 hours away) or Chicago (2.5 hours away) and taking a bus to/from Madison
   * Even though we offered to pay for your travel, if there is any way you can get travel funding, please do so and let us know right away!

See below for details about each travel mode:

---++++ Travel by Airplane

Please do NOT buy your own airline tickets! Cathy Richard (in our department), will buy the tickets for you.

To arrange flights to/from Madison:

   1. <p><strong>Gather personal information:</strong></p>
      * Your name, to put on ticket (should match your official ID)
      * Email address you check regularly (should match the one we have)
      * Phone number
      * Your birthdate
   1. <p><strong>Choose your preferred itineraries:</strong></p><p>There are lots of websites for finding flights ([[http://www.hipmunk.com Hipmunk]], [[http://www.kayak.com Kayak]], [[http://www.expedia.com Expedia]], individual airlines, etc.) — use them to look for (*but not purchase*) flight options. Pick 1–3 options that work for you and, ideally, cost less than $450. For each flight segment, note the date, airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, and departure and arrival airports. If you like, use standard abbreviations (Madison is “MSN” = Dane County Regional Airport):</p><pre class="screen">24 Jun (Sun), United 1122, depart 7:16am BWI, arrive  8:18am ORD
24 Jun (Sun), United 5981, depart 9:45am ORD, arrive 10:35am MSN
...</pre><p>If you send us more than one itinerary, list complete round-trip sets of flight segments, and clearly rank your choices.</p>
   1. <p><strong>Email your choices:</strong></p><p>Email to [[mailto:cathy@cs.wisc.edu Cathy Richard]] and CC [[mailto:gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org]]. Include your personal information and preferred itineraries. If Cathy has questions, she will contact you directly. When your flight arrangements are complete, she will send you the final details, including the confirmation and ticket numbers.

---++++ Bus or Train (or Both)

Typically, reasonable bus and train options — i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison — cost much less than air options.

If you are buying bus or train tickets ahead of time, we *may* be able to buy them for you. Otherwise, you can purchase the ticket(s) yourself and then request reimbursement. To have us purchase tickets for you, follow the instructions for Travel by Airplane, above; that is, gather personal information, choose some itineraries, and email us (Cathy and the list) your choices. If Cathy cannot purchase the tickets, she will let you know.

If you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email), which should include:

   * Complete itinerary
   * Your name
   * Total amount paid

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison
   * Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)

---++++ Personal Car

If you are driving to Madison, we will reimburse you the standard government rate for mileage (as calculated by Google Maps) and tolls. Also, we may be able to reimburse you for parking costs in Madison. Keep your receipts for tolls and parking (in Madison)!

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Estimated round-trip mileage

---+++ You Are Paying for Your Travel

If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday and depart on Friday (or else check with us first about the hotel).

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)

---++ Hotel

We have reserved a block of rooms at the [[http://www.union.wisc.edu/wuhotel.htm Wisconsin Union Hotel]], located in the brand-new Union South building just across from where the classes will be held. This is a very nice facility and is extremely convenient for all School activities.

---+++ If We Offered to Pay for Your Hotel Room

All you need to do is tell us your travel plans (arrival and departure dates and times), and we will reserve your room and pay for basic room costs. One student per room.

*NOTE:* Even if we are paying for your hotel room, when you check in, you must provide the hotel with a credit card — it is only for optional expenses that you incur yourself.

---+++ If You Are Paying for Your Hotel Room

You may stay anywhere you like, although we suggest that you let us reserve one of the Wisconsin Union Hotel rooms for you. It is convenient and the rates are very competitive for this part of Madison. Nearly all School events will be held in the Union or next door in the Computer Sciences building. It is your choice, but if you decide to stay at the Union, you must let us know your travel plans (arrival and departure dates and times) so that we can reserve the room.

No matter where you stay, please tell us where it is, so that we know how to contact you locally.
