---++ Finding a Block of Hotel Rooms

   * *Timing.* Reserve a block of hotel rooms as early as possible to get good availability and state rates (see below). Typically, selecting dates and finding a hotel go hand-in-hand. Try to find a single hotel with enough rooms, and be sure to set the check-in for the Sunday before the School begins and check-out for the day after (e.g., if the School is June 24&ndash;28, participants check in on June 23 and check out on June 29). Check the following hotels (at least):
      * [[https://union.wisc.edu/visit/stay-at-the-union/][Union South]] (used in 2012)
      * [[https://fluno.com/about-guest-rooms.php][Fluno Center]] (used partially in 2015)
      * [[http://conferencing.uwex.edu/lodging.cfm][Lowell Center]] (used in 2011)
      * [[http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-madison-MSNDTDT/][DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Madison]] (used in 2010, 2013–2014, partially in 2015)
      * [[http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/wisconsin/hampton-inn-and-suites-madison-downtown-MSNBJHX/][Hampton Inn & Suites Madison / Downtown]]
      * [[http://parkhotelmadison.com/][Best Western Premier Park Hotel]] (used in 2016 & 2017)

   * *State rates.* Because funding for the School comes from a federal grant, we must try to get state rates for lodging (and meals, see below). *The 2017 state rate for hotels is $115 per night per person without taxes.* If we are paying the bill directly, there should be no taxes. Most of the hotels in the area have state rate rooms available, but it can be difficult finding all the rooms at one place.
      * Where/how to find the state rate: http://www.bussvc.wisc.edu/acct/policy/travel/lodging.html (links to travel pages); https://uw.foxworldtravel.com/ (may be listed as a post on the home page); https://uw.foxworldtravel.com/rate-calculator/ (calculate it yourself); http://www.bussvc.wisc.edu/acct/teweb/travel/domesticLodgingMax.html (current up to 2015)

   * Make sure the hotel knows that the University of Wisconsin will pay for most rooms in the block directly, although some participants will pay for themselves (and thus incur taxes).

   * Remember to ask about and account for parking&nbsp;&mdash; pricing, availability, etc.

   * If a block of rooms will cost more than $5,000 (which it will these days), the College of Letters & Sciences makes us do certain bureaucratic things *when we first receive the contract*:
      1. Talk to departmental administrative staff to double-check the procedure
      1. Send the unsigned contract to Purchasing Services (2014&ndash;2016: Sarah Martin <sarah.martin@wisc.edu>, 2017: Doreen Forslund <doreen.forslund@wisc.edu>) and ask for contract amendments and signature
         1. Be sure to include the list of other hotels contacted and their availability/rates for comparison ("bids")
      1. Send the UW-signed contract back to the hotel for countersignature and ask for a fully endorsed copy back
      1. Work with Computer Sciences administrative staff (2016: Sarah Baldridge <sarahb@cs.wisc.edu>) to create and have approved a Purchase Order for the maximum possible amount (_x_ rooms &times; _y_ days &times; _z_ rate). Provide a funding string, if possible.

<pre class="screen">
---++ Applications

Applications are now open. The *deadline for applications is Friday, 14 April 2017,* end of the day. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

   * Complete the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/osgus-2017/][online application form]] (link correctly goes to vdt.cs.wisc.edu website)
   * Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to [[mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org user-school@opensciencegrid.org]]<br/>(any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG User School 2017” in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

   * Be graduate students (but see below)
   * Need for large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery
   * Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)
   * Be available to travel to Madison in late July (foreign students: check your passport and visa now!)

*Not a graduate student?* We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework; make a strong case for yourself! Also, we consider other groups (post-doctoral students, faculty, researchers, staff, etc.), especially if you convince us that this opportunity is likely to have a significant effect on your work or research.

---++ Spread the Word

Please tell people who may be interested in the School about us. We will send email announcements in early-March 2017, but you can send anyone to this website at any time!

Another way to help: [[%ATTACHURL%/osg-user-school-2017-flyer.pdf Download our flyer]], print copies, and post in prominent locations where good candidates might see it!

---++ During Applications

---+++ Marketing

   * OSG User School Facebook and Twitter
      * Before applications open, check the Facebook and Twitter profiles for needed updates (update for the current school/year).
      * Post to Facebook and Twitter when applications open and continue doing so periodically during the application period. Aim for ~3 Tweets per week and ~2 Facebook posts per week during the application period.
      * Post daily reminders for the 3-5 days leading up to the application close date.
      * Post updates periodically before, during, and just after the school. 
      * It is ok to copy or post similar things as the year before. 
      * Remember to add OSG/school images to most of the posts. 
      * Mentioning or linking to recent OSG news from [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/]] is encouraged. 
      * Pre-write and schedule announcements where possible using [[https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/][Tweet Deck]] and the Scheduled Posts section on Facebook. Encourage others to review and edit tweets and posts before they are published.


---++++ Announcement Email Template
Here is the basic School Announcement email text (pre-wrapped at 72 columns, please send as plain text!) – click here to open the Google Doc for 2017: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VSPuEHBpSrunYYjCAYMIECsHXaBDSMyyOncpl84b84Q/edit][OSG User School 2017 - Primary Marketing Email]].

When sending the announcement, we generally include a preface that is specific and directed to the audience. At least:

---+++ Applicant Reminders for Letters of Recommendation

During the final week before applications close, contact every applicant without a letter of recommendation on file. (Conversely, if a letter of recommendation has been received for a student without an application, ask the recommender to check with the student regarding their application.) A sample email to applicants is below.

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG School - letter of recommendation needed soon</pre>
     <pre class="file">{APPLICANT}:

Thank you again for your interest in the OSG User School 2017! We look forward to reviewing your applications materials very soon.

At this time, we have received no letter for you. If you believe that one was sent already, please reply and let us know. Otherwise, this would be a great time to remind your recommender about the deadline on Friday (14 April) for application materials.

Thanks again, and we hope to hear from you soon.

If any applications or letters of recommendation have not been received by the deadline, and there is still time for materials to be submitted before applications are reviewed, send one last reminder. Rows in the application spreadsheet can be highlighted in light red to more easily track incomplete submissions.

---+++ Other Preparations

   * Prepare Travel, Hotel, and Personal Info (visa) pages on TWiki (but do not link)
   * Have the content of the TWikis reviewed by CS Travel to make sure it is complete and up-to-date. (Personal Info and Travel pages)
   * Have the content of the Qualtrics Travel Survey reviewed by CS Travel to make sure it's complete and up-to-date. Keep in mind students with various visa types, US citizens/permanent residents, local/UW-Madison people, and people paying their own way. Delete test data from Qualtrics before sending survey link.
   * Set up or update a travel profile with Fox Travel. 
      * Website: https://www.cvent.com/events/SMMForm/MeetingRequest/MeetingMain.aspx?smm_form_stub=7ffbe9a2-853c-4c8c-ad13-33e51e2a5872

---++ To Close Applications

   1. Add application-closed message to Education home page
   1. Rename application form to =index-open.html= and install new =index.html= with closed message

---++ Processing Applications

In a nutshell, the main School organizers (currently Tim and Lauren) make all acceptance decisions and record them in the application spreadsheet; then the administrative folks use the decision information to notify all applicants and record acceptances in the master spreadsheet.

If more than one person is sending notifications, obviously some coordination is needed! Probably the easiest way to divide the work is by notification template – that is, one person can take all of the “a-standard” emails, etc.

The team should also meet to discuss what additional information is needed from applicants who accept the invitation to attend the OSG User School. Create a working document (See OSG User School 2016 survey ideas) from which to generate a Qualtrics survey (See 2016 OSG User School Participant Information). Also, set a deadline for survey responses so there will be enough time to coordinate travel. Be sure that everyone in the group has all/administrative permissions to the survey.

---+++ To notify an applicant of a decision

   1. Pick an applicant to notify, avoiding conflicts with other people doing the same task
   1. Note the name of the notification template in the application spreadsheet (currently, the “Cat” column)
   1. Find and open the corresponding notification template in the Google Drive. You may need to make a copy and update the text from the previous year.
   1. Copy the notification text to a *plain text* email (i.e., drop all formatting from Google)
   1. Check the text for placeholders (currently like ={{THIS}}=) and fill them in based on the application spreadsheet
   1. Use the generic signature in the template, or replace it with your own (as long as all School contact information is present)
   1. Address the email to the applicant and set the CC: and Reply-To: fields to the administrative mailing list (currently =user-school@opensciencegrid.org=)
   1. Send!
   1. When the email arrives back from the mailing list, note the date in the applicant spreadsheet (Notified column)

---+++ To handle an accepted offer to attend

When an invited student writes back to accept our offer to attend:

   1. In the application spreadsheet, note their reply (YES/NO) in the Reply column
   1. Copy the participant’s application information (for 2016, columns C through U; for 2017, columns C through T and AK)
   1. Switch to the master spreadsheet
   1. Paste the participant information into the next available empty row
   1. Double-check that the pasted information lines up correctly with the column headings; if not, undo and try again
   1. Back in the application spreadsheet, put an “X” in the rightmost column (“Master?”) for the applicant, to indicate that their information has been copied
   1. Reply with a brief, cheery email! Also, include any additional questions or a link to a survey to obtain necessary information. See the Template Accepted Participant Survey in the Google Drive.
   1. Indicate when a participant responds to the survey in the Master spreadsheet. (Put an "X" in the "Info?" column T.)

---+++ Reminders

   1. Remind invited students to respond to their invitation emails so we know if they have accepted to attend the School.
   1. Remind the students who have accepted to fill out the survey.
   1. Review survey responses and clarify any questions with the students (visas, conflicting information, incomplete information, etc.).
   1. For anyone with a J-1 visa, follow the directions in this Google Doc: <link>https://docs.google.com/a/wisc.edu/document/d/17Kwplicx5mwfFpsut1P-N-L7sLeeBlMXpj2ZJPSyz8Q/edit?usp=sharing</link>

---++ Arranging Travel and Hotel

This section is out of date (from 2016) and Tim needs to update it, as we moved to using Fox World Travel for booking travel arrangements in 2017.

   * Tim will create a Travel spreadsheet containing information from the Master spreadsheet and survey responses
   * Project Assistants will send all students who replied to the survey an opening email with links to logistics pages (See Template - 3 - Starting Travel on the Google Drive)
      * GROUP 1 - DRIVING FROM NEARBY
     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG User School 2017 travel information</pre>
     <pre class="file">Once again, welcome to the OSG User School!

The next step in the OSG User School process is to plan your travel to and from Madison, then let us know about your plans. This email and the links below give you all of the information that you will need to arrange your travel, so please read carefully.

TRAVEL

Based on your location, it seems likely that you will be driving or taking a bus to get to the School and back. For more information about ground transportation options, please follow the link below and read the “Travel by Bus” and “Travel by Personal Car” sections carefully. (Ignore the comments about limits on driving — that is for people who want to drive halfway across the country to get here.)

https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17Travel

Once you decide on travel plans, please email us! At very least, we need to know how you are getting here and back, and your planned arrival and departure dates and approximate times.

SCHEDULE

Please try to arrive in Madison on Sunday, July 16, before about 6 p.m.; there will be a welcome dinner for the School that evening, and we really want you to be there! Classes begin Monday morning and run Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to about 5 p.m. Then on Friday evening, there will be a closing dinner and we would love to have you there as well. So consider leaving later on Friday evening, or feel free to stay Friday night and leave on Saturday — we will cover your hotel cost for Friday night.

NON-RESIDENT ALIENS

If you are not a United States citizen or permanent resident, please visit the following page and check the documentation requirements carefully. With the information forms that you completed, we should have all necessary information for now, but it is good to review the documents that you must bring to the School itself.

https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17PersonalInfo

For all other logistics information regarding the School, please visit:

https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17Logistics

      * GROUP 3 - WE DO NOT PAY TRAVEL
     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Travel for the OSG User School 2017</pre>
     <pre class="file">{APPLICANT}:

Hello again from the OSG User School! By now, you probably have made travel plans for the School or are about to do so. We would like some information about your travel arrangements to help us plan other aspects of the School. Once you have made your plans, please let us know!

If you are flying, we would like the following information for your flight segments into and out of Madison:

* Arrival or departure time
* Carrier (i.e., airline)
* Flight number
* Connecting airport

We use this information to track delays on arrival and to help arrange for free shuttle service between the Madison airport and campus. If you do not mind and it is easier for you, just send us your complete itinerary.

If you are driving or arriving in Madison in some other way, we would still like reasonably accurate information about how and when you are arriving and departing.

Also, we should start thinking about hotels. We have a block of rooms at the Best Western Premier Park Hotel (formerly Best Western Plus Inn on the Park) on the capitol square in Madison, near campus. Rooms are $115 per night, and with Madison taxes that is $1xx.xx per night. We would be happy to add you to the block of rooms, in which case you need take no further action OTHER THAN telling us that you want to stay there. Of course, you are free to make your own hotel arrangements, in which case we would at least like to know where you are staying in case we need to contact you there.

Thank you in advance for your help, and if you have any questions or concerns please contact us at user-school@opensciencegrid.org.

   * PAs receive travel information and log in Travel Spreadsheet
   * When travel is booked, add the itinerary to the Master spreadsheet along with additional costs (e.g. flights to/from O'Hare will also have a bus from O'Hare to Madison, drivers will need hotel parking)
   * PAs handle most questions about travel, hotel, etc.
   * Tim handles hard questions
      * In general, follow the UW/hotel policy when it comes to special travel requests (traveling with spouse/family, alternate arrival/departure dates, alternate arrival/departure locations, etc.). 
         * Find the baseline price. Find reasonably priced flight to Madison or a nearby airport on the school's preferred travel dates within the budget. Save the flight/cost from Concur/Fox Travel to a PDF. Any alternate travel arrangements cannot exceed this baseline cost.
         * The hotel will have a different rate based on occupancy. The student must pay for the room directly, and we will reimburse them up to the state rate with tax for 1 person.
         * Confirm that the student is comfortable with paying on their own and being reimbursed after the school before proceeding.
   * Room blocks can be made at the DoubleTree, Fluno Center, or Best Western at the state rate. 
         * After all travel arrangements are booked by CS, send the rooming list to the hotel, noting special check in/out dates and parking for those driving.
         * You may also need to make additional hotel reservations outside of the room block (may have a different nightly rate) for the ACI-REFs and others.
         * Once the rooming list is finalized, send out an email with the hotel confirmation numbers to everyone with a reservation. Pay close attention to check-in/out dates and be sure to note if there is a different room rate (paying on their own), parking, late arrival times, and multiple guests per room.

---++ Curriculum

   * Tim: Draft list of invited Showcase speakers
   * Tim, Lauren, Christina: Create the detailed daily schedule and update the website <literal>[[UserSchool%RED%YY%ENDCOLOR%DetailedSchedule][Detailed Schedule]]</literal>
   * PAs: Invite speakers and confirm until slots are filled
   * PAs: Confirm again about two weeks out
   * PAs: Ask about technology needs: computer, projection, microphone, etc.


---++ Room Reservations
   * Tim: Reserve CS room 1240 (7:45am-5:45pm daily). Confirm availability of microphones, projector, computers, etc. Create a ticket and follow up with lab@cs.wisc.edu, if needed.
   * PAs: Reserve a conference room (no AV, just the room) for ~20 people (herringbone setup) at Union South for the Evening Work Sessions on Monday-Thursday from 7pm to 9pm. <events@union.wisc.edu>
      * Today In The Union (TITU) will list the meeting room location: [[http://union.ems.wisc.edu/VirtualEMS/CustomBrowseEvents.aspx?data=MeN0rP%2FRPNoJS2WjBImM5NV%2B64hv0ZxW]].
      * Add the room information to the [[Education/UserSchool17Evenings][Evening Work Sessions]]
      * A map of Union South: [[https://apps.union.wisc.edu/materials/Visit_BuildingMap_US.pdf]]
   * PAs: Contact Laura Legault <legault@cs.wisc.edu> to formally reserve the CS Learning Center (fka Unit III common area or the seating space above the main CS entrance facing Union South) for the entire week and request enough plastic tablecloths to cover all of the tables during breakfast and lunch.
      * Print off wall and table signs to put up in the CS Learning Center/Unit III area that week.
      * 8-9 picnic table-sized plastic tablecloths can cover all of the tables. To make it work, push 2 tables together or cut tablecloths in half. (As of July 2016, there are 9 small square cocktail tables, 2 small round cocktail tables, 1 small square table, and 2 large square tables).
      * Set up the signs and tablecloths in CS Learning Center/Unit III early on Monday morning or the Friday/weekend before the school starts (breakfast is at 8am). Signs and tablecloths can be left up all week, but should be checked each morning.


---++ Other Tasks

   * *Instructors* Select, invite, and arrange travel for instructors, including HTC Showcase ones. Generally, this task occurs after the high-level curriculum has been designed and before it gets too late for (a) travel arrangements, and (b) content development. It is probably a good idea to make initial contact with key instructors about 3 months out, and aim to settle the core instructor list at 6–8 weeks out. Much later than that, and instructors will be hard to schedule, travel will be expensive, and content development will be rushed. For each remote instructor, offer to arrange and pay for travel (airfare, rental car, mileage, parking) and hotel. Invite all instructors to participate in as much of the schedule as they like, especially the social events. Active remote collaborators may have other activities that they can perform locally, so they may easily fill the whole week with events, School and otherwise. Be sure to contact HTC Showcase invitees early, to get on their schedules; assuming the School is during the academic summertime, it would not hurt to make initial inquiries before the spring semester is out.
      * Email all of the showcase presenters on Thursday morning to remind them about their presentations on Friday. Send individual emails to each presenter with their presentation time and a reminder to let us know if they are not bringing a VGA-compatible laptop.

   * *Ground Transportation* Most students will arrive at the airport and will need transportation to the School hotel (or other venue, depending on timing). Look for groups of students (or instructors flying in) arriving on the same flight or on closely spaced arrivals (sort Master spreadsheet, propose shuttle/taxi schedule, and run it by Tim), and help them meet each other and share transportation. (Introduce everyone who will be in that shuttle/taxi group via email beforehand. Assign one person as the leader to call the shuttle/cab, and give them a sign to print off to hold up at the airport.) If using taxis (e.g. Fluno Center), see if any groups are large enough to warrant a minivan, shuttle bus, or other special vehicle. Make backup plans for when flights arrival early or late, and be sure that students have a clear means of communicating transportation changes _en route_. (Email students to tell them to contact Fox World Travel if there are travel issues coming to Madison. We should see any itinerary changes come to the list. Students can email the list if they will be late for the dinner.) Also send an email to Katie at the DoubleTree (or David at the Best Western) with the proposed shuttle schedule, making changes as needed (and update the students) based on the shuttle availability or updated pick-up times.

      * *Sample Shuttle Email to Hotel*
     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG User School - Hotel Shuttle Schedule on Sun. 7/16</pre>
     <pre class="file">Hi David,
 
For the OSG User School next week, many of the guests in our room block will be flying into the Madison airport on Sunday, 7/16. Would it be possible to arrange a schedule for your hotel shuttle to pick them up? Please let me know if your shuttle has any limitations, such as hours of operation, times where it has already been booked, maximum number of passengers, minimum roundtrip time to/from the airport, etc. (I will also instruct our students to call the hotel when they land to have the shuttle dispatched. Is the number still 608-285-8000?)
 
Below is a list of the guests and their flight arrival times.
9:34am: 1 person (Chenlu)
1:00-1:18pm: 3 people (Joe B, Alex Y, Usman)
2:54pm: 3 people (Daniela, Olabisi, Tyler)
3:23pm: 5 people (Ashley, Diana, Forrest, Hei-man, Yijun)
3:41pm: 9 people (Anthony, Carlo Matt, John Gregory, Julius, Matthew, Hossein, Natalia, Nishath Rajiv, Paul)
4:50pm: 5 people (Ariella, Carrie, Nick, Vera, Derek)
 
If this works well, I will also work with you to schedule shuttles for our guests leaving from the Madison airport on Saturday, 7/22.
 
Thanks for your help, and let me know if there are any problems with this proposed schedule,

{For DoubleTree/Best Western:} I wanted to give you information on finding a taxi to take to your hotel at the DoubleTree/Best Western. (Note that the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel stops running at 10:30pm, after your scheduled arrival time.)

{Person1}: I would like you to be the group organizer, if that’s OK with you. When you arrive in Madison, please meet up with {Person2}. Then, follow the signs for Ground Transportation. Taxis can be found at the north end of the airport, past the baggage claim area, at Door #7.

{Remember to save the receipt for reimbursement.}

Attached is a simple “OSG” sign that you can print and use to help find {Person2}. The Madison airport is small but big enough to lose people in. Perhaps it is best to agree to meet at the arrival gate, or at the security exit — I will leave the details to you.

Let me know if I can be of any further assistance in helping you get from the airport to the hotel!

The DoubleTree hotel/Best Western Premier Park Hotel offers a free shuttle from the Madison airport to the hotel, so I wanted to help you all find each other and take the shuttle together.

{Person1}: I would like you to be the group organizer, if that’s OK with you. When you arrive in Madison, please assemble the whole group of students (using the attached sign for help). Finding {Person2} on your flight should be easy — you could meet at the arrival gate. To connect with {Person3 and Person4} on {Airline} flight {###}, find their arrival gate and wait there, otherwise, you could all agree to meet by the exit of the secured area or something like that. Given the number of you, it may be best to plan something in advance. Feel free to email each other using this email thread.

In any case, {Person1}, as soon as the whole group is assembled, please call the DoubleTree hotel front desk at (608) 251-5511 [Best Western hotel front desk at (608) 285-8000] and request the shuttle. It is about a 20-minute drive from the hotel to the airport, but I have given your names and flight information to the hotel in hopes that they might have the shuttle ready a bit sooner. Nonetheless, it is best to call right away and find out what is going on.

If either flight is significantly delayed, such that there will be a large gap in time between flights, the pair of you on the flight that has arrived on time ({time}) should call and take the shuttle together. The others can then call for the shuttle separately upon arrival. If for any reason the hotel shuttle is unavailable to pick you up from the airport, please take a taxi and remember to save the receipt for reimbursement after the school.

Let me know if I can be of any further assistance in helping you all get from the airport to the hotel!

   * *Content Development* Ask content providers for an initial outline and then a draft set of materials. Try to get all outlines together and distribute to other instructors (as appropriate). An outline should document goals, objectives, major points, methodology used, and timing for each subsection of content; it sounds like a lot of detail, but each item can be just a single line, and a full day’s plan easily fits in a page or two. Check the outlines for a good mix of lecture and interactive segments, for appropriate content, and for gaps and overlap with other instructors’ materials. Draft materials should show the full span of the session, but may have small details missing. Check the drafts for content, style, and completeness. Make sure the hands-on portions are drafted as well, and blend well with other materials. Ideally, each section of the curriculum has extra, self-directed hands-on exercises for those students who finish the core curriculum quickly.
      * "osg-school-larp-materials-2017.pdf" is an in-class role playing exercise on Tuesday afternoon. The following pages need to be printed and cut out:

   * *Touch Base with Instructors/Helpers* 1 week prior to the school, schedule a virtual meeting with all helpers and instructors to do introductions and set expectations for the school.

   * *Linux Skills/Refresher* 1 week prior to the school, email all students and attendees regarding the Linux skills they'll need for the school. The following email contains information to get them started on learning or refreshing themselves before arriving.

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Linux skills for OSG User School next week</pre>
     <pre class="file">We are only one week away from starting the OSG User School!

During the hands-on sessions, you will spend most of your time on a remote Linux machine. The exercises at the school will explain most of the commands that you will use, but they do not explain the basics of using Linux itself. We assume that you know how to do basic things using the Linux command-line with no GUI: view files and directories, edit plain text files (not Word!), copy and move files, view and change file permissions, run programs, and so forth. You do NOT need to know a lot, but please be prepared.

If you need to improve your Linux command-line skills before the School, there are many options in books and online. One free, online source that we recommend is Software Carpentry:

http://software-carpentry.org/

For the Unix shell lessons, you can access the site directly at the below address and follow the instructions on your own laptop or other computer (Windows users should see the additional instructions, further below):

http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/

Unfortunately, Software Carpentry does not have any tutorials on using a basic, command-line text editor (such as nano, pico, vi, or emacs). Look online or in books for help there. For example, here are pages that cover the basics of using nano (introductory) and vi (more complex), two of the most common editors available:

http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/
http://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/vi.html


WINDOWS USERS READ HERE

You CAN run a command line environment on your Windows laptop to practice, and you don’t even need to run Linux on your laptop!

1. Follow the setup instructions for installing "The Bash Shell" on Windows, here: http://uw-madison-aci.github.io/2016-06-08-uwmadison/#setup

2. Open GitBash command-line terminal (a program you installed just previously) and follow Software Carpentry’s lessons for the "Unix Shell" ("Site" link) here: http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/

3. Use the 'nano' command-line text editor for creating and editing files. There are excellent online guides for nano. Here are a couple:

* *Travel Tips Reminder* A few days prior to the school, email all students and attendees with some tips and reminders.

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Tips and reminders for OSG User School next week</pre>
     <pre class="file">Hi everyone,

Here are a few tips and reminders as you prepare for the OSG User School next week. 

SCHEDULE
* Everyone is encouraged to attend the Welcome Dinner at the Fluno Center at 6:30pm on Sunday evening, July 16. For those of you staying at the Best Western, one of the OSG User School Instructors will meet you in the lobby at 6:00pm to lead the group to the Fluno. Underground parking is available for a fee at the Fluno Center for anyone who is from Madison and/or driving.
* We recently posted the Detailed Schedule for the week of the School: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17DetailedSchedule.
* Everyone is encouraged to attend the Closing Dinner at Union South at 6:30pm on Friday evening, July 21.

NON-RESIDENT ALIENS
* If you are not a United States citizen or permanent resident, please remember to bring all of the required documents with you to class on Monday. This is the list of Documents to Bring to the School: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17PersonalInfo.

TIPS
* Bring a sweater or jacket. Despite the hot summer temperatures outside, our classroom has air conditioning and is known for being very cold.
* The dress code is university/summer casual. Being an academic environment, some folks wear t-shirts and shorts, some dress up to business casual, and others are somewhere in between. Be prepared to do some walking outdoors, especially Wednesday afternoon and before/after class.
* Walking directions from the Best Western to the Computer Sciences Building: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17Location. Follow the signs to Room 1240.
* Review the website for all other logistics: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17Logistics. 
* If we arranged your flights for you, and if something goes wrong on Sunday (or next Saturday) with your flights, please contact Fox World Travel using the phone numbers that they provided on the flight confirmation page that we sent you. They are professional travel agents and can help you deal with the airlines, etc. There is very little that we can do here in Madison, so it is best to contact Fox World Travel right away, and then (if you have time) let us know what is going on, too.

REIMBURSEMENT
* If you are not from the Madison area and if we offered to pay for your travel and/or meals for the School, remember to save all of your receipts for reimbursement. More information can be found here: https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17Meals. 
* Unfortunately, if you live in or near Madison and are part of the UW-Madison community, by University rules, we cannot reimburse you for dinners during the School. 

We look forward to seeing you very soon!

* *Travel Documents Reminder* A few days prior to the school, email all non-local students with visas this reminder to bring their necessary documents.

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG User School plan for copying travel documents</pre>
     <pre class="file">Hi everyone,

During the OSG User School, we must copy and verify your important travel documents (passport, etc.). This is critical, because the University of Wisconsin–Madison requires those copies in order to pay for your School costs.

We plan to do this on Tuesday, July 18. During the morning break (starting at 10:45 a.m.), we will collect the documents. After that, Computer Sciences staff will make the copies and verify that all requirements are met. Then during the afternoon break (starting at 2:40 p.m.), we will return the documents to you.

Before you leave home, please refer to the following web page for details about which documents we need:

https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17PersonalInfo

Thank you for your help with this matter, and we hope to make it as quick and painless as possible. If you have any questions before you leave, email us as quickly as possible.

---++ Room CS 1240 Walk Through and Set Up

   * In the week prior to the school, do a walk-though of 1240.
      * Get the keys to room 1240 from Trish Rentner (2 copies – 1 for Tim, 1 for Ally?) - Keys came from the "lab" in 2017.
      * Get cleaning spray and paper towels from Trish Rentner to wipe down the tables for eating in the front of the room.
      * Ask about getting the key to the lower cabinet of the podium? (equipment has overheated in the past)
      * Test the 2 wireless mics. Make sure they have good batteries (or extras in the room) and test that you can hear in the back of the room.
      * Make sure there are 8 rectangular tables and at least 32 chairs (no wheels) in the room. Extra chairs may be stored behind the screen.
      * Test hooking up a laptop and showing Power Point slides on the projector screen and TVs.
      * Talk to Roger Vogts, the building manager (office in the hall between DoIT and Unit III), about getting an additional large trash can for room 1240 all week.
      * Note: The screen in room 1240 is not a whiteboard for markers. There is a whiteboard that slides up for you to write on.
   * The Friday before the school or over the weekend before the school, set up 1240.
      * Set up 8 rectangular tables (separated, not a long row) in the front of the room (yes, around the podium) for eating breakfast.
      * Set up 32 chairs (without wheels), 4 per table.
   * Before 8am Monday morning, set up signs in CS to direct students to 1240.
      * Ally Miller has 3 tripod stands and Nolan Lendved from WID has 4+ sign stands that can be used.
      * Put signs by each of the 3 entrances and throughout the halls leading to 1240. See the map for locations: [[https://drive.google.com/a/wisc.edu/file/d/0B5cjOR6dXdphQWtncExMb1FMX3c/view?usp=sharing]].
      * Tim has an 11x17 sign to hang from the TV outside the entrances to 1240.
      * Put a couple of signs before both sets of doors leading from the CS Learning Center/Unit III common area to 1240.
   * Each morning, arrive by 7:45am to unlock the room and set up.
      * Unlock doors – keep closed but unlocked during the day, and lock at night
      * Turn on lights
      * Adjust thermostat so the bottom of the rectangle/slider is at 75 degrees
      * Catering to arrive for breakfast setup 7:50-8:10am
   * Mon/Tues during the school, schedule a time with Hilary or a CS Admin to look at and copy travel documents for non-US citizens. This information may come from the Master or Qualtrics survey.
   * The Monday after the school is over, go back and tidy up room 1240 and return the keys to Trish.


---++ Nametags

   * Ask Trish Rentner for name tag supplies, including the holders.
   * Print a nametag for every student, helpers, infrastructure, anyone attending meals, staff/instructors, guest speakers/showcase presenters, and Miron.
   * Distribute the nametags at the welcome dinner.
   * Print a full extra set of nametags plus a few blanks (ok if on regular paper), and bring ~10 extra badge holders on Monday morning in case people forgot their nametags. Keeping extra nametag supplies around all week is helpful. Tim can hang on to nametag stuff all week to use, as needed.
   * Inevitably there will be a few drop-ins and extra attendees who will need nametags printed on-the-fly.
   * Nametag templates and examples: [[https://drive.google.com/a/wisc.edu/folderview?id=0B5cjOR6dXdphVXlmcTNtdjhJWHM&usp=sharing]]
      * Include the OSG logo and "OSG User School 20YY" at the top. 
      * Put the person's desired name/nickname (from the survey or Col Z in the master spreadsheet) in as big and bold of a font as you can in the middle. 
      * Include their last name and organization/university at the bottom.
      * Use a mail merge from the master spreadsheet.
   * Print a sign for the welcome dinner to remind students to bring their nametags to class on Monday. Put up a sign in the classroom near the door reminding students to bring their nametags back to class the next day.

---++ Welcome Letter/Login Sheet

   * Those people affiliated with the UW will use their Net ID to log in.
   * Non-UW students will need to have logins and passwords created for them (Moate in 2017). Convention:   s_YY<first name><first 3 letters of last name>.
   * Use a mail merge to generate letters with individual login information from the spreadsheet. Copying the current year's info into the previous year's spreadsheet will prevent problems with the mail merge in Word. 
      * Tim will generate the spreadsheet of student names, login names, and passwords and transfer it via flash drive.
      * Review and update the welcome letter with the current school year and any other changes.
      * Use mail merge to generate and print all of the welcome letters.
   * Hand to students first thing on Monday morning before the first talk/exercise begins.
   * Remind students to bring their login sheet with them to class every day.


---++ Daily Surveys

   * Copy the Qualtrics surveys from the previous year. 
      * Create a new folder YYYY OSG User School. In the previous year's folder, for each survey: Copy Project > Copy to Account, update the year in the name, put in the new folder. 
      * Invite Tim, Lauren, and Christina to them with full permissions. (Share Project)
   * Update the survey header to reflect the current year (Enter each survey > Look and Feel > Advanced tab > Header section).
   * Update the first question on each daily survey to reflect the correct topic and instructor names from the Detailed Schedule. 
   * Survey Options > Survey Termination section > Custom End of Survey Message > "Thank you for completing the OSG User School survey. Your response has been recorded. Remember to bring your name tag and login information with you to class tomorrow!"
   * Send survey links to the list and have them review/suggest edits.
   * Email Tim the final anonymous survey links every day before 3pm (before 12noon on Wed.) or send the links for each survey for the entire week to the list at the beginning of the week. Tim will email the class to fill out the survey at the end of each day. Remind Tim to remind everyone to remember to bring their nametags and login sheets to class the next day.
   * Sample email to the students each day:

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG School evaluation form for <Day> <M/DD></pre>
     <pre class="file">Here is the link for the OSG User School evaluation form for <Day>, July <##>. Please complete the brief survey once and only once! It is completely anonymous.

{qualtrics link here}

Notes:

• Question 1 is about what you ALREADY knew before today; the rest of the questions about what you have learned.
• The scale-based questions are very helpful, and it would be great if you did them all.
• However, the free-form text questions often provide the most insight, so give time for them as well.

Also, remember to bring your name tag and login information back to class with you tomorrow.

— Tim</pre>

   * Review the previous day's survey results for anything that can be corrected on-the-fly for the next day/rest of the week. 
      * Download the results, clean up the spreadsheet, color-code the responses, and highlight feedback for improvement. Send to the list.
      * Pass on any feedback about the catering or hotel, if needed.

     <pre class="file">Attaching the survey results from yesterday (<DAY>’s class).

Lots of positive comments/good feedback for <NAME> (see columns # and #). 
I put the exported survey results into the OSG User School > Survey Responses Folder and attached them.
I color-coded the answers (none/a bit/some/a lot/tons) and highlighted any suggestions for improvement or problems reported in the free response questions section. (In the case of similar feedback, I highlighted 1 representative example, i.e. more time for hands-on exercises.)

-OR-

I color-coded the answers (none/a bit/some/a lot/tons; strongly agree/strongly disagree/agree/disagree/neither) and highlighted suggestions for improvement or problems reported in the free response questions sections. (In the case of similar feedback, I highlighted 1 representative example).</pre>

---+++ Wednesday Activity Survey

   * Create a survey to send out on Tuesday at lunch time to know what all students are planning to do on Wednesday afternoon.
   * This survey should NOT be anonymous.
   * Send the compiled results to the list and all other instructors/activity group leaders on Wednesday morning. Show total number of individuals for each activity and names of individuals. 

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG User School - Wednesday Activity Survey</pre>
     <pre class="file">Hi everyone,
 
Here is the link for the OSG User School Wednesday Activity Survey. We’d like to know what you are planning to do!
{qualtrics link here}
 
Note that we need to collect your names on this one so we can coordinate group activities.
 
Thanks!
 
~Ally</pre>


---++ Printing Boarding Passes on Friday
   * On Friday morning, announce to the class and send an email offering to print boarding passes for those with Saturday flights. Students should email the list a PDF of their boarding pass after checking in for their flight. Ally or someone at CS will print boarding passes and return them to students around lunchtime.

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Printing Boarding Passes</pre>
     <pre class="file">Hi everyone,
 
We’d like to help you print your boarding passes in preparation for your flights home. Please email the list <user-school@opensciencegrid.org> with a PDF of your boarding pass. The OSG instructors will handle printing and delivering boarding passes during class breaks on Friday.
 
Thanks!

[SIGNATURE]</pre>


---++ Mentoring Plan

For the 2011 School, we have some new ideas for making the Mentoring system a bit more robust:

   * Send a survey to students at 3, 6, and 12 months after the School. Ask students about: contact with mentor and community at large; progress on HTC projects; open questions.
   * Have one follow-up call with students and mentors, maybe right after the 3-month survey. Ask how things are going and how to improve.
   * Require contact reports from mentors every two months. Ask about: number of contacts, reason(s) for lack of contact if so, and a basic progress update.

---++ Follow-Up Events

Students who continue to be involved in HTC work should be invited to participate in other events:

   * *OSG All-Hands Meeting* Find out the !AHM schedule well in advance (3–4 months), plan how to integrate students into event with organizers, identify strong candidates, find budget for travel, invite students, etc.
   * *Condor Week* Similar process, mostly for students working in/with Condor itself. Consider inviting to present, or set up a poster session and make sure attendees are driven toward it.

---++ Cleaning up After the School

   * Remove all directional signs and collect sign stands from the classroom, building hallways, and CS Learning Center/Unit III common area
   * Clean up the classroom itself: stack chairs, move tables in front of room, wipe down tables
   * Return cleaning supplies and left over tablecloths to Patricia/Trish Rentner on the 5th floor
   * Make sure catering has retrieved all of their stuff from CS 1240. If not, contact Joe.
   * Return power cords and key to room 1420
   * Make sure all materials are posted online or emailed to the students


---++ Final Bills and Invoices

   * After receiving the final hotel bill(s), create a line-item spreadsheet of all charges. Verify all charges are correct, and address any changes with the hotel. Once a correct bill has been received, Tim will do some calculations in the master spreadsheet and start the payment process.
   * After receiving the final catering bills, review all charges and address any changes with the caterers. Once a correct bill has been received, Tim will start the payment process.


---++ Extra Info for planning
Additional details that can be useful for planning purposes

---+++ Location of conference

   * For the conference, we need a room available all day, for 4 days, usually Monday-Thursday. We have been having the conference in Computer Sciences (2010: 4310; 2011: 1240; 2012: 1240). For 2016, Computer Science room 1240 was reserved for the entire week of the school, 25-29 July.
We would like to have it not in Union South, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed first:
People: every year we have been expanding the School more and more (it was 17 students in 2010, 25 students in 2011, 30 students in 2012). It has become more of an issue dealing with space. 1240 is a big lecture hall so it will fit plenty of people.
   * Union South: While we get discounts to Union South and we rent the space for free, we still need to pay for AV charges, and that is not budgeted. So unless we a) have our own AV system we can use (which I don't think we can do) or b) figure out how to get it for free or c) budget for AV, we cannot have the event at Union South
Teaching Labs @ WID: We can use the Teaching Labs, but the biggest problem is availability. It fills up very quickly, and we've never been able to make it work (so far). The other issue is that there would probably be a fee for using the space, but that's not positive. They have changed their rules a bunch (as they work through the kinks from opening the building). However, the teaching labs are a great space, and if we can use it for free (ie. without having to pay for AV or space fees), then we should use it if it's available. I think their capacity is around 40 people.
Other possible locations are Memorial Union, the Pyle Center and the Lowell Center and Fluno.

---+++ Meals

   * Menus: The state rate for meals (as of April 2016) is $12 (breakfast), $18 (lunch), $30 (dinner), $10 (refreshments). Obviously, from where we order depends on where the event is, but here are some ideas based on what we've done in the past.
      * Where/how to find the state rates: http://www.bussvc.wisc.edu/acct/policy/meetcon/meetcon.html
   * Breakfast/Lunch: If the event is in a non-Union location, (WID or CS for example) we can order catering from UW-Housing. They are very nice, and they've always given us fantastic service. The contact is Joe Mehring, and they are always happy to do service with us. I usually contact them 3 months before to verify that they are available (mid-March for conference at the end of June).
      * 1 week before the school, schedule a meeting with Tim and Joe and/or the UW-Housing catering team to do a walk-through of the CS Learning Center/Unit III space where breakfasts and lunches will be served. Follow the same plan as the year before, teaching any new staff and refreshing everyone's memory from last year. 
         * Breakfasts and afternoon refreshments will be in room 1240. 
            * Catering should set up the food/drink on the last row of tables in the back of the room to one side. 
            * Students will eat breakfast on tables set up down in the front of the room.
         * Use the counters with cabinets to the right of the CS Learning Center/Unit III space to set up lunch and the buffet lines. Catering will need to bring 2 extra rectangular tables to support 2 buffet lines in the space next to the cabinets.
         * Students will be eating lunch in the CS Learning Center/Unit III common area and in the classroom.
If the event is at Union South, you will need to cater through Union South. However, don't order from Union South if the event is in CS or WID. There's a $30 ($35?) delivery fee for each delivery outside Union South. (ie. $60/day or $70/day for our food. We cannot afford that and it is ridiculous.)
If the event is at WID in the teaching labs, we can do catering from UW-Housing. As long as the event is not on the 1st floor, we do not have to use WID catering.
   * WID Lunch: In the past, we tried to have one or two lunches at WID, catered by WID. In order to do so, we needed to get extra funds from Miron (usually through the OSG grant) since most of their lunches are not at the state rates. We stopped doing this in the past 2 years. So, after lunch on Friday, we take a group photo at WID and Lauren/Christina split the group up into 2 to do a very quick WID building tour.
   * Dinners: 
      * For three nights (usually Mon, Tues, Wed), the students are on their own for dinner, but we do reimburse them for the expenses. 
      * We have two dinners that we do with the entire group, on the day before the conference (usually Sunday), and on the last day of the conference (usually Thursday/Friday). It is getting difficult to find a good place to have these dinners (since they are going to be about 40 people starting in 2012). Some suggestions (which I am looking into for 2012) are: Union South, Pyle, Lowell, Memorial Union, and the Fluno Center. We would like to have the Sunday dinner at Union South and then the Thursday/Friday dinner on the second floor terrace outside at Memorial Union.

---++++ Food allergies and dietary restrictions
   * The week before the school, reach out to everyone with food allergies and dietary restrictions. Sample email from 2017 is below.
      * Food allergy, no pork example
     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Dietary needs at the OSG User School</pre>
     <pre class="file">{NAME}:

Long ago, you told us that you are allergic to peanuts and blueberries, and that you do not eat pork. I just wanted to let you know that we have been working closely with all of our food vendors to make sure that there are no problems for you.

Anything that contains peanuts or could be cross-contaminated with peanuts will be labeled as such. Likewise with blueberries, and plus I specifically asked the breakfast folks to avoid blueberries altogether in the otherwise very nice fruit salads that we will get on some mornings. And as for pork, there is either none in any of the dishes or very little and it will be labeled.

Let us know if there is anything else that we can do for you and food!

—Tim</pre>
      * Vegan example
     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Dietary needs at the OSG User School</pre>
     <pre class="file">{NAME}:

Long ago, you told us that you are vegan. I just wanted to let you know that we have been working closely with all of our food vendors to make sure that there are no problems for you.

There will be vegan food options at all of our catered meals. We do a lot of buffets, so in some cases there just are vegan options to begin with, and they should be either labeled as such or will lack any warnings about meat, dairy, eggs, etc. In other cases, there will be specific vegan items prepared for you. In all cases, the servers should know what’s going on and you can ask them for help. And feel free to remind me! With so much going on, I can forget certain details, so it’s totally fine to check in with me about your options.

Let us know if there is anything else that we can do for you and food!

—Tim</pre>
      * Gluten-free example
     <pre class="file">[Subject:] Dietary needs at the OSG User School</pre>
     <pre class="file">{NAME}:

Long ago, you told us that you are gluten-free. I just wanted to let you know that we have been working closely with all of our food vendors to make sure that there are no problems for you.

There will be gluten-free food options at all of our catered meals. We do a lot of buffets, so in some cases there just are GF options to begin with, and they should be either labeled as such or will lack any warnings about containing gluten. In other cases, there will be specific GF items prepared or brought for you (and one other GF participant). In all cases, the servers should know what’s going on and you can ask them for help. And feel free to remind me! With so much going on, I can forget certain details, so it’s totally fine to check in with me about your options.

Let us know if there is anything else that we can do for you and food!

—Tim</pre>


---++++ Menus

   * Make reservations and confirm dates for all catering 3-4 months prior to the school. In 2016, the opening dinner was at the Fluno Center, breakfasts/lunch/PM refreshments for the week went through UW-Housing, and the closing dinner was at Union South.
   * Create the food menus 2-3 months before the school. Every meal should be adequate for vegetarians. You can mostly copy the menu from the year before, incorporating feedback, if needed.
      * Ask for everyone's food allergies and dietary restrictions (gluten-free, vegan, Kosher, etc.). Be sure to ask all of the internal staff and instructors. Provide this list to all caterers.
      * Ask the caterers for menu clarifications or suggestions/changes where dietary needs are concerned.
      * Buffet-style meals are preferred. Plated meals will require a survey for everyone to select an entree.
   * Get an accurate head count for all meals. Include all students, staff, instructors, etc. Keep in mind late arrivals, early departures, and staff/instructors who won't attend all week.

---+++ Miscellaneous

   * Email addresses: You'll need to set up an email address to disseminate information. We create one every year, and the instructions are here: Creating the Gridschool Info Email Address
In 2011, the list was created on February 27.
   * Applicants/Attendees (and their issues): Dealing with the applicants and the attendees can be frustrating at times because of all the unforeseen issues that come up. Patience, politeness, and kindness are necessary when dealing with all the issues and questions. We had around 95 applicants for the 2011 school so we always need a way to organize the applicants and make sure nothing is dropped. Our solution has been to create a spreadsheet on Google Docs (through UW-Madison) which details name, application date, letter of recommendation send date, etc.
   * Preparing the application: In the two weeks to a week before the application goes live, whatever HTCondor Staff is in charge of event will edit the application questions for any number of issues (ie. maybe they want to ask different technical questions, or maybe we want to add a logistical question that we missed the previous year, or maybe we wanted to leave out a question). Once s/he has edited the application, a few people will submit proxy applications to make sure it works.
   * Posting the Application: The application gets posted around the beginning of March for a conference that is held at the end of June. There is a one month period where the application is live. For 2012, applications were posted on March 5 and are due March 30. The program committee (for 2012 - Alain and Tim) get 2 weeks to review the applications and make their decisions. For 2012, the notification date is April 16.
   * Advertising: Once the application for the OSG User School goes live (in 2011 it was on Monday, March 5), we need to advertise to various locations so people will apply to attend. We have three groups which we target, and hopefully they disseminate the information (like we ask them to) so we can get a wide variety of good applicants.
   * Campus Tour: Lauren has had Katie help with booking a campus walking tour. They book up quickly and in advance in the summer, so plan far ahead for a large group tour.

---+++ Notification Emails

Remember to CC and Reply-To &lt;user-school@opensciencegrid.org&gt; on every email.

---+++ Preparing for Attendance

   * In order to be reimbursed for the expenses that they will be accruing during the conference (food, taxi), the students must be US citizens or have current home country passport and US visa. As will be detailed below, you will need to photocopy their passport and visa for the reimbursement process. We are currently working on when we will be asking the students for their information. Obviously, it is not a requirement for attendance, but if they want to be reimbursed at all for their hotel, all food, any transportation, they must have a current visa and passport from time of application to the conclusion of the school.
Most likely, we will ask the students for their visa information after they are accepted to the school. It will come in a separate email, and we will ask for pdfs of the passport and visa right away so that it does not become an issue later.
      * Talk to CS Travel staff the week before the school to identify a time for them to pick up, copy, and return all student travel documentation that is needed.
      * Identify all non-UW/local students who have a visa from the Master spreadsheet. Email them the week before the school to remind them what documents to bring.

     <pre class="file">[Subject:] OSG User School plan for copying travel documents</pre>
     <pre class="file">During the OSG User School, we must copy and verify your important travel documents (passport, etc.). This is critical, because the University of Wisconsin–Madison requires those copies in order to pay for your School costs.

We plan to do this on Tuesday, July 18. During the morning break (starting at 10:45 a.m.), we will collect the documents. After that, Computer Sciences staff will make the copies and verify that all requirements are met. Then during the afternoon break (starting at 2:40 p.m.), we will return the documents to you.

Before you leave home, please refer to the following web page for details about which documents we need:

https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Education/UserSchool17PersonalInfo

Thank you for your help with this matter, and we hope to make it as quick and painless as possible. If you have any questions before you leave, email us as quickly as possible.

3. Implementing the conference
Like other conferences you (the PA) will plan, you should plan to be available and working for the majority of the conference. You will want to be on hand for any problems that may arise. Also, you will benefit from the availability of food. You probably won't be needed the entire time, but it's good to have a presence because you will have been dealing with the attendees the most, and usually they enjoy seeing you there. Also, Miron likes to see you there.
Often during the conference, I will bring my computer down to the room and do work there during the talks. This allows you to maximize your time, so that you aren't falling behind on things like travel, but it also allows you to have a presence at the school that has proved to be invaluable. Students often have questions about reimbursements or random logistics, and if you are right there, ready and willing to answer those questions, it looks good for us. Again, Miron likes this kind of visibility. Obviously, you are not being forced to work overtime, or anything beyond the hours that you are scheduled to work each week.
Review sheets

In my opinion, one of the best aspects of doing conferences for Condor is that everyone wants to improve for the next year. Instead of being happy with just the status quo, there is a constant effort to improve the experience for the attendees. Therefore, after every session, we have review sheets where the students are asked several questions about the session. We have examples from previous years.
Collecting receipts

Collecting any other info

---+++ Set-up/Loose Ends

One of the things to watch out for are any technical issues with the AV, and making sure someone comes to fix it if the Condor Staff cannot. Someone (usually the PA) needs to be available in the morning to open the conference room (if in CS) to let in the catering people so they can set up breakfast. The pre-determined time should be set up with whomever is catering the breakfasts. If the PA is not available, then someone else needs to be there (preferable Tim since he is also organizing things). In CS1240, there are tables and chairs that should be set up on the floor of the conference room as space for people to eat and for people to do extra exercises during the lectures. This has been wildly successful (surprisingly so), so we like to have this extra space for use. If in the future we have the school at another location, this is something to keep in mind. It's great to have an extra space for people to be "social". At the end of the day, there needs to be someone who closes up the conference room and make sure it's locked for the night. Whoever takes the key will be the one to open up the room the next morning.
If there is any point during the day when the entire room is empty, one of two things needs to happen: The doors to the conference room need to be totally closed and locked. We will have everyone leave their stuff there, and if someone steals the stuff, that's bad. Someone needs to stay in the room with the stuff to watch out for it (usually the PA). It's often better to just lock up the room. The AV in CS1240 can be tricky, but the Condor staff can set it up. 
If the conference is in another location, you will need to coordinate with the AV staff at the location to make sure everything is working properly. Also, you'll need to know how to contact them in case anything gets messed up (which it probably will - Murphy's Law).


---+ After the School

---++ Upload Presentations to Materials Website
   * Upload a copy of all presentations to the school Materials (UserSchool%RED%YY%ENDCOLOR%Materials) page.
   * Email Miron and the Showcase presenters to get a copy of their slides. Note that the PDF must be under 10,000 KB to be uploaded to the twiki.

   * Ally to track incoming reimbursement requests in master spreadsheet. Back fill columns that were estimates with actual expenses (e.g. bus ticket). Make sure all cells in the student's row are filled in, including $0 amounts.
      * Cols AO-AS in 2017 for travel expenses (air, bus, car, taxi, parking-move to hotel) and remove special formatting from everything in that row (bold/blue to regular/black). Bold/Blue in Cols AL to AN indicates that the expense may have been paid by student and NOT by Fox World Travel/UW.
      * Col BH in 2017 for lodging expenses (parking in Col AS in 2017). We separated UW payment from Individual payment for lodging expenses.
      * Cols BQ-BU in 2017 for dinners Mon-Thurs (make sure none are over $27, no locals)
      * Cols BZ-CD in 2017 for totals of the above (BZ - date student request received; CA - reference =$AT##; CB - reference =$BH##; CC - reference =$BU##; CD - total)
      * Col CE for date sent to UWCS/CS Travel
      * Col CF (to UW) is the date CS Travel entered the reimbursement with the university
      * Col CG (WISDM) is the date the reimbursement posted in WISDM
   * Ally to acknowledge reimbursement requests and respond to the student if there are any issues/major changes.

     <pre class="file">Hi {NAME},

Thank you for submitting your travel reimbursement request for the OSG User School. 

Your total of $##.## looks good, so we will move forward with processing your reimbursement.

Your adjusted total will be $##.## due to {the $27.00 limit for each meal reimbursement - OR - whatever reason for the adjustment}.

</pre>

   * Ally to forward reviewed and finalized reimbursement requests to CS Travel (cstravel@cs.wisc.edu), and CC the list. The email title should be "OSG User School YYYY Reimbursement Request for {Student Name}".
      * Ally to review all requests and note changes in the:
         * Student mailing address, phone number, or SSN. Any changes will need to be updated in the student's UW travel profile.
            * Compare the address in the reimbursement request with the address in the Travelers spreadsheet from when travel was booked.
         * Reimbursement total. Correct totals, sub-totals, or other amounts in the student's form and note the correct total in the email to CS Travel.
         * Driving reimbursements that differ from the prearranged amount. (Reference old emails for distance/mileage calculations and itineraries for the lowest fare for a comparable flight.) This is based on a distance/mileage calculation and/or the lowest fare for a comparable round trip flight. Attach an email for reference where we approve/agree on driving/mileage.
      * Check for: missing receipts (esp. parking and taxis over $25), taxi receipts without all passengers' names, meal reimbursements over $27 each (correct in email to CS Travel and spreadsheet)
      * Contact the hotel if a student is missing their parking receipt.

   * CS Travel should let the list know when reimbursement requests are submitted to UW for processing.
   * After a few weeks, CS Travel or Tim will check WISDM to see if the reimbursements have been "paid" and enter the "paid" date into the Master spreadsheet, column BY.
   * Follow up with everyone to see if they received their check yet, and if so, what the dollar amount was. Record the check amount in the Master spreadsheet, column BZ (Check $). The "Diff" (column CA) should calculate automatically. Reply back to the student with "Perfect! Thanks!" if everything looks good on our end.
