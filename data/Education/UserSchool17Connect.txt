   2. <p>After you have signed in or created a Globus ID, you will be asked to link an existing account or continue with the current Globus account. Click on the &ldquo;No Thanks, continue&rdquo; button to continue the application process.</p>
   3. <p>To complete your sign up, submit an application to join the "osg" project. It is important that you *choose your Globus ID in the username dropdown menu*. (If not sure, take a close look at Figure&nbsp;3 in the OSG Connect sign up page.)</p>
    
In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that acknowledges the receipt of your application.
