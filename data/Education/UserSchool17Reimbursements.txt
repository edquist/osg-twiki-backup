---+ Getting Reimbursed for Expenses

If you paid for certain expenses to attend the OSG User School 2017, then we will reimburse you for them. This page explains what can be reimbursed and how to request reimbursement. Please read this whole page carefully before submitting your request.

*The deadline for all reimbursement submissions is <span style="color: #F60;">Friday, September 29, 2017.</span>*

---++ What Can Be Reimbursed?

We offered to reimburse certain expenses that were part of attending the OSG School:

   * Bus fare to/from Madison
   * Taxi to/from Madison airport
   * Driving mileage (if prearranged)
   * Dinners Monday–Thursday (up to $27 per dinner)
   * Hotel bill (in special, prearranged cases only)

Unfortunately, we are not able to reimburse you for any other expenses (e.g. checked baggage fees).

---++ What Information Is Needed?

The University of Wisconsin–Madison has strict requirements about reimbursements. See below for each type of expense and its rules.

*If you received an actual paper receipt, you must mail it to us for reimbursement. You may not scan/email copies of actual paper receipts!* <br>
If you only received an electronic copy of your receipt, then you can just forward the email to us. 


| *Expense* | *Rules* |
| <p>Bus fare</p> | <p>For bus trips between Madison and a nearby airport, as planned with us in advance.</p><p>The original receipt is required, including at least the total amount paid.</p> |
| <p>Taxi fare</p> | <p>For trips between the Madison airport and your hotel. Taxi rides in your home town are not covered.</p><p>If you paid for other School participants, list their names.
