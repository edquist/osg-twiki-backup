---++ Reimbursements

Almost all of your expenses are pre-paid. There are two important things to know:

   1. We have prepaid your hotel. However, the hotel requires you to provide your credit card when you check in. This will be used for any extra expenses you incur. For instance, we won't be paying for your movies or other minor expenses.
   1. You will be on your own for dinners Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. You'll need to apply for a reimbursement yourself. To get your money back, you'll need to do three things.
      1. Keep receipts for your meals. You cannot exceed %RED%$NN%ENDCOLOR%/day. We cannot pay for alcohol, just food.
      1. Fill out reimbursement form *TBD*
      1. Print it, sign it, and mail it with a your receipts and a nice note to our reimbursement experts saying you came to the school as well as thanking them for their hard work. Mail it no later than *DATE* to: *TBD*
