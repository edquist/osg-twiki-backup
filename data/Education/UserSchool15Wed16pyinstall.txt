---+ Wednesday Exercise 1.6: Python Installation

In this exercise, you will write a wrapper script that installs Python and then use it to run jobs. This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

---++ Background

In the previous exercise, we used a method that pre-built Python and then used that pre-built package to run Python scripts.  In this 
exercise, we will use an alternative method for running Python jobs, by writing a wrapper script that installs Python with every job.  This exercise 
should be done in the same directory as the previous exercise - you will need the same Python source code and =fib.py= script.  

---++ Wrapper script

Our wrapper script will need to install Python from the source code and then run our =fib.py= script.  

   1. Based on the previous exercise, what are the steps we need to install Python?  What file can we use for reference?  
   1. Put the installation steps into a script called =run_py.sh=
   2. Check your script against the file below \
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

export PATH

mkdir python
tar xzf Python-2.7.10.tgz
cd Python-2.7.10
./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/../python
make
make install
cd ..
</pre>\

   1. We also need to run our =fib.py= script.  We can do so by adding our installation location to the =PATH=, or by referencing the installation directly: 
     <pre class="file"> export PATH=$(pwd)/python/bin:$PATH
python fib.py 5</pre>\
     or\
      <pre class="file"> python/bin/python fib.py 5</pre> \
   Choose whichever method you prefer, and add it to your =run_py.sh= script.   
   1. Make your =run_py.sh= script executable.  

---++ Submit file

The submit file for this exercise can be very similar to the [[UserSchool15Wed15pybuilt][last one from Exercise 1.5]].  

   1. Make a copy of the submit file from the last exercise.  What lines need to change?  Make changes as appropriate.  
   1. Submit the job using =condor_submit=.
   1. Check for the results in the =.out= file.
