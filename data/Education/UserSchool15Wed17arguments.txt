---+ Bonus: Passing Arguments Through the Wrapper Script

In this exercise, you will submit multiple Python jobs using the materials from Exercises 1.5 and 1.6.  This exercise should take 5 minutes.  

---++ Background

So far, the exercises from this morning have focused on software portability methods that are applicable to DHTC.  In an attempt to focus on this software aspect, we have been running single jobs instead of large job batches.  However, the end goal would be to run many jobs that use these software portability techniques.  This exercise will show one way to use arguments with a wrapper script to differentiate jobs.  

---++ Submitting Multiple Fibonacci Jobs

Let's suppose that we want to run multiple jobs using our Fibonacci script, where each job produces a single Fibonacci number.
