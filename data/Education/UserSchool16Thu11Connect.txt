---+ !!Thursday Exercise 1.1: Getting Acquainted with OSG Connect
%TOC% 

For some of the later exercises we'll point you to the OSG Connect helpdesk tutorials, since these have been developed specifically with OSG Connect in mind.

---++ Signing up and Logging in to OSG Connect
Hopefully you've already signed up for OSG Connect, if not please visit this page: http://osgconnect.net/signup

Once you've signed up, SSH to =username@login.osgconnect.net= with the username and password you created. 

---++ Get Acquainted with the OSG Connect Submit Server

---+++ Look around your 'home' directory

You'll notice the 'data', 'public', and 'stash' directories, which may be used in various specific OSG Connect guides. You'll use these spaces for different reasons. *Make sure to read the OSG Connect helpdesk guides* on [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000006512-guidelines-for-data-managment-in-osg-storage-and-transfer][data management]] and [[https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000002985-storage-solutions-on-osg-home-stash-and-public][storage solutions]].

---+++ Run =condor_q=

You will also notice that a "condor_q" command allows you to see everyone's jobs, by default. This is because OSG Connect is still running an older version of HTCondor, which you can also check and compare to the version on the =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= and =osg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu= servers:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_version</strong>
</pre>

If you'd like to see just your own jobs in future exercises, run =condor_q username=, inserting your username, appropriately.

*Additionally*, take note that this version of HTCondor lacks the various options for using =queue= statements to indicate many jobs at once. Though, you can still use =queue <#>= to queue many processes, as this is an older HTCondor feature.

---+++ Run =condor_status=

Running =condor_status= by itself on OSG Connect will give no output, but you can otherwise check with:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_status -pool osg-flock.grid.iu.edu</strong>
</pre>

---++ Look around the OSG Connect Website

   1. Go to http://osgconnect.net and select "Sign In" from the "Sign In/Sign Up" drop-down menu at the top right.
   1. After logging in, check out your "Home" and "Group" pages from the drop-down menu under your name at the top right.
   1. Also check out the links under "Resources", as well as "Connect">"My Projects" (and click "Allow" if asked), and "Account".

---++ Visit the Helpdesk Materials

From the OSG Connect main page (while logged in), select "Helpdesk" from the "Support" drop-down in the top menu bar. You'll be using some of these in the following exercises.

---+++ Move on to the next exercise when you're ready to submit jobs!
