---+ Tuesday Exercise 1.4: Submitting Older Jobs Remotely

The goal of this exercise is to submit a job from one of Monday's exercises so that it runs in the OSG.

---++ Copying your old files

Instead of repeating all the hard work you did yesterday, you will want to just copy your files from =osg-ss-submit=. For this exercise, you will be running the Fibonacci job from Monday's exercise 2.4. Once you are logged in to =osg-ss-glidein-submit=, you can copy the directory containing =random-seed.pl= and its corresponding submit file via =scp= to your home directory under a new name:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% scp -r osg-ss-submit:<span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">&lt;directory containing desired files&gt;</span> ~/tue-1.4
</pre>

For example, if =/home/blin/mon-2.5/random-seed= on =osg-ss-submit= contained my submit and executable files, my =scp= command would look like the following:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% scp -r osg-ss-submit:mon-2.5/random-seed ~/tue-1.4
</pre>

Once you have copied over your directory, change into it and remove any extraneous log, output, and error files with the =rm= command.

---++ Submitting your job to the OSG

So how do you submit a job so that it's run in the OSG? Exactly as you did before! =osg-ss-glidein-submit= has been specially configured to submit jobs to the OSG pool while =osg-ss-submit= is reserved for submitting to the local pool.

Go ahead and submit your job. How do the results compare to your job from Monday?

---+++ Extra challenge

Now that you have submitted simple remote jobs, can you do something more advanced? Try copying over and submitting the DAG from Monday's exercise 3.2 to the OSG.
