---+ Tuesday Exercise 3.1: Troubleshooting a DAG

The goal of this exercise is to troubleshoot some common problems that you may encounter when submitting a DAG using HTCondor. This exercise will likely take you longer than the allotted one hour of time; don't fret, there is an answer key provided, so work at your own pace.

---++ Part 1: Acquiring the materials

The materials for this exercise are located on our web server.

   1. Log into =learn.chtc.wisc.edu=
   1. Use =wget= to retrieve the materials from the web server:\
   <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool16/tues_31.tar.gz</pre>
   1. Extract the tarball using the commands you learned from today's exercise 1.2
   1. Change into the directory extracted from the tarball and explore its contents

---++ Part 2: Finding anagramic squares 

The contents of the tarball that you've extracted contain a DAG that is designed to solve [[https://projecteuler.net/problem=98][Project Euler problem 98]]:

<pre class="file">
By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively,
we form a square number: 1296 = 362. What is remarkable is that, by using the
same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number:
9216 = 962. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify
further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have
the same digital value as another letter.

Using =words.txt=, a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words,
find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an
anagram of itself).

What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?

NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.
</pre>

Unfortunately, there are many issues with the DAG and you will have to work through them all before you can you can obtain the solution to the problem! Submit the DAG and use your newfound HTCondor troubleshooting knowledge to work through the problems that you find.

---+++ Answer key

There is also a working solution on our web server that can be retrieved with

<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool16/tues_31_answer.tar.gz</pre>

It contains comments that you can consult in case you get stuck. Like any answer key, it's mainly useful as a verification tool, so try to only use it as a last resort or for additional illumination.
