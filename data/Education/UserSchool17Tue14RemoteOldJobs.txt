---+ Tuesday Exercise 1.4: Submitting Older Jobs Remotely

The goal of this exercise is to submit a job from one of Monday's exercises so that it runs in the OSG.

---++ Copying your old files

Instead of repeating all the hard work you did yesterday, you will want to just copy your files from =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= to =osg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu=. For this exercise, you will be running the circlepi job from Monday's exercise 2.4. Once you are logged in to =learn.chtc.wisc.edu=, you can copy the directory containing =circlepi= and its corresponding submit file via =scp= to your home directory on =osg-learn-chtc.wisc.edu= as a new directory, e.g. =tues-1.4=. Once you have copied over your directory, change into it and remove any extraneous log, output, and error files with the =rm= command.

---++ Submitting your job to the OSG

So how do you submit a job so that it's run in the OSG? Exactly as you did before! =osg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu= has been specially configured to submit jobs to the OSG pool while =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= is reserved for submitting to the local pool.

Go ahead and submit your job. How do the results compare to your job from Monday?

---+++ Extra challenge

Now that you have submitted simple remote jobs, can you do something more advanced? Try copying over and submitting the DAG from Monday's exercise 3.2 to the OSG.
