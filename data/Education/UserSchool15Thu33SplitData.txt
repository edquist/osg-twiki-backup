---+ Exercise 3.3 : Multiple query files

In the previous exercises (Exercise 3.1  and 3.2), we focused on how to do a BLAST search against a database that has been split up.  This exercise will generalize this to using multiple query files.  We'll use two different query files =HLA.txt= and =BRAC1.txt= and create a set of jobs that'll query both those files. The job submission files are generated through ==blast_gen.bash== script, open this file up and update it so that it'll create job submission script for both query files.  Then submit the queries, and check the outputs to make sure that it is running the BLAST search correctly.


---++Additional information

In the blast search example, we utilized a bash script to take care of submitting multiple jobs. A better alternative is to utilize the workflow manager such as DAGMan or Pegasus since workflow managers will automatically retry failed jobs and handle data transfers between jobs for you.  We've covered DAGMan earlier this week, if you'd like to see Pegasus in use, you can look at  https://github.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-pegasus-blast.
