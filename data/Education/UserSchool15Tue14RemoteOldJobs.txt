---+ Tuesday Exercise 1.4: Converting older jobs to run remotely

The goal of this exercise is to convert a job from one of Monday's exercise so that it is able to run out in the OSG. 

---++ Copying Your Old Files

Instead of repeating all the hard work you did yesterday, you will want to just copy your files from =osg-ss-submit=. For this exercise, you will be running the random number generator job from the end of Monday's exercise 2.5. Once you are logged in to =osg-ss-glidein-submit=, you can copy the directory containing =random-seed.pl= and its corresponding submit file via =scp= to your home directory under a new name:

<pre class="file">
scp -r osg-ss-submit:<span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">&lt;directory containing desired files&gt;</span> ~/tue-1.4
</pre>

For example, if =/home/blin/mon-2.5/random-seed= on =osg-ss-submit= contained my submit file and executable file, my =scp= command would look like the following:

<pre class="file">
scp -r osg-ss-submit:mon-2.5/random-seed ~/tue-1.4
</pre>

Go ahead and delete any extraneous log, output, and error files from the =tue-1.4= directory with the =rm= command.

---++ Converting and Submitting Your Job

Turning a local cluster job into one that can run out on the OSG is incredibly simple, you did it in your last exercise. Can you guess how to do it? If you guessed adding =+WantGlidein=True= to your submit file, you're right! Go ahead and do that for the submit file that you copied over and submit the file.
