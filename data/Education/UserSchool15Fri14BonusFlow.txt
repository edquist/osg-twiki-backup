---+ Friday Exercise 1.4: Bonus Workflow Modifications

If you finish the entire workflow and are thirsty for more, try any of the following in whatever order you like:

---+++ Bonus 1
Take the workflow to the submit server for the Open Science Grid (osg-ss-glidein-submit), and run it there. 
   * Do all of the jobs complete successfully? (You may need to look at the =run*.out= files, which are the log created by the wrapper and indicating any errors.)
   * If there are any errors (likely related to machine differences and/or software dependencies), what measures might you be able to take to re-run jobs until they land on a machine to complete successfully?

---+++ Bonus 2
Rerun the workflow again with four times the permutations (keeping a total of 100,000 permutations per trait). Which finished in an overall faster time? Why?

---+++ Bonus 3
You probably noticed that the job processes from the _permutation_ step create many log, out, and error files. Modify the _permutation_ submit files either to consolidate these files for all processes, or to have the files created in a subdirectory. You may wish to direct other files to subdirectories as well. Look back at the Day 1 material for ways to do this.
