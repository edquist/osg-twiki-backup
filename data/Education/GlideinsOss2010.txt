---+ Glidein Hands-on Session, Wednesday July 21st, 2010 

<b><font size=+2 color=red>Work in progress</font></b>

This session will give you hands-on experience in using the glideinWMS.

The session is logically split in three pieces:
   * [[GlideinsUserOss2010][Glideins from the user point of view]]
   * [[GlideinsVoOss2010][glideinWMS for the VO administrator]]
   * [[GlideinsFactoryOss2010][glideinWMS for the factory administrator]]

All users should go through the first part (for the [[GlideinsUserOss2010][users]]);<br>
the other two are optional.

I strongly encourage all users to look at the [[GlideinsVoOss2010][frontend]] part;<br>
it is likely you will get involved in that part since you attended this school!

The [[GlideinsFactoryOss2010][glidein factory]] part is instead meant to be for CS students
that want to know more about the internals of the glideins.
