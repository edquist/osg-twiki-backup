---+ 2012 Africa Grid School

Part of the <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=145296">Second Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications</a>

During the school, August 6-8, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[AfricaGridSchool12Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.
