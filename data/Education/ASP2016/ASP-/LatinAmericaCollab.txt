---+ Collaboration between Latin American Grid Infrastructure and OSG

Wiki to coordinate actions and discussions to build an International Latin American Grid Insfrastructure with some help from OSG. 

%TOC% 
---++ Members
This section is to compile the list list of countries involved or interested in this project. For each one it would be nice to have also the list of institutions (universities, laboratories, partners...) involved, the name of the person(s) responsible from that institution, the list of scientific project that eventually will use the Grid Infrastructure, and any other relevant information or comment. 

---+++ Brazil
---+++ Chile
---+++ Colombia


---++ Working plan

This is the most important section of this wiki. Here we will have the definition of future steps. In particular those related collaboration between OSG and !LatinGrid.

---++ Topics to discuss
This is a quite random, unsorted and incomplete list of questions to motivate discussion. 
Please add any comment you want for each topic, and questions not already included in that list you think should be. 
---+++ Name for the Grid Infrastructure?
For the moment, let's call it !LatinGrid.
---+++ is the !LatinGrid model that every site supports every VO or it is a site policy? Could the answer affects to the model and its deployment?
---+++ Brazil and Chile have already national CAs? Do every country need one or !LatinGrid can survive using one of these two?
---+++ Does !LatinGrid want to create some kind of VOs registry service?
---+++ Does !LatinGrid want to have some central service like VDT where their VOs allocate their software?
---+++ Does !LatinGrid want to have some central service like GOC? Just one ore many (one per country)? Which services would it provide for?
---+++ Does the multiplicity of science make more appealing virtualization?  Grid Computing or Cloud Computing?
---+++ Does !LatinGrid want to follow the OSG model where sites are 100% independent or a model 'French like' where every site has the same configuration for some services (SE, local batch system...) is more reliable and efficient? 
---+++ Does !LatinGrid want to implement some Resource Information service? If yes, which one: BDII, !ReSS, ...?
---+++ Does !LatinGrid prefer to leave VOs to handle the job management or is going to provide for a default generic tool? If so, which one?
---+++ Does !LatinGrid prefer to leave VOs to handle the data management or is going to provide for a default generic tool? If so, which one? 
---+++ Is interesting for !LatinGrid to enhance the feeling of community to engage people, institutions, research groups, funding agencies,....? If yes, how? Could be interesting to have a centralized list of VOs, sites, and users? Their own online maganize 'a la iSGTW'? Usage of social networks? An outreach program?
---+++ Could be interesting for !LatinGrid to have an "engagement program" like we have in OSG?
---+++ And what about a "toy VO" like OSGEDU or Engage?
---+++ Will some sites provide for ITB resources for validation?
---+++ What about a "campfire" like in OSG where expert are online to solve doubts from people installing/administrating sites?
---+++ A centralized document service?
---+++ Can the national policies for each country be a show stopper? If yes, how to deal with them?
---+++ Is !LatinGrid the junction of a set of national Grids, or it is a global project with its own identity?
---+++ Should the central services (like GOC, VDT...) be allocated on a single place and stay there forever or distributed among the countries?  If a fixed place, which one?
---+++ Is a good idea for !LatinGrid to make use, when possible, of open source tools in order to avoid work already done or !LatinGrid prefers to develop its own tools and/or use proprietary tools? In case of accepting using open source tools, will !LatinGrid release as open source all product it develops?
---+++ Will be the software of the experiments pre-installed?
---+++ Will be the hard drives used to store data?
---+++ There will be staff to give long-term support? And for 24/7 services?
---+++ Could be interesting for the future of !LatinGrid to have its own research program, funding master students, !PhD program, etc?
---+++ How !LatinGrid and OSG can collaborate?
What OSG can offer is: training courses,  
hosting some mailing list, 
allow collaborators to join the OSG meetings (VOs meetings, sites meetings, integration meetings...) so they can get the feeling of what we do and how... 

Resource sharing?
