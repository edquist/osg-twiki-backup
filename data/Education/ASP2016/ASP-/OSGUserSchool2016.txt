---+ OSG User School 2016

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, 25–29 July, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool16Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff. Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School.
