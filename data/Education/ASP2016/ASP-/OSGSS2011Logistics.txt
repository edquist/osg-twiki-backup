---++ Important Note for Non-US Citizens

If you are not a U.S. citizen, we must make photocopies of certain documents to pay for your travel costs. At minimum, you must bring:

   * Passport
   * U.S. visa
   * Form I-94

Additionally, if you have an *F-1 (Student)* visa, we need Form I-20 as well; if you have a *J-1 (Visitor)* visa, we need Form DS-2019.

Please bring all required documents to the first session, Monday, June 27. One of the School staff will make copies of the documents and return them to you immediately.

---++ Taxis from the airport to the Lowell Center

Please read our [[OSGSS2011Taxis][information on taking a taxi from the airport to the Lowell Center]]. We are asking you to share taxis to reduce our costs. 

---++ Hotel 

Most out-of-town participants are staying at the [[http://conferencing.uwex.edu/lodging.cfm][Lowell Center]], [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=610%20Langdon%20Street%2C%20madison%2C%20wi][610 Langdon Street, Madison, WI]].

---++ Welcome Dinner

On Sunday evening, we are hosting a group dinner at 6:30 p.m. at [[http://www.foodspot.com/Clients/WI/Madison/TuttoPastaTrattoria/default.aspx?accid=17593][Tutto Pasta Trattoria]], [[http://maps.google.com/maps?q=305+state+street,+madison,+wi&hl=en&z=16][305 State Street]]

If you arrive in time, Tim Cartwright and Alain Roy ([[http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~roy/pictures/FermiPhotoShoot/fullshot.jpg][Picture of Alain]]) will meet you (and other students) in the lobby of the Lowell Center. Then, at 6:20 p.m. or so, the entire assembled group will walk together to the restaurant.

---++ School 

---+++ Location

The school will be held in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/location.html][Computer Sciences Department]], located at [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1210%20West%20Dayton.%2C%20Madison%2C%20Wisconsin][1210 West Dayton St., Madison, WI, 53706]]. 

Walking directions from the Lowell Center: %RED%*UPDATE*%ENDCOLOR%
   * Walk west (left) out the front door of the Doubletree Hotel. You'll be going down Johnson Street.
   * If you want, get a fancy coffee at [[http://www.coffeebytes.net/index.php][Coffee Bytes]] (one block North in [[http://www.usquaremadison.com/][University Square]]) or at the !Jo2Go in [[http://www.grandcentralmadison.com/][GrandCentral apartments]]. !Jo2Go makes a great espresso.
   * Turn left on Charter Street. Walk one block to Dayton St.
   * Turn right onto Dayton St. The CS building is the big building with glass doors on your right, just past the Subway shop. 

School sessions and breakfasts are held in *Room 1240*:

   * Enter the CS building through the glass doors on Dayton Street
   * Turn left, and go through two sets of double doors
   * Walk down the hallway just a bit, 1240 is up the ramp or a few stairs to the right

Lunches on Monday and Thursday will be catered in the Computer Sciences building, in a different room: *Room 2310*. We will guide students to the lunch room on the first day.

Lunches on Tuesday and Wednesday will be held at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, a very new and beautiful building located just two minutes from the Computer Sciences building. We will guide students there and back. We hope to arrange a brief tour of the building on one of those days.

The Computer Sciences building is a bit confusing — we will post signs to help you find your way. You can always just ask people for directions if you get lost.

---++ Hours & Meals

The school is 8:00 to 5:00 or 5:30, Monday through Thursday. A [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Education/OSGSS2011Schedule][detailed schedule]] is available.

%RED%*UPDATE*%ENDCOLOR% We will provide breakfast and lunch, Monday - Thursday. We will provide group dinners on Sunday and Thursday. 

---++ Reimbursements

%RED%*UPDATE*%ENDCOLOR%

Almost all of your expenses are prepaid. There are two important things to know:

   1. We have prepaid your hotel. However, the hotel requires you to provide your credit card when you check in. This will be used for any extra expenses you incur. For instance, we won't be paying for your movies or other minor expenses.
   1. You will be on your own for dinners Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. You'll need to apply for a reimbursement yourself. To get your money back, you'll need to do three things.
      1. Keep receipts for your meals. You cannot exceed %RED%$NN%ENDCOLOR%/day. We cannot pay for alcohol, just food.
      1. Fill out reimbursement form *TBD*
      1. Print it, sign it, and mail it with a your receipts and a nice note to our reimbursement experts saying you came to the school as well as thanking them for their hard work. Mail it no later than *DATE* to: *TBD*

---++ Fun

%RED%*UPDATE*%ENDCOLOR%

   * [[http://www.union.wisc.edu/][Memorial Union]] is a great place to hang out, just a couple blocks from the Lowell Center. Many people like to get a drink and relax on the Terrace, which looks out over [[http://www.soils.wisc.edu/asig/webcam.html][Lake Monona]]. 
   * [[http://www.explorewisconsin.com/communitypages/state_st.asp][State Street]] is very close. It's a pedestrian-only street with tons of great businesses--restaurants, shops, bars, and more. 
   * Catch a movie at [[http://www.orpheumtheatre.net/][the Orpheum Theatre]].
   * Check out [[http://www.overturecenter.com/][The Overture Center for the Arts]].
