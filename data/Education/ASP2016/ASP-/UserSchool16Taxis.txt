---+ Taxis and Travel within Madison

We will help coordinate travel within Madison for those who do not have their own transportation.

---++ Taxis to/from Madison Airport

The Best Western hotel can provide free shuttle service from and back to the Madison airport, but there are limited seats available. If students need other transportation, we may be able to help with that as well. We will plan all travel from/to the airport after all students have finished their air travel plans.

---++ Travel on Campus

It is easy to walk to most places in and around the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus, and the Best Western hotel is not too far of a walk from the Computer Sciences building. For students who do not wish to walk, the Best Western has a shuttle that can be used to transport students between the hotel and the School (and other places).

Many [[http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/][Madison Metro]] buses stop on the Capitol Square and pass through the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus. Bus fare is $2.00, and transfers may be requested for free.

Also, there are several good taxi companies in Madison, including [[http://www.greencabofmadison.com/ Green Cab]], [[http://www.badgercab.com/ Badger Cab]] and [[http://www.unioncab.com/ Union Cab]].  Cabs are readily available in Madison, and the companies also take reservations. We will not reimburse students for taxi costs within the downtown Madison area or for personal trips.

---++ Madison Metro city bus service

The official [[http://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/schedules/][Madison Metro Bus page]] provides route maps and times for all Madison buses. Google Maps and the Wisconsin phone app also do a good job. Several bus lines run within a couple of blocks of the Best Western and Computer Sciences, and the buses are a great way to get around town when walking or if using the hotel shuttle is not an option.
