---++ Introduction
   * See the main workshop [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2832][agenda]] in Indico system
   * *Technical reference material* needed for the workshop is located [[ReleaseDocumentation.GridColombiaWorkshop2009][here]]

---++ Background Information
---+++ Program overview
This workshop is the second part in a three phase program supporting the launch of Grid Colombia.
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/2009-10-gc-over.ppt][2009-10-gc-over.ppt]]: *Workshop preview presentation*, 10/14/09
   * *Phase I:* preparations in advance of the in-person workshop
      * Overview presentation on October 9 (web conference)
      * Student and systems administrator background preparations 
      * Institutional organizational activities
   * *Phase II:* workshop on scientific computing on Grids and Grid prototype building (this workshop)
   * *Phase III:* deployment of production facilities across multiple sites in Colombia

Phase II will take place over two weeks and will cover scientific computing on distributed, Grid-based platforms as well as Grid infrastructure building.  The workshops will be held at [[http://www.javeriana.edu.co/puj/english/][Universidad Javeriana]], Bogota, Colombia.  There will be a follow-on workshop focusing on production facilities at all of the participating sites as part of the Grid Colombia overall program of work.

   * October 20-23, 2009: Scientific Computing on Grids: _Introductory Grid Computing Overviews and User Capabilities_
   * October 26-30, 2009: Building Grid Infrastructure: _Towards a National Colombian Science Grid_  
  
Goals of this workshop are to:

   * Introduce grid computing concepts from an end-user's perspective
   * Provide hands-on tutorials for end-user client tools
   * Introduce grid infrastructure building principles
   * Provide hands-on tutorials for compute and storage element installation
