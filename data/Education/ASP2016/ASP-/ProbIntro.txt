This exercise introduces the physics example code, taken from <nop>QuarkNet. You will run some of the code by hand to analyse data and plot it on a graph. In later exercises, you will run the same code but in other ways, taking advantage of VDS.

The <nolp>QuarkNet code is written in PERL and kept in the =/opt/<nop>QuarkCode/= directory.

The data files which will be analysed have been collected from cosmic ray detectors at various sites around the US. Some of that is available in the =Data/= subdirectory.

<pre class="screen">
$ <span class="in">ls /opt/vdltut/Data/</span>
<span class="out">180
$ <b>ls /opt/vdltut/Data/ </b>
180
180.2004.0819.0.raw
180.2004.0819.0.raw.meta
180.2004.0819.1.raw
180.2004.0819.1.raw.meta
[...]
</pre>

The commands to run are in the =/opt/vdltut/PROBINTRO/= subdirectory, in a shell script called =manual.sh=. You can run the whole analysis by executing that shell script.

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir ~/PROBINTRO </b>
$ <b>cd ~/PROBINTRO </b>
</pre>

</pre>

The output graph is in =plot.png=. In addition, several intermediate files have been created &emdash; each step in the analysis created intermediate files that were then used by later steps.

To view the plot, you can scp plot.png to your local machine and view it:

%IMPORTANT% Type this on your local laptop, not on one of the gridlab servers!

$ <b>scp train99@gridlab1:PROBINTRO/plot.png . </b>
$ <b>open plot.png </b>
