---+ Wednesday Exercise 5.2: Seeing differences in the OSG

The goal of this exercise is to submit jobs and see the differences between locally running jobs and jobs running out in the OSG.

---++ Exploring Differences in Software

We've talked about how the availability of software can vary among the available resources in the OSG. Here's a simple shell script that will output the location of matlab and the versions of the OS, python, and cmake:

<pre class='file'>#!/bin/sh

echo "Matlab Location: `which matlab`"
echo "OS Version: `cat /etc/redhat-release`"
echo "Python Version: `python --version 2>&1 | awk '{print $2'}'`"
echo "cmake Version: `cmake --version | awk 'NR==1 {print $3}'`"
</pre>

   1. Save the above text to a file named =versions.sh=
   1. Create a submit file that runs the above code ten times on the local cluster (make sure to separate your output!)
   1. Test your submit file — do you get output?
   1. Edit the submit file so that it submits its jobs to the OSG
   1. Change the names of the output files so that your previous results are not overwritten
   1. Submit your jobs and wait for them to complete

What's the variance of versions between the two different runs?
