---++ Using scripting languages

<div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em;">
---+++ Objective of this exercise
The objective of this exercise is to demonstrate that you can submit jobs to Condor in any language, including scripting languages.
</div>

At this point, you might be asking yourself, "This is all well and good, but I don't write programs in C. Can I use other languages?" Absolutely.

Let's assume you like to write program in Bourne shell. Make sure your program begins with =#!/bin/sh=, and you're good to go. Try out this example:

<pre style="margin-left:4em" class="screen">
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: simple.sh sleep-time integer"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Thinking really hard for $1 seconds.."
sleep $1
answer=$(( $2 * 2 ))
echo "We calculated $answer."
exit 0
</pre>

Can you write a submit file to run this job? This should be easy--the script is your _Executable_, not "/bin/sh". You may also want to change the name of your submit.log, submit.out, and submit.err in your =submit= file to be sure they are not written over when you run this submission. 

---++ Challenge
Rewrite this script in Perl or Python (if you're comfortable with one of those languages). Does it still work for you?


---++ Onward...

Excellent! You made it! [[HTCReviewCondorFiles][Click here to continue on to part two!]]
