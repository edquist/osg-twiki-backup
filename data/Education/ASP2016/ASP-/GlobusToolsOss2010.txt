---+ Using the Globus Tools

We'll spend just a bit of time on the Globus command-line tools so you are aware that they exist.  

---+ Submitting jobs with =globus-job-run=

The =globus-job-run= command line utility allows one to submit jobs directly to a Globus gatekeeper.  To use this, you need to know three things:
   * Remote gatekeeper hostname
   * Port
   * Jobmanager (the name of the service on the gatekeeper you will be using).

Let's start running on =osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu= with the default port and the default jobmanager.  Log into =vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu= and create your proxy if you haven't yet.

<pre class="screen">
[bbockelm@vdt-itb ~]$ %BLUE%globus-job-run osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu:/jobmanager /usr/bin/whoami%ENDCOLOR%
osgedu
[bbockelm@vdt-itb ~]$ %BLUE%globus-job-run osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu:/jobmanager /bin/hostname%ENDCOLOR%
osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu
</pre>

The output of the command line is the output of the executable running on the remote host.  As you can see, we were executing as the =osgedu= user and on the =osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu= host.
