---+ Dealing with Proxies

---++ About This Document
This document contains the initial exercises related to proxy management.  After completing these exercises, you should understand:
   * The parts of your certificate:
      * Certificate file
      * Key file
      * Certificate Authority
      * Distinguished Name and Common Name
   * Proxy management
      * Grid and VOMS proxies
      * Creating and destroying proxies
   * Testing your proxy against a remote Globus GT2 endpoint

---++ Exploring your Certificate

Your x509 certificate is your "passport for the grid", so it's worth exploring different aspects of it a bit.

To do this, we will utilize two command line tools:
   * =openssl=, which typically comes with the operating system.
   * =grid-cert-info=, which ships with your OSG client install.

---+++ Certificate Files

---+++ The Certificate Authority
Just like a passport, it's important to know who issued and signed your certificate.  The certificate authority will verify your identity, sign your certificate request, and sites will trust the identity of the holder of the certificate.

---+++ Dumping the contents of the certificate 

---+++ Distinguished and Common Names

---++ Proxies

---+++ Creating VOMS and Grid Proxies

VOMS proxy:
<pre style="margin-left:4em">
% voms-proxy-init -voms osgedu
Enter GRID pass phrase:
