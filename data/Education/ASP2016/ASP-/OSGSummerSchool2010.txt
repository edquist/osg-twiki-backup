---+ OSG Summer School 2010

---++ Purpose

The school is targeted at people who wish to learn how to use OSG either to submit their own scientific applications or to build systems to submit applications to OSG. Specifically, we hope that after the school, the students will be able to:

*%RED% These are tentative and may change! %ENDCOLOR%*

   1. Describe the basic elements and architecture of a distributed computing system 
   1. Use basic distributed computing tools to run jobs and manage data 
   1. Select reasonable tools and methods to solve scientific computing problems using distributed computing
   1. Outline the role of distributed computing, its history, current state and issues, and hopes for the future 
   1. Identify resources for support, further study, and development opportunities in distributed computing

The school will be fueled by lots of hands-on exercises (we intend for you to run _lots_ of jobs) and interactions with many people from the experienced and knowledgeable OSG staff.

We are primarily targeting graduate students, but any qualified and interested applicant is acceptable.

The school is associated with the !TeraGrid Conference student program. We expect to accept about 15 students for the OSG Summer School, and they will also attend the !TeraGrid Conference as part of their student program.
