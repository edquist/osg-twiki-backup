---+ 2014 OSG User School - Send Igor your public ssh key

The Tuesday exercises will run on a node that only accepts [[http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html][SSH public key mechanism]] for authentication.

Please send your public ssh key (as an attachment), alongside your account name, to Igor at [[mailto:isfiligoi_at_ucsd.edu][isfiligoi@ucsd.edu]] by Monday evening, so your accounts can be activated in time.

---++ Where to find the ssh public key

If you use Linux or OS&nbsp;X, your public ssh key will be in a file named
<pre class="screen">
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre>

If you don't have that file yet, see instructions below on how to create it.

If you use Windows, it depends which ssh client you use.
If you need help, please ask any of the available support staff in the room.

---++ How to create an ssh key on Linux or OS&nbsp;X

Create the ~/.ssh directory, if it does not exist yet:
<pre class="screen">
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod go-rwx ~/.ssh
</pre>

Use ssh-keygen to create the actual file:
<pre class="screen">
ssh-keygen -t rsa
</pre>
You should provide a password to encrypt the private key. <br>
*Note:* There is no way to reset the password, so make sure you pick a password you can remember.
