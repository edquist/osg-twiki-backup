Education, Training and Outreach. She is based at the Computation
Institute, University of Chicago and she is also a member in the
Distributed Systems Lab at the Argonne National Laboratory. She received
her PhD in Computer Science from University of Iowa in 2006 in the area of
distributed systems and held the position of Visiting Assistant Professor
in the Computer Science department at St. Cloud State University,
Minnesota for one year. Her research interests include grid computing,
peer-to-peer systems, agents and self-stabilizing systems. Her recent
focus is on promoting grid computing through a series of educational
events that target undergraduate and graduate students and faculty,
researchers, highschool teachers and other professionals.
