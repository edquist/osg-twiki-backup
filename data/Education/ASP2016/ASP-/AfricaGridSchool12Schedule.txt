> Day 1: Introduction to high-throughput computing in a local environment with Condor.
> Day 2: Moving to the grid, including glideins
> Day 3: Storage and science workflows
>
> I suggest leveraging the 2012 OSG User School (in development now, will happen the last week of June), as much as possible. It's a four-day school and we only have three-days for our school, so it's not going to be identical. But we can re-use many of the materials. This is the third year the school has run, so it's a pretty solid base for us.

> Here's a possible agenda. I'm sure we can and should tweak it, but I think it's a reasonable stake in the ground.
