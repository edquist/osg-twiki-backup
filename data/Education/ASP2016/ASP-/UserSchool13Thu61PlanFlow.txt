---+ Monday Exercise 6.1: Plan an Example Workflow

Your goal is to plan out Joe’s workflow based upon small-scale jobs (first, 30-minute session) and, later, to write a full-scale DAG to actually run his workflow in production (second, 90-minute session). Please make sure to first read the Background Information about Joe’s computing work. You will not need to modify Joe’s tar scripts, and will only need to modify the submit files as directly instructed. It is advisable that you split up the work within your group in order to be time-efficient.

---++ 1) Log in to osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu and enter the following commands to copy and untar Joe’s job ingredients.
