                Here a description of the program. Something like...
                <br><br>
                Sites in the Open Science Grid have been running real operations for a few years, 
                and therefore their system administration members are fully trained in the installation and maintenance of grid middleware and services in a production environment.
                At the same time, the OSG Grid Operation Center (GOC) has also been providing reliable support services. 
                Maybe some numbers, like the number of sites, number of jobs, data managed, etc. ?
                <br><br>
                OSG offers the opportunity for foreign system administrators to spend some time on some OSG facilities, as well as the Grid Operation Center (GOC).
                Visitors will have the opportunity to work for a period of time on a production environment and get the expertise to operate the facilities in their home institutions.
                This program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students working as system administrators in Grid sites for their National Grid Infrastructures.  
                Students participating in this program will be able to return to their local institutions with new skills ready to be used in their day to day activities. 
                <br><br>
                OSG staffs members will be in contact with both the visitors and their supervisor in the hosting institution to ensure the goals are being accomplished, 
                and the visitor is getting the expected training and orientation.
