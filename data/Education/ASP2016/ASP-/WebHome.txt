---+ GRID Summer Workshop


%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++ Welcome!
Welcome to the web presence for GRID Summer Workshop 2005. [[http://cgwa.phys.utb.edu/index.php][The Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy]] (CGWA), the [[http://www.griphyn.org/][Grid Physics Network]] (!GriPhyN), [[http://www.grids-center.org/][GRIDS Center]] and the [[http://ivdgl.org][International Virtual Data Grid Laboratory]] (iVDGL) present a one-week intensive Summer Workshop program in grid computing and its application in scientific data analysis. More information on the Grid Summer Workshop can be found on the home page at [[http://cgwa.phys.utb.edu/Events/Summer2005/summergridws2005.php][http://cgwa.phys.utb.edu/Events/Summer2005/summergridws2005.php]].
---++ Aim and Purpose
The aim of the workshop is to give the students a basic foundation in distributed computing, and valuable hands-on training in computing techniques. The workshop introduces essential skills that will be needed by students in the natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.

Participants will work with some of the world's leading experts in grid computing, through a blend of lectures, discussions and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources. 

---++ Location
The workshop will be held July 11 - 15 at the University of Texas facility on [[http://www.sopadre.com/][South Padre Island]], a resort located on the Gulf of Mexico, twenty miles from downtown Brownsville, Texas.

---++Schedule
Each day of the workshop will include two moderately short lectures (approximately 1:15), each followed by longer hands-on time (approximately 2:30). Staff composed of lecturers and assistants will be available during assistance sessions and hands-on sessions. Each day of the workshop will feature hands-on collaboration in a team environment.

---++Scholarships
More information to come.

---++Technology
Examples and training will utilize [[http://www.ivdgl.org/grid2003/][Grid3]], [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][Open Science Grid]] and a small, in-house "micro Grid" running standard Grid software.
