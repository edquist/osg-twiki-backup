   * Tim: Draft list of invited Showcase speakers
   * PAs: Invite speakers and confirm until slots are filled
   * PAs: Confirm again about two weeks out
   * PAs: Ask about technology needs: computer, projection, microphone, etc.

---++ Other Tasks

   * *Instructors* Select, invite, and arrange travel for instructors, including HTC Showcase ones. Generally, this task occurs after the high-level curriculum has been designed and before it gets too late for (a) travel arrangements, and (b) content development. It is probably a good idea to make initial contact with key instructors about 3 months out, and aim to settle the core instructor list at 6–8 weeks out. Much later than that, and instructors will be hard to schedule, travel will be expensive, and content development will be rushed. For each remote instructor, offer to arrange and pay for travel (airfare, rental car, mileage, parking) and hotel. Invite all instructors to participate in as much of the schedule as they like, especially the social events. Active remote collaborators may have other activities that they can perform locally, so they may easily fill the whole week with events, School and otherwise. Be sure to contact HTC Showcase invitees early, to get on their schedules; assuming the School is during the academic summertime, it would not hurt to make initial inquiries before the spring semester is out.

   * *Ground Transportation* Most students will arrive at the airport and will need transportation to the School hotel (or other venue, depending on timing). Look for groups of students arriving on the same flight or on closely spaced arrivals, and help them meet each other and share transportation. If using taxis, see if any groups are large enough to warrant a minivan, shuttle bus, or other special vehicle. Make backup plans for when flights arrival early or late, and be sure that students have a clear means of communicating transportation changes _en route_.

   * *Content Development* Ask content providers for an initial outline and then a draft set of materials. Try to get all outlines together and distribute to other instructors (as appropriate). An outline should document goals, objectives, major points, methodology used, and timing for each subsection of content; it sounds like a lot of detail, but each item can be just a single line, and a full day’s plan easily fits in a page or two. Check the outlines for a good mix of lecture and interactive segments, for appropriate content, and for gaps and overlap with other instructors’ materials. Draft materials should show the full span of the session, but may have small details missing. Check the drafts for content, style, and completeness. Make sure the hands-on portions are drafted as well, and blend well with other materials. Ideally, each section of the curriculum has extra, self-directed hands-on exercises for those students who finish the core curriculum quickly.

---++ Mentoring Plan

For the 2011 School, we have some new ideas for making the Mentoring system a bit more robust:

   * Send a survey to students at 3, 6, and 12 months after the School. Ask students about: contact with mentor and community at large; progress on HTC projects; open questions.
   * Have one follow-up call with students and mentors, maybe right after the 3-month survey. Ask how things are going and how to improve.
   * Require contact reports from mentors every two months. Ask about: number of contacts, reason(s) for lack of contact if so, and a basic progress update.

---++ Follow-Up Events

Students who continue to be involved in HTC work should be invited to participate in other events:

   * *OSG All-Hands Meeting* Find out the !AHM schedule well in advance (3–4 months), plan how to integrate students into event with organizers, identify strong candidates, find budget for travel, invite students, etc.
   * *Condor Week* Similar process, mostly for students working in/with Condor itself. Consider inviting to present, or set up a poster session and make sure attendees are driven toward it.

---++ Extra Info for planning
Additional details that can be useful for planning purposes

---+++ Hotels

   * Because the money for the School comes from a federal grant, we are tied to the state rates for lodging (and meals, see below). The state rate is $70/night/person. Most of the hotels in the area have state rate rooms available, but it can be difficult finding all the rooms at one place. In 2012, we used Union South. In 2011, we used the Lowell Center. In 2010, we used the Doubletree.
You'll want to book hotel rooms for the entire week of the conference, checking in the day before it starts and checking out the day after (ie. if the conference is June 24-27, you would have the students check in on June 23 and check out June 28.
   * You'll want to book the block way in advance (in fact - the minute you have dates, you should try to get the hotel rooms locked in). Make sure they understand that we (ie. Condor/CHTC) will be paying for the block and that individual students will not be paying for there room (unless there are other circumstances which could necessitate this). Usually, there will be a contract to sign.
There's a weird side note to this: you need to have each person billed to the department credit card separately. We cannot charge over $5000 to the credit card, and even separating the charges a little bit can still cause problems. Union South has agreed to this for 2012, but I had problems with it for the past two years. Some of the hotels don't want to do it, but we need to do this to prevent auditing issues.

---+++ Location of conference

   * For the conference, we need a room available all day, for 4 days, usually Monday-Thursday. We have been having the conference in Computer Sciences (2010: 4310; 2011: 1240; 2012: 1240).
We would like to have it not in Union South, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed first:
People: every year we have been expanding the School more and more (it was 17 students in 2010, 25 students in 2011, 30 students in 2012). It has become more of an issue dealing with space. 1240 is a big lecture hall so it will fit plenty of people.
   * Union South: While we get discounts to Union South and we rent the space for free, we still need to pay for AV charges, and that is not budgeted. So unless we a) have our own AV system we can use (which I don't think we can do) or b) figure out how to get it for free or c) budget for AV, we cannot have the event at Union South
Teaching Labs @ WID: We can use the Teaching Labs, but the biggest problem is availability. It fills up very quickly, and we've never been able to make it work (so far). The other issue is that there would probably be a fee for using the space, but that's not positive. They have changed their rules a bunch (as they work through the kinks from opening the building). However, the teaching labs are a great space, and if we can use it for free (ie. without having to pay for AV or space fees), then we should use it if it's available. I think their capacity is around 40 people.
Other possible locations are Memorial Union, the Pyle Center and the Lowell Center and Fluno.

---+++ Meals

   * Menus: The state rate for meals (as of 1/1/2012) is $8 (breakfast), $9 (lunch), $17 (dinner). Obviously, from where we order depends on where the event is, but here are some ideas based on what we've done in the past.
   * Breakfast/Lunch: If the event is in a non-Union location, (WID or CS for example) we can order catering from UW-Housing. They are very nice, and they've always given us fantastic service. The contact is Joe Mehring, and they are always happy to do service with us. I usually contact them 3 months before to verify that they are available (mid-March for conference at the end of June).
If the event is at Union South, you will need to cater through Union South. However, don't order from Union South if the event is in CS or WID. There's a $30 ($35?) delivery fee for each delivery outside Union South. (ie. $60/day or $70/day for our food. We cannot afford that and it is ridiculous.)
If the event is at WID in the teaching labs, we can do catering from UW-Housing. As long as the event is not on the 1st floor, we do not have to use WID catering.
   * WID Lunch: Every year, we try to have one or two lunches at WID, catered by WID. In order to do so, we need to get extra funds from Miron (usually through the OSG grant) since most of their lunches are not at the state rates. In addition to the lunch, there is usually a tour of WID following the lunch.
   * Dinners: 
      * For three nights (usually Mon, Tues, Wed), the students are on their own for dinner, but we do reimburse them for the expenses. 
      * We have two dinners that we do with the entire group, on the day before the conference (usually Sunday), and on the last day of the conference (usually Thursday). It is getting difficult to find a good place to have these dinners (since they are going to be about 40 people starting in 2012). Some suggestions (which I am looking into for 2012) are: Union South, Pyle, Lowell, Memorial Union. We would like to have the Sunday dinner at Union South and then the Thursday dinner on the second floor terrace outside at Memorial Union.

---+++ Miscellaneous

   * Email addresses: You'll need to set up an email address to disseminate information. We create one every year, and the instructions are here: Creating the Gridschool Info Email Address
In 2011, the list was created on February 27.
   * Applicants/Attendees (and their issues): Dealing with the applicants and the attendees can be frustrating at times because of all the unforeseen issues that come up. Patience, politeness, and kindness are necessary when dealing with all the issues and questions. We had around 95 applicants for the 2011 school so we always need a way to organize the applicants and make sure nothing is dropped. Our solution has been to create a spreadsheet on Google Docs (through UW-Madison) which details name, application date, letter of recommendation send date, etc.
   * Preparing the application: In the two weeks to a week before the application goes live, whatever HTCondor Staff is in charge of event will edit the application questions for any number of issues (ie. maybe they want to ask different technical questions, or maybe we want to add a logistical question that we missed the previous year, or maybe we wanted to leave out a question). Once s/he has edited the application, a few people will submit proxy applications to make sure it works.
   * Posting the Application: The application gets posted around the beginning of March for a conference that is held at the end of June. There is a one month period where the application is live. For 2012, applications were posted on March 5 and are due March 30. The program committee (for 2012 - Alain and Tim) get 2 weeks to review the applications and make their decisions. For 2012, the notification date is April 16.
   * Advertising: Once the application for the OSG User School goes live (in 2011 it was on Monday, March 5), we need to advertise to various locations so people will apply to attend. We have three groups which we target, and hopefully they disseminate the information (like we ask them to) so we can get a wide variety of good applicants.

---+++ Preparing for Attendance

   * In order to be reimbursed for the expenses that they will be accruing during the conference (food, taxi), the students must be US citizens or have current home country passport and US visa. As will be detailed below, you will need to photocopy their passport and visa for the reimbursement process. We are currently working on when we will be asking the students for their information. Obviously, it is not a requirement for attendance, but if they want to be reimbursed at all for their hotel, all food, any transportation, they must have a current visa and passport from time of application to the conclusion of the school.
Most likely, we will ask the students for their visa information after they are accepted to the school. It will come in a separate email, and we will ask for pdfs of the passport and visa right away so that it does not become an issue later.
3. Implementing the conference
Like other conferences you (the PA) will plan, you should plan to be available and working for the majority of the conference. You will want to be on hand for any problems that may arise. Also, you will benefit from the availability of food. You probably won't be needed the entire time, but it's good to have a presence because you will have been dealing with the attendees the most, and usually they enjoy seeing you there. Also, Miron likes to see you there.
Often during the conference, I will bring my computer down to the room and do work there during the talks. This allows you to maximize your time, so that you aren't falling behind on things like travel, but it also allows you to have a presence at the school that has proved to be invaluable. Students often have questions about reimbursements or random logistics, and if you are right there, ready and willing to answer those questions, it looks good for us. Again, Miron likes this kind of visibility. Obviously, you are not being forced to work overtime, or anything beyond the hours that you are scheduled to work each week.
Review sheets

In my opinion, one of the best aspects of doing conferences for Condor is that everyone wants to improve for the next year. Instead of being happy with just the status quo, there is a constant effort to improve the experience for the attendees. Therefore, after every session, we have review sheets where the students are asked several questions about the session. We have examples from previous years.
Collecting receipts

Collecting any other info

---+++ Set-up/Loose Ends

One of the things to watch out for are any technical issues with the AV, and making sure someone comes to fix it if the Condor Staff cannot. Someone (usually the PA) needs to be available in the morning to open the conference room (if in CS) to let in the catering people so they can set up breakfast. The pre-determined time should be set up with whomever is catering the breakfasts. If the PA is not available, then someone else needs to be there (preferable Alain or Tim since they are also organizing things). In CS1240, there are tables and chairs that should be set up on the floor of the conference room as space for people to eat and for people to do extra exercises during the lectures. This has been wildly successful (surprisingly so), so we like to have this extra space for use. If in the future we have the school at another location, this is something to keep in mind. It's great to have an extra space for people to be "social". At the end of the day, there needs to be someone who closes up the conference room and make sure it's locked for the night. Whoever takes the key will be the one to open up the room the next morning.
If there is any point during the day when the entire room is empty, one of two things needs to happen: The doors to the conference room need to be totally closed and locked. We will have everyone leave their stuff there, and if someone steals the stuff, that's bad. Someone needs to stay in the room with the stuff to watch out for it (usually the PA). It's often better to just lock up the room. The AV in CS1240 can be tricky, but the Condor staff can set it up. 
If the conference is in another location, you will need to coordinate with the AV staff at the location to make sure everything is working properly. Also, you'll need to know how to contact them in case anything gets messed up (which it probably will - Murphy's Law).
