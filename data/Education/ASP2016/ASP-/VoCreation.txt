---+ Possible questions: 

[1] how do I create a VO? Do I need some paperwork? Do I need to have some documents with rules and norms? Where can I found a template?

[2] Where do I register it? Am I allowed to register my VO as an OSG VO if my country has not yet the infrastructure? Will then the "Americans" ask me for something as a compensation?

[3] How do I advertise my VO? Which is the necessary amount of information required to advertise a VO (VOMS url, main project URL...)?

[4] How do I install a VOMS server? Where? VOMS server Administration?

[5] GUMS ?

[6] How do I manage security?

[7] How do I gridify my application? Which part will be pre-installed and which part is sent along with the jobs? How do I pre-install that software in the sites?

[8] How do I handle my data?

[9] Do I need a site to create a VO, or I can create a VO that just uses opportunistic resources?

[10] How do I contact sites, in my country or different one, to ask them to give support to my VO? How do I negotiate quotas and priorities? Is there a set of rules for this negotiations?

[11] If I am a site, how do I setup those rules?

[12] How do I quote the Grid Infrastructure in my papers? How can I account the benefits, in term of cost saved thanks to the Grid?

[13] As a NGI level, how do we develop an Engagement program?

 -- For [1]

                http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Getting_Started_with_OSG/Form_New_VO
 
 -- For [2] and [3], I am looking for any link about how to register a new VO in OIM.
 I also sent an email to Rob Quick asking about documentation on the process to request GOC to include the new VO in the GOC templates,
 but I didn't get any answer from him yet.

 -- For [4] and [5]:

 -- For [7], gridification, I sent an email to Alain Roy and Zachary Miller.
 I only heard from Alain saying the only info he has is the slides from the Madison Schools and Sao Paulo School.
 I just sent another email to Zach asking for the slides from the lectures in Sao Paulo:
        - Turning science problems into HTC jobs
        - Decomposing and running large jobs
 
 On the VO software installation, I got this link
 
                https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/LocalStorageConfiguration#OSG_APP
 
 and these notes:
 
        """<br>
        This is really up to the VO, I think. Some VOs send wrapper scripts as job to OSG sites, then
        transfer and install the other related software on the local disk on worker nodes; most VOs pre-install
        most part of the VO software, like runtime libraries and other supporting tools under OSG_APP/ area,
        and only send a "master" script, with other controlling parameters, as jobs to the sites. Some VOs' jobs
        are very simple to start with, so they can pack everything in a job and transfer input files on a per job basis.
 
        To do pre-installation, below are the recommended steps:
 
        1) create a VO software manager role in VOMS, and do software installation under this role, no matter whose cert is used;

        2) create a vo specific subdir under OSG_APP/ area

        3) send grid jobs, using globus clients or condor-g, to remote site, and run the installation job from worker nodes

        4) The job payload can download and/or compile the codes once it lands on the worker node; after it's done, add an
           entry to OSG_APP/etc/grid3-locations.txt, so that the software info can be published to BDII

        5) OSG_APP/etc/grid3-locations.txt is writable by all VOs, and shared as well. So be sure not to wipe out existing info in
           that file, and keep the file permission as is after modification.

        6) VO software manager should manage the installed software on the grid, clean up old ones if not needed.

 -- For [11], I asked Marco Mambelli about implementation of policies, quotas, etc at the site level, for each type of local batch system.
 The answer was:
 
        """<br>
        there is no document with sites configurations documenting how to implement the different policies.
        Some work in that direction was made by the SVOPME SBIR with Tech-X:
 
        https://ice.txcorp.com/trac/svopme/wiki/WikiStart
        <br>"""
 
 -- For [12], I think we can analyze the content of this paper and get from it some lessons on how to quantify benefits:
 
        http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=813
 
 -- For [13], the answer I got from John McGee was
 
        """<br>
        not directly related, but possibly useful:

The steps that we following until now are:
-	Diego like Grid Colombia sys-admin create the GCBIO in the GUMS.
-	In Universidad de los Andes design a specials steps to obtain a
certificate for below to GRID Colombia and be member of the GCBIO

-	Then we select who sites assign to this VO.

o	Universidad Autónoma ce
o	Universidad de Caldas ce

-	Diego Created the steps to register ce  certificates in the VOMS.

I think that we need a lot of things,  like:
Write the vo proposal 
create a support group for the VO.
Organize the  vo community 
create a site where people can reports VO problems.
Crate a document with the services that the VO will be support.

<pre> 
Starting with the specific: The technical setup was straight forward. 
You need to setup a VOMS server, that is quite simple compared with other OGS services. 
We tweaked our systems to better integrate to our LDAP system, 
creating a 2 level access (internal vs. external resources). 
But you don't need this, specially if you are going to use pilot jobs.

In a broader sense: The learning curve of grid technology is really steep. 
Issuing certificates, globus commands, static linked applications... 
This is really difficulty, specially considering that our typical user is a scientist, not a computer geek.

In our experience we had a significant improve when we decide to install the applications 
for the users and to provide a simplified submission system, based in wrapper scripts. 

The important thing is to understand what are your users needs 
(large datasets (input or output), applications, progress files, MPI or SMP, processing time, memory...) 
and try to simplify the usual workflow. 
For instance, having a myproxy server and automatically generate and renew certificates for the internal users helped a lot.
