---+ 2014 OSG User School - Our glideinWMS setup

The glideinWMS setup uses a different login node than the dedicated HTCondor setup.

The name of the login node is 10g-5.t2.ucsd.edu.

It uses [[http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html][SSH public key mechanism]] for authentication.
Please send Igor your laptop's and dedicated HTCondor submit node's ssh public keys (alongside your account name) to get access.

Once the account is set-up, you will be able to login with
<pre class="screen">
ssh &lt;user&gt;@10g-5.t2.ucsd.edu
</pre>

The node is a standard Linux machine, and has HTCondor commands in the path. 

Behind the scenes, however, there are glideinWMS processing monitoring your job submissions,
provisioning nodes as needed.<br>
The glideinWMS provides both [[http://10g-4.t2.ucsd.edu/vofrontend/monitor/frontendGroupGraphStatusNow.html][a snapshot monitoring page]] and
[[http://10g-4.t2.ucsd.edu/vofrontend/monitor/frontendStatus.html][a historical monitoring page]]. 

<i>Add provisioning policy here</i>

The node also has a Web server.<br>
You can put any file you want into ~/public_html/  and it will become visible in !http://10g-5.t2.ucsd.edu/~<i>&lt;user&gt;</i>/.
