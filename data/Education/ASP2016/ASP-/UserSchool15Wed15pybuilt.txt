---+ Wednesday Exercise 1.5: Using Python, Pre-Built

In this exercise, you will install Python, package your installation, and then use it to run jobs.  It should take about 20 minutes.  

---++ Background

We chose Python as the language for this example because: 
   a) it is a common language used for scientific computing and
   b) it has a straightforward installation process and is fairly portable.  

Running any Python script requires an installation of the Python interpreter.  The Python interpreter is what we're using when we type =python= 
at the command line.  In order to run Python jobs on a distributed system, you will need to install the Python interpreter (what we often refer to 
as just "installing Python"), within the job, then run your Python script.  

There are two installation approaches.  The approach we will cover in this exercise is that of "pre-building" the installation.  We will 
install Python to a specific directory, and then create a tarball of that installation directory.  We can then use our tarball within jobs 
to run Python scripts.  

---++ Interactive Job for Pre-Building

The first step in our job process is building a Python installation that we can package up.  

   1. Create a directory for this exercise on =osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu= and =cd= into it.  
   1. Download the Python source code from https://www.python.org/. \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz</strong>
</pre>
   1. Of our options - submit server, interactive job, personal computer - which should we use for this installation/packaging process?  Once you have a guess, move to the next step.
   1. Due to the number of people on our submit server, we shouldn't use the submit server.  Your own computer probably doesn't have the right operating system.  \
The best place to install will be an interactive job.  For this job, we can use the same interactive submit file as Exercise 1.3, with one change.  What is it?  
   1. Make a copy of the interactive submit file from Exercise 1.3 and change the =transfer_input_files= line to that Python tarball you just downloaded.  Then submit it using the =-i= flag.  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_submit -i build.submit</strong>
</pre>
   1.  Once the interactive job begins, we can start our installation process.  First, we have to determine how to install Python to a specific location in our working directory.  
      1. Untar the Python source tarball and look at the =README= in the =Python-2.7.10= directory.  What will the main installation steps be?  Where will Python be installed by default?  Once you've tried to answer these questions, move to the next step.  
      1. There are some basic installation \
instructions near the top of the =README=, under the heading "If you don't read instructions".  Based on that short introduction, we can see the main steps of installation will be: \
<pre>
./configure
make
make install
</pre>\
\
This looks a lot like the GROMACS installation from earlier today!  It turns out that this three-stage process (configure, make, make install) is a common \
way to install many software packages.  \
\
Also like the GROMACS installation, the default installation \
location for Python will be a system location, =/usr/local=.  However, we'd like to install to a specific location in the working directory\
so that we can compress that installation directory into a tarball.  Try to find instructions for installing to a custom location by looking through more of the =README=.  Once you have an idea, move to the next step.  
      1.  Reading \
further into the README, the place to change where Python is installed is in the =configure= step.  Let's see if the \
=configure= script has a "help" option.  \
\
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>./configure --help</strong>
</pre>\
\
Sure enough, there's a list of all the different options that can be passed to the =configure= script.  We want the =--prefix= \
option, as that sets the installation directory.  We can use the \
 =$(pwd)= command in order to set the path correctly.  
   1. Now let's actually install Python!  
      1. From the working directory, create a directory to hold the installation.   \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>mkdir python</strong>
</pre>
      1. Move into the =Python2.7.10= directory and run the installation commands.  These may take a few minutes each.  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd Python-2.7.10</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/../python</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>make</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>make install</strong>
</pre>
   1. If I move back to the working directory, and look in the =python= subdirectory, I should see a Python installation.  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd ..</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>ls python/</strong>
bin  include  lib  share
</pre>
   1. I have successfully created a self-contained Python installation.  Now it just needs to be tarred up!  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>tar czf prebuilt_python.tar.gz python/</strong>
</pre>
   1. Before exiting, we might want to know how we installed Python for later reference.  \
Enter the following commands to save our history to a file: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>history > python_install.txt</strong>
</pre>
   1. Exit the interactive job. \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>exit</strong>
</pre>

---++ Python Script

   1. Create a script with the following lines called =fib.py=.  \
<pre class="file">
import sys

# recursive fibonacci function
def add_fib(fi,fj):
    if fi == 0:
        return 0
    elif fi == 1:
        return 1
    else:
	return add_fib(fi-1,fi-2) + add_fib(fj-1, fj-2)

# command line argument to set which number you want
n = int(sys.argv[1])
assert n > 0, "Invalid value for n"

# print value
print "The", str(n)+"th", "fibonacci number is", add_fib(n-1,n-2)
</pre>
   2. What command line arguments does this script take?  Try running it on the submit server.  

---++ Wrapper Script

We now have our Python installation and our Python script - we just need to write a wrapper script to run them.

   1. What steps do you think the wrapper script needs to perform?  Create a file called =run_fib.sh= and write them out in plain English before moving to the next step.  
   1. Our script will need to
      1. untar our =prebuilt_python.tar.gz= file
      1. access the =python= command from our installation to run our =fib.py= script
   1. Try turning your plain English steps into commands that the computer can run.  
   1. Your final =run_fib.sh= script should look something like this: \
      <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

tar xzf prebuilt_python.tar.gz
python/bin/python fib.py 5
</pre>\
   or\
      <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

tar xzf prebuilt_python.tar.gz
export PATH=$(pwd)/python/bin:$PATH
python fib.py 5
</pre>

---++ Submit File

   1. Make a copy of a previous submit file in your local directory (the GROMACS submit file could be a good starting point).  What changes need to be made to run this python job?  
   2. Modify your submit file, then make sure you've included the key lines below: \
<pre class="file">
executable = run_fib.sh
transfer_input_files = fib.py, prebuilt_python.tar.gz
</pre>
   3. Submit the job using =condor_submit=.
   4. Check the =.out= file to see if the job completed.
