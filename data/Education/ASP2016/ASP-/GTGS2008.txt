[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] (OSG), the [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]], together with the [[http://arc.georgetown.edu/index.html][Advanced Research Computing (ARC) department]] at the [[http://georgetown.edu][Georgetown University]], the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] present a three day workshop program in grid computing and its application to scientific data analysis. 

This intensive workshop introduces the techniques of grid and distributed       
computing for science and engineering fields, with hands-on training in the     
use of national grid computing resources. The workshop introduces essential     
skills that will be needed by researchers in the natural and applied            
sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support              
large-scale computation and data analysis in emerging grid and distributed      
computing environments.  

Workshop participants will work with grid computing experts during the 3-day training. The workshop will focus on enabling the use of the national     
cyberinfrastructure -[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] and [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]]- to perform             
%RED% large-scale computations %ENDCOLOR% and %RED% data-intensive processing %ENDCOLOR% in the your field of     
research. Participants will learn to use grids of thousands of processors       
and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after    
the workshop.              

The workshop will cover:

  <li> Overview of distributed computing concepts and tools                         
  <li> Concepts, tools, and techniques of grid computing

---+++ Cost

The workshop will be free to students and there will be a $100 registration fee for all other categories of participants.  

Full-time students from outside the DC area who seek travel and expense support should indicate this need in their application. A limited amount of such support may be available for transportation and lodging. We expect that most non-student participants will be from the neigboring states and/or have other means of support for the duration of the workshop.

---+++ Location

The workshop will be held Tue-Thu Apr 15-17 at the [[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wasgu-georgetown-university-conference-hotel/][Marriott Georgetown University Conference Hotel]].

Parking is available in the basement of the hotel.

---+++ Transportation and Directions
Reagan National is the best choice for the airport, in terms of proximity (15 min). Dulles and BWI are other two choices (both over 45 minutes away). 

---+++ Hotel Accomodations

A block of rooms is set aside for participants at the rate of $229 + tax per night. Please mention the group rate for Open Science Grid Training when calling [[http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wasgu-georgetown-university-conference-hotel/][Marriott Georgetown University Conference Hotel]].
