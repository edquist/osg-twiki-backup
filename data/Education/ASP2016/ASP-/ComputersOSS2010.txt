---+ Computers for OSG Summer School 2010

---++ Student computers

Students will be bringing their own laptops. (A couple of students that do not have laptop will will be provided with some.) We expect the students will do their work via ssh on other computers, so they need limited functionality on their laptops. All we ask them to have is:

   * A laptop that is fast enough for them to feel comfortable using it.
   * A working wireless connector
   * An ssh client
   * A modern, up-to-date web browser

---++ Submit host

Students will be sharing a single submit host, =vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu=. It's a 64-bit computer running Scientific Linux 5. 

There is a full OSG client installation in =/opt/osg-client=. It should be in your environment when you login. 

There is a Condor pool with about 60 batch slots available. They are 32-bit Scientific Linux 4. There is no NFS between this computer and the rest of the cluster, so Condor vanilla jobs need to use file transfer.

---++ Local Compute Element

We have a local compute element, =osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu=. It is a 32-bit computer running Scientific Linux 4. It will accept users who are in the _osgedu_ VO. Should you need to access this computer, the OSG CE installation is in =/opt/osg-1.2=. 

---++ Local Storage Element 

We have a local storage element, =osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu=. It's a simple Bestman setup with just a regular disk for storage (no Xrootd or the like). 

---++ Remote Compute Element

We have access to another compute element at the University of Lincoln-Nebraska. %RED% Brian, please fill in details here. %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Student accounts

Students will be provided with accounts (their last names) when they arrive at the school. 

---++ Student certificates

Students will get certificates and membership in the OSGEDU VO as part of Brian's Tuesday morning session. Alain will approve the certificates on the spot, as well as their membership in the OSGEDU VO.
