---+ Travel To and From Madison

Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, email us with your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---++ 1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel

Our travel budget is *very limited* this year. We budgeted an average of $475 per student for travel to and from Madison, and there are no extra travel funds. If you can travel for less than $475, that is awesome! If not, contact us immediately, and we will work together to find a good option.

Please search for the most cost-effective (yet reasonable) means to get to Madison. Here are a few ideas:

   * Instead of flying, consider driving or taking a bus or train; we can support *all* kinds of travel
   * If you must fly, look aggressively for low airfares and any special deals
   * Consider flying into Milwaukee (1&frac12; hours away) or Chicago (2&frac12; hours away) and taking a bus to/from Madison (details below)
   * Even though we offered to pay for your travel, if there is any way you can get travel funding, please do so and let us know right away!

In any case, try to make your travel plans by May 17th (5 weeks before School), before rates go up significantly.

See below for details about each travel mode:

---+++ Travel by Airplane

<span style="color: #f60;">Do NOT buy your own airline tickets!</span> Chris Battistuz (at the University of California San Diego) will buy the tickets for you.

To arrange flights to/from Madison:

   1. <p><strong>Gather personal information:</strong></p>
      * Your name, to put on ticket (should match your official ID)
      * Email address that you check regularly (should match the one we have)
      * Phone number
      * Your birthdate
   1. <p><strong>Choose your preferred itineraries:</strong></p><p>There are lots of websites for finding flights — [[http://www.hipmunk.com Hipmunk]], [[http://www.kayak.com Kayak]], [[http://www.expedia.com Expedia]], individual airlines missed by search sites ([[http://www.southwest.com Southwest Airlines]]), etc. — use them to look for (<span style="color: #f60;">but not purchase</span>) flight options. Pick 1–3 options that work for you and, ideally, cost less than $475. For each flight segment, note the date, airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, and departure and arrival airports. If you like, use standard abbreviations (Madison is “MSN” = Dane County Regional Airport):</p><pre class="screen">23 Jun (Sun), United 1122, depart 7:16am BWI, arrive  8:18am ORD
23 Jun (Sun), United 5981, depart 9:45am ORD, arrive 10:35am MSN
...</pre><p>If you send us more than one itinerary, list complete round-trip sets of flight segments, and clearly rank your choices.</p>
   1. <p><strong>Email your choices:</strong></p><p>Email to %RED%UCSD email address here%ENDCOLOR% and CC [[mailto:osg-school-2013-info@opensciencegrid.org osg-school-2013-info@opensciencegrid.org]]. Include your personal information and preferred itineraries. If we have questions, we will contact you directly. When your flight arrangements are complete, we will send you the final details, including the confirmation and ticket numbers.

Do not forget to check air itineraries to/from Milwaukee or Chicago, taking a bus from the airport directly to Madison:
   * Bus between [[http://www.mitchellairport.com][Mitchell Airport]] (MKE) in Milwaukee and downtown Madison: [[http://www.badgerbus.com/][Badger Bus]]
   * Bus between [[http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/en/home/][O’Hare Airport]] (ORD) in Chicago and downtown Madison: [[http://www.coachusa.com/vangalder/][Van Galder Bus]]
   * Bus between [[http://www.flychicago.com/midway/en/home/][Midway Airport]] (MDW) in Chicago and downtown Madison: [[http://www.coachusa.com/vangalder/][Van Galder Bus]]

*Note:* Have us buy your airline tickets now, but buy your own bus tickets right at the airport on the day of travel (see next section).

---+++ Bus or Train (or Both)

Typically, reasonable bus and train options — i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison — cost much less than air options.

If you are buying bus or train tickets ahead of time, we *may* be able to buy them for you. Otherwise, you can purchase the ticket(s) yourself and then request reimbursement. To have us purchase tickets for you, follow the instructions for Travel by Airplane, above; that is, gather personal information, choose some itineraries, and email %RED%FIX THIS%ENDCOLOR% your choices. If we cannot purchase the tickets, we will let you know.

If you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email), which should include:

   * Complete itinerary
   * Your name
   * Date of purchase
   * Total amount paid

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison
   * Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)

---+++ Personal Car

%RED%What are UCSD’s travel and reimbursement rules regarding driving???%ENDCOLOR%

If you are driving to Madison, we will reimburse you the standard government mileage rate ($0.485/mile) for the round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we may be able to reimburse you for parking costs in Madison. Keep your receipts for tolls and parking (in Madison)!

*Note:* Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We will probably limit your total driving reimbursement to $475, but talk to us about the details.
