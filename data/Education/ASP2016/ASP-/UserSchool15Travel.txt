---+ Travel To and From Madison

Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, email us with your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---++ 1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel

We budgeted an average of $500 per participant for travel to and from Madison (except in a few cases where travel will be obviously higher). Thus, we will search for travel options within that amount, but also understand that some people will have higher expenses. Within our budget, we will do our best to find reasonable travel options. Note that there are many alternative ways to find cost-effective travel:

   * Within about 5 hours driving of Madison, driving, buses, and trains may be best; we can support *all* kinds of travel
   * For flights, being flexible about departure times is important &mdash; early and late flights are often the least expensive
   * Also for flights, the best option may involve flying into Milwaukee (1&frac12; hours away) or Chicago (2&frac12; hours away) and taking a direct bus to/from Madison

In any case, we must try to complete your travel plans by mid-June, before rates go up significantly.

See below for details about each travel mode:

---+++ Travel by Airplane

<span style="color: #F60;">Do NOT buy your own airline tickets</span> (unless instructed to do so). In most cases, we will buy the tickets for you.

To arrange flights to/from Madison:

   1. <p><strong>Gather personal information:</strong></p>\
       <p>See [[UserSchool15PersonalInfo][the personal information page]] for more details. At very least, we will need:</p>
      * Your full legal name, to put on ticket &mdash; the name should match your official ID (which we should already have; clearly identify first name, last name, and (if any) middle name)
      * Your date of birth (e.g., “1 January 1992”)
      * Your gender (“male” or “female” &mdash; required by airlines, not us)
      * Telephone number
      * An email address that you check regularly (it should match the one we have already)
   2. <p><strong>Write down your travel needs and constraints:</strong></p>
      * The city or, if you like, addresses that you will travel from and return to (which may be different, although that tends to cost more)
      * The nearest airport(s) for your start and end points
      * Any hard constraints on the timing of your flights &mdash; note that preferences, such as not liking early flights, are not the same as hard constraints!
   3. <p><strong>Email your information to us:</strong></p>\
       <p>As always, email to [[mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org OSG User School &lt;user-school@opensciencegrid.org&gt;]]; Provide the following information:</p>
      * Your name, birth date, gender, telephone number, and email address
      * Your city or address of departure and return, airports, and travel constraints
   4. <p><strong>Wait for us to contact you</strong></p>\
       <p>We will contact you with the best flight itinerary that we can find and make sure that it is OK with you (<span style="color: #F60;">check your email/voicemail often!</span>). Once we find something acceptable, we will purchase the tickets for you and send you confirmation details.</p>

*Note:* Have us buy your airline tickets now, but buy your own bus tickets right at the airport on the day of travel (see next section).

---+++ Travel by Bus and/or Train

Typically, reasonable bus and train options — i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison — cost much less than air options.

Note that you must purchase all bus and train tickets yourself, ahead of time or on the day of travel, then request reimbursement from us after the School. You *must* get approval for the purchase price (or a good estimate) from us before buying the tickets.

When you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email). It would be best if the ticket contains the following information, but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your name or date) should work fine. Just get what you can! If possible, we would like:

   * Complete itinerary
   * Your name
   * Date of purchase
   * Total amount paid

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison
   * Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)

---+++ Travel by Personal Car

If you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.51/mile for the round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we may be able to reimburse you for parking costs in Madison. Keep your receipts for tolls and parking (in Madison)!

*Note: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We reserve the right to limit your total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details.*

To travel by personal car, please check with us first. We may ask you for a quote or two from other travel methods (e.g., air), to make sure that driving is indeed the least expensive method.

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Departure date from home, location (for mileage calculation), and approximate time of arrival in Madison
   * Departure date and approximate time from Madison, and return location (for mileage calculation) if different than above

---++ 2. You Are Paying for Your Travel

If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday and depart on Saturday (or else check with us first).

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)
