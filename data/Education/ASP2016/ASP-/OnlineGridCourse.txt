---+++Disclaimer
This is the Alpha Release of the online course - it is open for review and we invite your comments and suggestions (please send your ideas to gridschool-content@opensciencegrid.org)

---+++ Goal
To provide students with a basic foundation in distributed computing, and valuable hands-on training in grid computing techniques. The course introduces essential skills that will be needed by students in natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.

Materials presented here have been developed by leading experts in grid computing (founders and developers of core technologies, such as *Globus*, *Condor*, *Swift*) and include lecture notes (audio and/or video available)  and lab sessions. The course will guide through the use of national cyberinfrastructure - *Open Science Grid* and *Tera Grid* - to perform  large-scale computations and data-intensive processing that would ultimately be needed in various fields of research. 

%GREEN% *We encourage you to bring your problem or project to us, and we will do our best to match you with an expert for advice.* %ENDCOLOR%
