---+ Taxis and Travel within Madison

We will help coordinate travel within Madison for those who do not have their own transportation. This page will be updated with more detail before the School begins.

---++ Taxis to/from Madison Airport

The !DoubleTree hotel can provide free shuttle service from and back to the Madison airport, but there are limited seats available. If students need other transportation, we may be able to help with that as well. We will plan all travel from/to the airport after all students have finished their air travel plans.

---++ Travel on Campus

It is easy to walk to most places in and around the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus, and the !DoubleTree hotel is only a few blocks from the Computer Sciences building. For students who do not wish to walk, the !DoubleTree has a shuttle that can be used to transport students between the hotel and the School (and other places).

Also, there are several good taxi companies in Madison, including [[http://www.greencabofmadison.com/ Green Cab]], [[http://www.badgercab.com/ Badger Cab]] and [[http://www.unioncab.com/ Union Cab]].  There is usually an available cab on one of the main thoroughfares (e.g., University Avenue or Johnson Street) in Madison and the companies also take reservations. We will not reimburse students for taxi costs within the downtown Madison area or for personal trips.
