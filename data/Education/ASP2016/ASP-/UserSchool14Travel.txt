---+ Travel To and From Madison

Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, email us with your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---++ 1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel

We budgeted an average of $500 per student for travel to and from Madison, and there are no extra travel funds. If you can travel for less than $500, that is awesome! If not, contact us immediately, and we will work together to find a good option.

Please look for a cost-effective (yet reasonable) means to get to Madison. Here are a few ideas:

   * Instead of flying, consider driving or taking a bus or train; we can support *all* kinds of travel
   * If you must fly, plan to be flexible about departure times &mdash; early and late flights are often the least expensive
   * Consider flying into Milwaukee (1&frac12; hours away) or Chicago (2&frac12; hours away) and taking a bus to/from Madison (details below)

In any case, try to make your travel plans by the end of May, before rates go up significantly.

See below for details about each travel mode:

---+++ Travel by Airplane

<span style="color: #F60;">Do NOT buy your own airline tickets</span> (unless instructed to do so). In most cases, we will buy the tickets for you.

To arrange flights to/from Madison:

   1. <p><strong>Gather personal information:</strong></p>\
       <p>See [[UserSchool14PersonalInfo][the personal information page]] for more details. At very least, we will need:</p>
      * Your legal name, to put on ticket (it should match your official ID)
      * Your Social Security number (last 4 digits only) or U.S. visa information
      * An email address that you check regularly (it should match the one we have already)
      * Telephone number
   2. <p><strong>Investigate travel options:</strong></p>\
       <p>There are many websites for finding flight costs &mdash; [[http://www.hipmunk.com Hipmunk]], [[http://www.kayak.com Kayak]], [[http://www.expedia.com Expedia]], individual airlines missed by search sites ([[http://www.southwest.com Southwest Airlines]]), etc. &mdash; use them to look at (<span style="color: #f60;">but not purchase</span>) flight costs. Which options are usually the least expensive while still being reasonable?</p>\
       <p>Do not forget to check air itineraries to/from Milwaukee or Chicago, taking a bus from the airport directly to Madison:</p>
      * Bus between [[http://www.mitchellairport.com][Mitchell Airport]] (MKE) in Milwaukee and downtown Madison: [[http://www.badgerbus.com/][Badger Bus]]
      * Bus between [[http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/en/home/][O’Hare Airport]] (ORD) in Chicago and downtown Madison: [[http://www.coachusa.com/vangalder/][Van Galder Bus]]
      * Bus between [[http://www.flychicago.com/midway/en/home/][Midway Airport]] (MDW) in Chicago and downtown Madison: [[http://www.coachusa.com/vangalder/][Van Galder Bus]]
   3. <p><strong>Email your choices to us:</strong></p>\
       <p>[[mailto:tkidd@cs.wisc.edu Tae Kidd &lt;tkidd@cs.wisc.edu&gt;]] and CC [[mailto:osg-school-2014@opensciencegrid.org osg-school-2014@opensciencegrid.org]]. Provide the following information:</p>
      * Your name, email address, and telephone number
      * Your preferred departure airport or airports
      * The routes that seem to be the least expensive, in general
      * Your preferred destination airports (MSN, MKE, ORD, MDW)
   4. <p><strong>Wait for us to contact you</strong></p>\
       <p>We will contact you with the best flight itinerary that we can find and make sure that it is OK with you. Once we find something acceptable, we will purchase the tickets for you and send you confirmation details.</p>

*Note:* Have us buy your airline tickets now, but buy your own bus tickets right at the airport on the day of travel (see next section).

---+++ Travel by Bus and/or Train

Typically, reasonable bus and train options — i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison — cost much less than air options.

Note that you must purchase all bus and train tickets yourself, ahead of time or on the day of travel, then request reimbursement from us after the School. You *must* get approval for the purchase price (or a good estimate) from us before buying the tickets.

When you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email), which should include:

   * Complete itinerary
   * Your name
   * Date of purchase
   * Total amount paid

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison
   * Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)

---+++ Travel by Personal Car

If you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.51/mile for the round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we may be able to reimburse you for parking costs in Madison. Keep your receipts for tolls and parking (in Madison)!

*Note: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We will limit your total driving reimbursement to $500 or the cost of the least expensive flight to Madison, but talk to us about the details.*

To travel by personal car, please check with us first. We will ask you for a quote or two from other travel methods (e.g., air), to make sure that driving is indeed the least expensive method.

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Estimated round-trip mileage

---++ 2. You Are Paying for Your Travel

If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday and depart on Friday (or else check with us first about the hotel).

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)
