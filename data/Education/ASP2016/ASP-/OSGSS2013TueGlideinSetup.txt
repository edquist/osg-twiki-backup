---+ 2013 OSG User School - Our glideinWMS setup

The glideinWMS setup uses a different login node than the dedicted HTCondor setup (osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu ).

The name of the login node is:
<pre class="screen">
osg.ctbp.ucsd.edu
</pre>

You should be able to log into it from osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu.
No password needed; we use the [[http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html][SSH public key authentication]].
If you want to log in directly from your laptop (without going through osg-ss-submit), just send Igor your laptop's ssh public key.

Once in the node, it is a standard Linux machine with HTCondor commands in the path. The matching policies are described 
[[http://engage-fe.t2.ucsd.edu/vofrontend/policy.html][here]].

You have a 10GB disk quota, but you should try not to use more than 1GB at any time.

The matching policy is available on [[http://engage-fe.t2.ucsd.edu/vofrontend/policy.html][this page]].
