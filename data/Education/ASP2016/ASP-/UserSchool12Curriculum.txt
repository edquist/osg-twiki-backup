---+ 2012 OSG User School : Curriculum and Syllabus

---++ Curriculum Goals

At a high level, the goal of the School is to help students learn to:

   1. Describe the basic elements and architecture of a distributed computing system
   1. Use basic distributed computing tools to run jobs and manage data
   1. Select reasonable tools and methods to solve scientific computing problems using distributed computing
   1. Outline the role of distributed computing, its history, current state and issues, and hopes for the future
   1. Identify resources for support, further study, and development opportunities in distributed computing

---++ Syllabus

The high-level syllabus is below; <!--there is also [[OSGSS2011Schedule][a much more detailed schedule]] --> a more detailed schedule will be published later.
