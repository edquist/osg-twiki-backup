---++ Personal Grid Certificates
Admins are encouraged to obtain a personal Grid Certificate. Please consult your VO for instructions on how to get one. The USCMS website is http://www.uscms.org website. Specifically the page with instructions on how to get a certificate through USCMS is [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/GettingStarted/index.html][here]]. The USATLAS website is http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/. The wiki page with instructions on how to get a certificate is [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/Support/HowToGridCertificate.html][here]]. *Please note* that getting a certificate will take a couple of days or more depending on the availability of your local contact and his or her ability to confirm that you are who you say you are to the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA). Remember that a certificate is the first step in getting access to large amount of resources so this step is important and essential to maintaining security across the Grid. 

---++ Host and Service Certificates
All OSG sites and in general just about any grid service requires its own certificate. For the Computing Element (CE) a host certificate will be required. To obtain one you can fill out the form at https://pki1.doegrids.org/, click on the "Grid or SSL Server" link and fill out the form. Use OSG as your affiliation and select your appropriate VO. If you are going to be requesting many host and or service certificates you may want to enroll in the Grid Admins. This interface allows you to use your personal certificate to generate your host and service certificates. This is a great conveniance if you generate more than one or two certifcates for your services.
