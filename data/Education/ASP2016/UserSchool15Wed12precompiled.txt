---+ Wednesday Exercise 1.2: Using a Pre-compiled Binary

In this exercise, we will run a job using a downloaded, pre-compiled binary.  

---++ Background

In the previous exercise, we used a piece of software that was available as source code, and 
could be compiled to a static binary.  However, software is available in many different forms.  
You may also encounter scientific software provided as a static binary.  Here, the software provider 
has compiled the software for you (typically on several operating systems).  
Using a pre-compiled binary means you can avoid compiling the code yourself; 
accessing the software and getting it ready to run is as simple as downloading the binary.  

---++ Our Software Example

The software we will be using for this example is a common tool for aligning 
genome and protein sequences against a reference database, the BLAST program.  

   1. Search the internet for the BLAST software.  Searches might include "blast executable \
or "download blast software".  Hopefully these searches will lead you to a BLAST website page that looks like this: \
   <p> %ATTACHURL%/blast_executable_page.png </p>\

   1. Find the link to the downloads page for BLAST software.  \

   1. We could download the source and compile it ourselves, but instead, we're going to use \
one of the pre-built binaries.  \
Before proceeding, look at the list of downloads and try to determine which one you want.  \

   1. Based on our operating system, we want to use the Linux binary, which is \
labelled with the =x64-linux= suffix.  All the other links are either for source code or other operating systems.  \
Make sure you are in the directory you created for this exercise, then download the =tar.gz= file and un-tar it.  \

   1. We're going to be using the =blastx= binary in our job.  Where is \
it in the directory you just downloaded?  

---++ Copy the Input Files

To run blast, we need an input file and reference database.  For 
this example, we'll use the "pdbaa" database, which contains sequences 
for the protein structure from the Protein Data Bank.  For our input file, we'll use an abbreviated 
fasta file with mouse genome information.  These files are located on the 
OSG submit node at =/home/ckoch5/OSGdata=.  

   1. Copy them to your current directory: 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cp -r /mnt/gluster/osg-ss/data/mouse.fa /mnt/gluster/osg-ss/data/pdbaa ./</strong>
</pre>

---++ Submitting the Job

We now have our program (the pre-compiled =blastx= binary) and our input files, so all that 
remains is to create the submit file.  A typical =blastx= command looks something like this: 

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong> blastx -db database -query input_file -out results.txt</strong>
</pre>

   1.  Copy the submit file from the last exercise into your current directory.  
   2. Think about which lines you will need to change or add to your submit file in order to submit \
the job successfully. In particular: 
      * what is the executable?
      * how can you indicate the entire command line sequence above?  
      * which files need to be transferred in addition to the executable?  
      * does this job require a certain type of operating system?  
\
   3. Try to answer these questions and modify your submit file appropriately.  
   4. Once you have done all you can, check your submit file against the lines below, which contain the necessary changes \
to run this particular job.  
      * The executable is =blastx=, which is located in the =bin= directory of our downloaded BLAST \
directory.  We need to use the =arguments= line in the submit file to express the rest of the \
command. \
\
<pre class="file">
executable = ncbi-blast-2.2.31+/bin/blastx
arguments = "-db pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out results.txt"
</pre>\

      * The BLAST program requires our input file and database, so they must be transferred with =transfer_input_files=. \
\
<pre class="file">
transfer_input_files = pdbaa/, mouse.fa
</pre>\

      * Because we downloaded a Linux-specific binary, we need to request machines that are running Linux.  \
\
<pre class="file">
requirements = (OpSys == "LINUX")
</pre>\

   1. Submit the blast job using =condor_submit=.  The job should run in just a few minutes and produce a file called =results.txt=.
