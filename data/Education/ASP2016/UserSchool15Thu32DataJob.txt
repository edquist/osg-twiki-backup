----+ AWS server to worker node

Imagine that your collaborator prepared the input data for your computing job and uploaded to a public
websever.  A straight forward approach is to download the files from the webserver to your local submit directory then submit the job. Alternatively, you tell condor to download directly from the webserver to the worker machine. As an example, we download the NAMD input files from AWS server.

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd namd-condor/namd-ct-web </strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>ls </strong>
</pre>

<pre class="file">
namd_run.sh    # Job wrapper script to execute namd job
namd_run.submit    # Condor job description file
</pre>
We see only two files.  Input files are located at http://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/osg-user-school/namd in AWS server. As we did in the previous exercise,  we need to tell condor that ==par_all27_prot_lipid.inp==, ==ubq_gbis_eq.conf==, ==ubq.pdb==, and ==ubq.psf==  files are required by NAMD simulation for execution on remote worker machine.


<pre class="file">
Universe = vanilla
Executable = namd_run.sh
transfer_input_files =  ----------------------------
output        = job.out
error         = job.error
log           = job.log
requirements = (HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= TRUE)
Queue 1
</pre>

To see how it works
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_submit namd_run.submit </strong>
</pre>

After the completion of job, do

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong> tail -n 2 ubq_gbis_eq.log   </strong>
</pre>

and if you see the following two lines
<pre>
WallClock: 95.105576  CPUTime: 95.105576  Memory: 57.796875 MB
Program finished.
</pre> 
your job is successful.
