---+ Meals and Food during the School

---++ Welcome Dinner

On Sunday evening, we are hosting a group dinner at 6:30 p.m. at one of the two student union buildings located on the UW–Madison campus.

If you arrive in time, Tim Cartwright will meet you (and other students) in the lobby of the !DoubleTree. Then, at 6:20 p.m. or so, the entire assembled group will walk together to the Union.

---++ School Meals

The School pays for your meals, which fall into two categories. First, we provide the following meals directly:

   * Breakfasts on Monday through Thursday — held in Computer Sciences Room 1240, the same room as the school sessions
   * Lunches on Monday through Thursday (except one day, below) — held in a lobby of the Computer Sciences building (we will guide students there and back)
   * Lunch on one day — held at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery, a new and beautiful building located just two minutes from the Computer Sciences building (we will guide students there and back, and we hope to arrange a brief tour of the building after lunch)

Second, you are on your own for dinners Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and we will reimburse you after the School. To get your money back, follow these rules:

   * Keep receipts for your dinners
   * Do not exceed $17 per dinner, including tax and tip (no more than 15% tip)
   * We cannot pay for any alcohol, but non-alcoholic drinks are OK — so pay for any alcohol on a separate bill
   * Get a reimbursement form before you leave the School
   * Complete the reimbursement form and send it back to us within a month (details TBD)
