---+ Tuesday Exercise 2.2: Software Differences in the OSG

The goal of this exercise is to see the differences in availabilty of software in the OSG. At your local cluster, you may be used to having certain versions of software but out on the OSG, it's possible that the software you need won't even be installed. 

---++ Refresher - condor_status

The OSG pool, like the local pool you used yesterday, is just another HTCondor pool. This means that the commands you use will be the same and the jobs you submit can be the same but there is one major difference: the slots are different! You can use the =condor_status= command just as you did yesterday to inspect these slots. Go ahead and open two terminal windows, log in to =osg-ss-submit= and =osg-ss-glidein-submit=, and run =condor_status=.

Notice any differences? 

---++ Comparing Operating Systems

To really see differences between slots in the local cluster vs the OSG, you will want to inspect the slot !ClassAds and compare them between the two. Rather than inspecting the entire, very long !ClassAd for every slot, you will look at a specific attribute called =OpSysAndVer=. This attribute tells us the operating system and version of the slot and we can show this attribute easily with the =-autoformat= option. =-autoformat= like the =-format= option will print out the attributes you're interested in for each slot but as you probably guessed, perform the formatting in an automatic way. You can give the option multiple attributes and it will print them all:

<pre class="file">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_status -autoformat &lt;attribute 1&gt; &lt;attribute 2&gt;...&lt;attribute N&gt;
</pre>

So to show the operating system and version of each slot, run the following command in both of your terminal windows:

<pre class="file">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_status -autoformat OpSysAndVer
</pre>

You will see many values with the type of operating system at the front and the version number at the end (i.e. SL6 stands for Scientific Linux 6). The only problem is that with hundreds or thousands of slots, it's difficult to get the big picture composition of each pool from this output. You can find a count for each operating system by feeding the =condor_status= output into the =sort= and =uniq= commands. Your command line should look something like this:

<pre class="file">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% condor_status -autoformat OpSysAndVer | sort | uniq -c
</pre>

Can you spot the differences between the two pools now?
