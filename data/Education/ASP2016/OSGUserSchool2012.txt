---+ 2012 OSG User School

<strong><font size="+1">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</font></strong>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, June 25–28, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool12Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

As part of the complete program, you will also go to the [[https://www.xsede.org/xsede12 XSEDE12 Conference]], July 16–20, in downtown Chicago. This is a premier event for the high-performance computing (HPC) community, offering students a view into another approach to large-scale computing.

Students accepted to this program will receive *financial support* for all or most costs associated with both events (see the application for further detail).

---++ Applications

Applications closed on April 9, 2012. We plan to notify applicants around Monday, April 16, 2012. Thanks for your interest!

If you applied and do not have a letter of recommendation submitted yet, please have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to [[mailto:gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org]] (any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best). For the letter, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the “2012 OSG User School” in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.
