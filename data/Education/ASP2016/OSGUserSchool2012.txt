---+ 2012 OSG User School

<strong><font size="+1">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</font></strong>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, June 25–28, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool12Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

As part of the complete program, you will also go to the [[https://www.xsede.org/xsede12 XSEDE12 Conference]], July 16–20, in downtown Chicago. This is a premier event for the high-performance computing (HPC) community, offering students a view into another approach to large-scale computing.

Students accepted to this program will receive *financial support* for all or most costs associated with both events (see the application for further detail).
