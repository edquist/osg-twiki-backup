---+ 2012 OSG User School

<strong><font size="+1">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</font></strong>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, June 25–28, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool12Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

As part of the complete program, you will also go to the [[https://www.xsede.org/xsede12 XSEDE12 Conference]], July 16–20, in downtown Chicago. This is a premier event for the high-performance computing (HPC) community, offering students a view into another approach to large-scale computing.

Students accepted to this program will receive *financial support* for all or most costs associated with both events (see the application for further detail).

<strong><font size="+1">This is a great opportunity — apply today!</font></strong>

---++ Applications

Applications are now open. The *deadline for applications is Friday, March 30, 2012,* end of the day. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

   * Complete the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/osgus-2012/][online application form]] (link goes to VDT website)
   * Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to [[mailto:gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org]]<br/>(any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the “2012 OSG User School” in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

   * Be graduate students (but see below)
   * Need for large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery
   * Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)
   * Be available to travel to Madison in late June and Chicago in mid-July (foreign students: check your passport and visa now!)

*Not a graduate student?* We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework; make a strong case for yourself! For others (staff, faculty, researchers, etc.), we have very limited funds this year and may not be able to accommodate you. But feel free to put in a strong application, and we will do what we can.

---++ Spread the Word

Please spread information about the school to people you know who may be interested. We will be sending many announcement emails in early March, 2012, but if you know a good candidate, just send them to this website!

Another way to help: [[%ATTACHURL%/2012OsgUserSchool.pdf Download our flyer]], print copies, and post in prominent locations where good candidates might see it!
