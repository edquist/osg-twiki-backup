---+!! Obtaining a New Certificate with cacl

%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

A valid certificate was already installed for you and configuration was set up to use it. In this step we will attempt to get a new certificate from the San Diego Supercomputer Center certificate authority (SDSC CA) using a command-line tool called cacl.

Certificates issued by the SDSC CA will be valid on many grid resources, as it is a widely trusted certificate authority.

---+++ Request credential from cacl

<pre class="screen">
tg-login1 /users/train99> cacl

You already have a .globus directory.  It will be moved to 
.globus.old and a new .globus directory will be created. 

Please enter your login password: <userinput>SDSC password from instructors</userinput>
 
Next you will be prompted to enter a password which will serve as both
the encryption key for your certificate's private key and as the 
'export password' for your PKCS#12 converted certificate.  Please choose 
a password that you can remember, you will need to use it in the future.


Please enter your private key encryption password: <userinput>choose your own password and remember it!</userinput>
Verifying private key password, please reenter password: <userinput>same again</userinput>



You already have a certificate issued by this CA.  If you have forgotten 
your private key encryption password, lost your certificate or key,
or suspect that your certificate and key may have been compromised you
can request that your current certificate be revoked.  This will make
current certifcate invalid and unuseable.  It will also allow you to
immediately get a new certificate to replace your current certificate.



Would you like your current certificate to be revoked? [yes/no]: <userinput>yes</userinput>



You now have a .globus directory containing the following files: 

usercert.p12 - Your digital certificate and private key in 
               a PKCS#12 format certificate 

usercert.pem - Your digital certificate, signed by the CA 
               daemon 

userkey.pem  - Your encrypted private key matching the 
               public key contained in your usercert.pem 


********************************************************** 

 YOUR CERTIFICATE IS VALID FOR FOUR YEARS, DO NOT FORGET 
 YOUR PRIVATE KEY ENCRYPTION PASSWORD AND, DO NOT DELETE 
 YOUR .globus DIRECTORY.

---+++ Proxy certificate using CACL Certificates
First we need to ensure the SDSC certificates have been installed correctly and a proxy can be generated.

<pre class="screen">
[train31 ~]$ <userinput>grid-proxy-init -cert sdsccert/usercert.pem -key sdsccert/userkey.pem -out sdscProxy -verify</userinput>
Your identity: /C=US/O=SDSC/OU=SDSC/CN=Training User 99/UID=train99
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity: <em><strong># not echoed!</strong></em>
Creating proxy ............................................ Done
Proxy Verify OK
Your proxy is valid until: Fri Jun 23 22:14:26 2006
[train31 ~]$ 
</pre>

There are several grid-proxy-init options used:
   * =-cert= and =-key= allow you to specify non-default certificate and key file locations.
   * =-out= allows you to specify a non-default location for the proxy file.
   * =-verify= ensures that both the certificates used to create proxy and the CA are installed correctly and valid.

The contents of this proxy can be viewed using the _grid-proxy-info_.

<pre class="screen">
[train31 ~]$ <userinput>grid-proxy-info -file sdscProxy </userinput>
subject  : /C=US/O=Globus Alliance/OU=User/CN=10c00791bfb.54294d53/CN=1488313937
issuer   : /C=US/O=Globus Alliance/OU=User/CN=10c00791bfb.54294d53
identity : /C=US/O=Globus Alliance/OU=User/CN=10c00791bfb.54294d53
type     : Proxy draft (pre-RFC) compliant impersonation proxy
strength : 512 bits
path     : sdscProxy
timeleft : 11:58:33
[train31 ~]$ 
</pre>

The =-file= allows you to specify a non-default location for the proxy file.

The environment variable _X509_USER_PROXY_ can be set to the proxy location. These tools will use that rather than default location. 

%NOTE% The issuer of the proxy is the DN from your SDSC certificate.
