This trip is all expenses covered. However, you will need to pay for a few expenses out of pocket and be reimbursed.

   * *Air Fare*: We will pay for air fare directly.
   * *Hotel*: We will pay for hotel directly.
   * *Meals in Madison, WI*: We will provide breakfast, lunch, and two group dinners (Sunday & Thursday). You will need to pay for the other dinners and we will reimburse you for up to $NN/day. %RED%*Ginny: Would that be $20? Another amount?*%ENDCOLOR%
   * *Meals while traveling*: Unfortunately, we cannot cover meals while traveling. %RED%Ginny--true or false?%ENDCOLOR%

This is a two-step process:

*Step 1: Email Peggy*
Contact Peggy by email, wagner@sdsc.edu, with the following information:

   * Full name
   * Email address you check regularly
   * Arrival date (For most of you, this should be July 18th)
   * Departure date (For most of you, this should be July 23rd)
   * City/Airport you will depart from
   * If you are traveling internationally, you'll also need:
      * Kind of visa
      * Scanned copy of visa
      * Copy of I-9, if you get one when you arrive in the US.

*Step 2: Call Peggy*
If you have a social security number, contact Peggy by phone, +1 (858) 534-5121, and tell her:
   * Full name
   * Social security number

The social security number is needed in order to pay for your expenses. 

Please make your air travel arrangements as soon as possible. If possible, please keep your air fare under $500. (International travel excluded.)

---++ Hotel Arrangements OSG Summer School
Once we have your confirmation that you will be coming to the school, we will organize hotel for you if you are from out of town. You only need to email us, gridschool-2010-info@opensciencegrid.org, with your arrival and departure dates. If possible, please email us your itinerary so we can keep an eye on your flights to watch for problems.

We will make hotel reservations, but only for the nights of July 18-22. If you want to come earlier or stay later, you will need to make separate arrangements. Because we are paying for your hotel directly, you must make a separate reservation if you wish to extend your stay.

We will cover your basic expenses. If you charge anything extra to your room (meals, movies, etc), you will need to provide a credit card for that. %RED%*Sarah, can you double-check that?*%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Air travel for the !TeraGrid Conference
For those of you also traveling to the !TeraGrid conference (most of you), you should schedule your air travel with Peggy at the same time. 

---++ International Students
%RED%Ginny, is this right? Or does it only apply to people traveling internationally? %ENDCOLOR%

If you are not a US citizen, please bring your passport and visa with you to the school. This will help us reimburse you.
