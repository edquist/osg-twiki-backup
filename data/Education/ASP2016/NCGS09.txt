[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] (OSG),  the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] and RENCI present a 2-day course in grid computing and its applications to scientific discovery. 

Researchers and IT administrators, managers and staff at Triangle area campuses and beyond are invited to attend the workshop to learn about large-scale distributed and high throughput computing and how they can enhance research practices and enable discoveries. The workshop will introduce techniques used in large-scale computational research through hands-on training. Participants also will be introduced to the national community of technical experts that provide this computational infrastructure at campuses across the U.S.  

*Day one* will focus on using the infrastructure and *day two* will address how campuses can contribute their computational resources to the infrastructure, both at the local campus level and by participating in national cyberinfrastructure efforts. Attendees can attend day one, day two or both days of the workshop based on their interests and their campus roles. 

%RED% Day one, April 22 %ENDCOLOR%, will be aimed mainly at users and potential users of OSG resources. The focus will be on enabling the use of campus Condor grids and the national OSG to perform large-scale computations and data- intensive processing. Participants will learn how to use grids of thousands of processors and will be able to continue to use these resources for their research after completing the course. Topics to be covered include:

<ul>                                                                        
  <li> Overview of distributed computing concepts and tools                         
  <li> Concepts, tools, and techniques of grid computing                            
  <li> Discovering and using grid resources                                         
  <li> Grid scheduling and distributed data management                              
  <li> Techniques for workflow and collaboration  
</ul>

%RED% Day 2, April 23 %ENDCOLOR%, will be aimed primarily at the resource providers. Participants will learn how to build a local campus grid, and share resources at the national level. Day two topics include:

   * Overview of campus-level and national-level cyberinfrastructure 
   * Building a campus grid using Condor
   * Joining a campus grid to the OSG

Attendees should have at least intermediate programming skills (one to two semesters experience in C/C++, Java, Perl and/or Python) and hands-on experience with UNIX or Linux in a networked environment.

---+++ Cost

The workshop will be FREE to all categories of participants.  

Full-time students and qualified individuals from outside the Chapel Hill area who seek travel and expense support should indicate their need in the application. A limited amount of such support may be available for transportation and lodging. We expect that most non-student participants will be from the neighboring states and/or have other means of support for the duration of the workshop.

---+++ Location

The workshop will be held Wednesday and Thursday, April 22-23 at the Renaissance Computing Institute ([[http://www.renci.org/about/locations/renci-anchor-at-europa-center][RENCI]]), 100 Europa Drive, Chapel Hill.  
We will meet in Biltmore room on the 5th floor of the building. There will be signs from the elevators to the room.

---+++ Transportation and Directions

The closest airport is [[http://www.rdu.com][RDU]] in. Please see the [[http://www.renci.org/about/locations/renci-anchor-at-europa-center][visitor's information pages]] for directions and more information. 

---++++ Parking

Parking is free.
 
 
---+++ Accommodation

If you are coming from outside the triangle area, a good hotel is [[http://www.sheratonchapelhill.com/][Sheraton Chapel Hill]]. Mention "RENCI" when booking your room.
