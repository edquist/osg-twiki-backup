---+ Wednesday Exercise 1.6: Python Installation

In this exercise, you will write a wrapper script that installs Python and then use it to run jobs. This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

---++ Background

In the previous exercise, we used a method that pre-built Python and then used that pre-built package to run Python scripts.  In this 
exercise, we will use an alternative method for running Python jobs, by writing a wrapper script that installs Python with every job.  This exercise 
should be done in the same directory as the previous exercise.  

---++ Source Code

Each job will need to transfer the Python source code, so it should be downloaded to the submit node.  

   1. In the directory you used for the last exercise, download the Python source code: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz</strong>
</pre>

---++ Wrapper script

Our wrapper script will need to install Python from the source code and then run our =fibonacci.py= script.  

   1. Based on the previous exercise, what are the steps we need to install Python?  What file can we use for reference?  
   1. Put the installation steps into a script called =run_py.sh=
   2. Check your script against the file below \
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

mkdir python
tar xzf Python-2.7.10.tgz
cd Python-2.7.10
./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/../python
make
make install
cd ..
</pre>\

   1. We also need to run our =fibonacci.py= script.  We can do so by adding our installation location to the =PATH=, or by referencing the installation directly: 
     <pre class="file"> export PATH=$(pwd)/python/bin:$PATH
python fibonacci.py 5</pre>\
     or\
      <pre class="file"> python/bin/python fibonacci.py 5</pre> \
   Choose whichever method you prefer, and add it to your =run_fib.sh= script.   

---++ Submit file

The submit file for this exercise can be very similar to the [[UserSchool15Wed15pybuilt][last one]].  

   1. Make a copy of the submit file from the last exercise.  What lines need to change?  Make changes as appropriate.  
   1. Submit the job using =condor_submit=.
   1. Check for the results in the =.out= file.
