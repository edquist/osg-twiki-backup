---+ Taxis and Travel within Madison

We will help coordinate travel within Madison for those who will not have their own transportation.  This page will be updated with more details as the school approaches.

---++ Taxis at airport

Taxis and the hotel shuttle will be arranged to pick up groups of students who arrive at the airport and need a ride downtown.  We will coordinate with students after flights have been arranged.

---++ Travel on campus

Campus is very walkable and the DoubleTree is only a few blocks from the Computer Sciences building.  However, in the event of inclement weather, the DoubleTree has a shuttle that can be used to transport students between the school and hotel.  

There are also a number of reputable taxi cab companies in Madison, including [[http://www.greencabofmadison.com Green Cab]], [[http://www.badgercab.com Badger Cab]] and [[http://www.unioncab.com Union Cab]].  There is usually a free cab on one of the main thoroughfares (e.g. University Avenue, Johnson Street) in Madison and they also take reservations.
