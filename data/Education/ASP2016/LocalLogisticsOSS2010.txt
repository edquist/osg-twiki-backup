---++ Hotel 

All out of town attendees will be staying at the [[http://doubletree1.hilton.com/en_US/dt/hotel/MSNDTDT-Doubletree-Hotel-Madison-Wisconsin/index.do][DoubleTree Madison Hotel]]

It is located at [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=525%20W.%20Johnson%20St.%2C%20Madison%2C%20Wisconsin][525 W. Johnson St., Madison, Wisconsin]], about 6 or 7 blocks from the Computer Sciences Department. Most people can walk to the department in 10-15 minutes. 

---++ School 

---+++ Location

The school will be held in the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/location.html][Computer Sciences Department]], located at [[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1210%20West%20Dayton.%2C%20Madison%2C%20Wisconsin][1210 West Dayton St., Madison, WI, 53706]]. 

Walking directions from the Doubletree:
   * Walk west (left) out the front door of the Doubletree Hotel. You'll be going down Johnson Street.
   * If you want, get a fancy coffee at [[http://www.coffeebytes.net/index.php][Coffee Bytes]] (one block North in [[http://www.usquaremadison.com/][University Square]]) or at the !Jo2Go in [[http://www.grandcentralmadison.com/][GrandCentral apartments]]. !Jo2Go makes a great espresso.
   * Turn left on Charter Street. Walk one block to Dayton St.
   * Turn right onto Dayton St. The CS building is the big building with glass doors on your right, just past the Subway shop. 

We will use two different rooms:

| *Day* | *Room* |
| Monday | 4310 |
| Tuesday | 4310 |
| Wednesday | 3310 |
| Thursday | 4310 |

Finding 4310:
   * Enter the CS building through the glass doors on Dayton St.
   * Turn left. Go through two sets of double-doors. 
   * Take the elevator to the fourth floor for 4310
   * Turn left out of the elevator, walk to the corner. 
   * Turn left, then immediately right into another hallway.
   * Go through the door, 4310 will be on your left.

The building is a bit confusing--we'll post signs to help you find your way. You can always just ask people for directions if you get lost.
