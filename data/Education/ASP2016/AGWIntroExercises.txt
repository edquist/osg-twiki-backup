---+!! Tutorial: An Introduction to the Grid
%TOC%

These exercises introduce you to the computing environment and to a few grid commands.

You will be working in teams of two people, sharing a computer. You will be given a training account name and a password for that account.

You will need the following tools:

    * An ssh client
    * A web browser

---++ Conventions

These conventions for command-line dialogs that will be used throughout these exercises:
   * What you type is in *bold*. The system's responses are in regular text.
   * Our comments to you (which you should *not* enter) look like:  <pre><i># some comment here</i></pre>

What you type is in *bold*. The system's responses are in regular text.

Our comments to you (which you should *not* enter) look like:  <pre><i># some comment here</i></pre>

<pre class="screen">
computer$ <userinput>pwd</userinput>           <em># You type "pwd" but NOT this comment!</em>
/home/ccttraining42     <em># the system's response</em>
/home/ccttraining42   <em># the system's response</em>
computer$               <em># the system's command prompt</em>
</pre>

---++ Connecting to %LOGINHOST% 

You will be doing almost all the lab exercises this week on a Linux computer ("host") named %LOGINHOST%.

Using your ssh client, connect to %LOGINHOST% using the username and password that you are given by the course instructors.
