---+ 2010 OSG Summer School

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn to harness the power of distributed computing!*

During the school, July 19–22, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in computer science or other sciences where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, but any qualified and interested applicant will be considered. We are *accepting applications now* for students. Successful applicants will have all travel and school expenses paid for by the OSG. Furthermore, as part of a collaboration with [[https://www.teragrid.org/][TeraGrid]], students will go to the annual !TeraGrid Conference (TG’10, August 2–5 in Pittsburgh, PA) with all travel and conference expenses paid. This is a great opportunity!
