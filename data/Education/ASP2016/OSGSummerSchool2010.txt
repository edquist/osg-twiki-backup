---+ 2010 OSG Summer School

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn to harness the power of distributed computing!*

During the school, July 19–22, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in computer science or other sciences where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, but any qualified and interested applicant will be considered. We are *accepting applications now* for students. Successful applicants will have all travel and school expenses paid for by the OSG. Furthermore, as part of a collaboration with [[https://www.teragrid.org/][TeraGrid]], students will go to the annual !TeraGrid Conference (TG’10, August 2–5 in Pittsburgh, PA) with all travel and conference expenses paid. This is a great opportunity!

---++ Apply Now!

Applications are now open. The *deadline for applications is Monday, May 31, 2010,* end of the day. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

   * Complete the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/osg-school-2010-app/][online application form]]
   * Have a letter of recommendation emailed to gridschool-2010-info@opensciencegrid.org

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify you and the 2010 OSG Summer School in the letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

   * Be graduate students, or else be junior faculty, academic staff, or other role and have a good story
   * Be interested in grid computing, from the perspective of either computer science or a scientific end-user
   * Have basic experience with the Linux command line
