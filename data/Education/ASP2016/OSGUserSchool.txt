|  4 months prior| Open registration<br/>Start looking for hotel and teaching facility |
|  3½ months prior| Broadcast second round of advertisements (“Only two weeks left to apply!”) |
|  3 months prior| Close registration |
|  3–2½ months prior| Review applicants<br/>Select students for roster |
|  2½ months prior| Notify applicants of decisions |
|  2 months prior| Acceptances due<br/>Start arranging travel |

---++ Other Tasks

   * *Instructors* Select, invite, and arrange travel for instructors, including HTC Showcase ones. Generally, this task occurs after the high-level curriculum has been designed and before it gets too late for (a) travel arrangements, and (b) content development. It is probably a good idea to make initial contact with key instructors about 3 months out, and aim to settle the core instructor list at 6–8 weeks out. Much later than that, and instructors will be hard to schedule, travel will be expensive, and content development will be rushed. For each remote instructor, offer to arrange and pay for travel (airfare, rental car, mileage, parking) and hotel. Invite all instructors to participate in as much of the schedule as they like, especially the social events. Active remote collaborators may have other activities that they can perform locally, so they may easily fill the whole week with events, School and otherwise. Be sure to contact HTC Showcase invitees early, to get on their schedules; assuming the School is during the academic summertime, it would not hurt to make initial inquiries before the spring semester is out.

   * *Ground Transportation* Most students will arrive at the airport and will need transportation to the School hotel (or other venue, depending on timing). Look for groups of students arriving on the same flight or on closely spaced arrivals, and help them meet each other and share transportation. If using taxis, see if any groups are large enough to warrant a minivan, shuttle bus, or other special vehicle. Make backup plans for when flights arrival early or late, and be sure that students have a clear means of communicating transportation changes _en route_.

   * *Content Development* Ask content providers for an initial outline and then a draft set of materials. Try to get all outlines together and distribute to other instructors (as appropriate). An outline should document goals, objectives, major points, methodology used, and timing for each subsection of content; it sounds like a lot of detail, but each item can be just a single line, and a full day’s plan easily fits in a page or two. Check the outlines for a good mix of lecture and interactive segments, for appropriate content, and for gaps and overlap with other instructors’ materials. Draft materials should show the full span of the session, but may have small details missing. Check the drafts for content, style, and completeness. Make sure the hands-on portions are drafted as well, and blend well with other materials. Ideally, each section of the curriculum has extra, self-directed hands-on exercises for those students who finish the core curriculum quickly.

---++ Mentoring Plan

For the 2011 School, we have some new ideas for making the Mentoring system a bit more robust:

   * Send a survey to students at 3, 6, and 12 months after the School. Ask students about: contact with mentor and community at large; progress on HTC projects; open questions.
   * Have one follow-up call with students and mentors, maybe right after the 3-month survey. Ask how things are going and how to improve.
   * Require contact reports from mentors every two months. Ask about: number of contacts, reason(s) for lack of contact if so, and a basic progress update.

---++ Follow-Up Events

Students who continue to be involved in HTC work should be invited to participate in other events:

   * *OSG All-Hands Meeting* Find out the !AHM schedule well in advance (3–4 months), plan how to integrate students into event with organizers, identify strong candidates, find budget for travel, invite students, etc.
   * *Condor Week* Similar process, mostly for students working in/with Condor itself. Consider inviting to present, or set up a poster session and make sure attendees are driven toward it.
