The OSG Gridschools provide a basic foundation in distributed computing and valuable hands-on training in grid-computing techniques to students in a variety of fields, including the natural and applied sciences, social sciences, engineering, and computer science. Working with leading experts in grid computing, participants learn essential skills to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging Grid computing environments through a blend of lectures, discussions and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources.
