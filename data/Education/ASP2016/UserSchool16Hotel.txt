---+ Hotel Information

We have reserved a block of rooms at the following hotel:
   * [[http://www.innonthepark.net/][Best Western Premier Park Hotel]], located on the Capitol Square near campus. The hotel does have a shuttle for transporting students, as well as access to many bus lines on the square.
 
Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---++ 1. If We Offered to Pay for Your Hotel Room

All you need to do is tell us your travel plans (arrival and departure dates and times), and we will reserve your room and pay for basic room costs. One student per room.

*NOTE:* Even if we are paying for your hotel room, when you check in, you must provide the hotel with a credit card — it is only for optional expenses that you cause by yourself. We will pay only for the room charge and its taxes.

---++ 2. If You Are Paying for Your Hotel Room

You may stay anywhere you like, although we suggest that you let us reserve one of the Best Western rooms for you. It is convenient and the rates are very competitive for this part of Madison. Nearly all School events will be held in the Computer Sciences building, which is within walking distance of the hotel or a short shuttle or bus ride. It is your choice, but if you decide to stay at the Best Western, you must let us know your travel plans (arrival and departure dates and times) so that we can reserve the room.

No matter where you stay, please tell us where it is, so that we know how to contact you locally.
