---++ Welcome!
Welcome to the web site of the 2007 Midwest Grid Workshop. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science grid]] (OSG), the [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]] together with the [[http://http://www.ncdm.uic.edu/][National Center for Data Mining]] (NCDM) and the [[http:http://www.lac.uic.edu/][Laboratory for Advanced Computing]] at the Univeristy of Illinois at Chicago, and the [[http://www.icair.org][International Center for Advanced Internet Research]] at Northwestern University, present a two-day weekend workshop program in grid computing and its application to scientific data analysis.

---++ Aim and Purpose
The aim of the workshop is to give the students a basic foundation in distributed computing, and valuable hands-on training in computing techniques. The workshop introduces essential skills that will be needed by students in the natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.

Participants will work with some of the world's leading experts in grid computing, through a blend of lectures, discussions and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources. 

---++ Location
The workshop will be held Saturday-Sunday March 24-25 at the [[http://www.uic.edu/depts/chcc/sce.html][East Student Center]] of the [[http://www.uic.edu][University of Illinois at Chicago]], adjacent to downtown Chicago Illinois.

The center's address is 750 South Halsted Street
Chicago, Illinois 60607

---++Schedule

Each day of the workshop will run from 9:00 am to 6:00pm on both days, with a one hour lunch break. Each day will consist of four lectures (of 30 minutes), each followed by longer hands-on laboratory time (90 minutes). Lecturers and assistants will provide assistance during lab sessions and be available for discussion and follow-up.

A Saturday night social event, to be announced, will be planned.

---++ Cost

The workshop will be free to full-time students, and $50.00 for faculty or non-academic attendees.
A $50.00 deposit will be required from all students, to be refunded upon completion of the workshop.

A select number of participants who complete the Midwest workshop may be invited to attend the 4th annual International Summer School in Grid Computing to be held in Mariefred, Sweden, near Stockholm, from 8th to 20th July 2007, with expenses paid by the Open Science Grid through the generous support of the National Science Foundation.  This is a rare opportunity to hear about the latest achievements in Grid computing from Europe, North America and Asia, as well as to gain experience of a variety of Grid systems.

---++Technology
Examples and training will utilize [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][Open Science Grid]], [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]] and a small "laboratory Grid" dedicated to the workshop program.
