---++ Using scripting languages

At this point, you might be asking yourself, "This is all well and good, but I don't write programs in C. Can I use other languages?" Absolutely.

Let's assume you like to write program in Bourne shell. Make sure your program begins with =#!/bin/sh=, and you're good to go. Try out this example:

<pre style="margin-left:4em" class="screen">
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: simple.sh <sleep-time> <integer>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Thinking really hard of $1 seconds.."
sleep $1
answer=$(( $1 * 2 ))
echo "We calculated $answer."
exit 0
</pre>

Can you write a submit file to run this job? This should be easy--the script is your _Executable_, not "/bin/sh".

---++ Challenge
Rewrite this script in Perl or Python (if you're comfortable with one of those languages). Does it still work for you?
