---+ OSG User School 2016

<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Come spend a week at the beautiful University of Wisconsin–Madison and learn how!*

During the school, 25–29 July, you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems — at your own campus or using the national Open Science Grid (OSG) — to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and *lots of hands-on activities* with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. Take a look at [[UserSchool16Curriculum][the high-level curriculum and syllabus]] for more details.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any science or research domain where large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process, plus we will consider applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff. <span style="color: #F60;">Students accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School.</span>

<strong><font size="+1">This is a great opportunity — apply today!</font></strong>

---++ Applications

Applications are now open. The *deadline for applications is Friday, 15 April 2016,* end of the day. Submit your application soon to ensure consideration!

To apply, complete both of the steps below (in parallel, if you like):

   * Complete the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/osgus-2016/][online application form]] (link correctly goes to vdt.cs.wisc.edu website)
   * Have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to [[mailto:user-school@opensciencegrid.org user-school@opensciencegrid.org]]<br/>(any reasonable format is fine; we like PDF or plain text best)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally — ideally a faculty member or other supervisor. They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG User School 2016” in the subject line and letter, so that we can associate your application and letter.

Ideal candidates will:

   * Be graduate students (but see below)
   * Need for large amounts of computing, which could transform research or open new paths to discovery
   * Have basic experience with the Linux command line (or learn beforehand)
   * Be available to travel to Madison in late July (foreign students: check your passport and visa now!)

*Not a graduate student?* We consider applications from advanced undergraduates, especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework; make a strong case for yourself! Also, we consider other groups (post-doctoral students, faculty, researchers, staff, etc.), especially if you convince us that this opportunity is likely to have a significant effect on your work or research.

---++ Spread the Word

Please tell people who may be interested in the School about us. We will send email announcements in mid-March 2016, but you can send anyone to this website at any time!

Another way to help: [[%ATTACHURL%/osg-user-school-2016-flyer.pdf Download our flyer]], print copies, and post in prominent locations where good candidates might see it!
