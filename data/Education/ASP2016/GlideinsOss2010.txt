---+ Glidein Hands-on Session, Wednesday July 21st, 2010 

<b><font size=+2 color=red>Work in progress</font></b>

This session will give you hands-on experience in using the glideinWMS.

The session is logically split in three pieces:
   * Glideins from the user point of view
   * glideinWMS for the VO administrator
   * glideinWMS for the factory administrator

All users should go through the first part (for the users);<br>
the other two are optional.

I strongly encourage all users to look at the frontend part;<br>
it is likely you will get involved in that part since you attended this school!

The glidein factory part is instead meant to be for CS students
that want to know more about the internals of the glideins.

---++ Local setup

As with all the other hands-on exercises, we will be using <br>
<tt>vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu</tt><br>
to submit and monitor our jobs.

However, we will use <b>a different Condor instance running on that same machine</b>.<br>
The reason for having a different instance is due to the security requirements
of having a Condor pool spread across the WAN (see also the [[%ATTACHURL%/pilots_and_glideinwms_lecture.pdf][lecture]]).
Interested students can talk to me to get a more detailed information,
for all the others, you just need to make sure you point to the right Condor installation.

To use the proper Condor instance, please run:
<pre>
[sfiligoi@vdt-itb ~]$ source /opt/glidecondor/condor.sh 
</pre>

At any given point, you can check you are using the right one by using:
<pre>
[sfiligoi@vdt-itb ~]$ which condor_submit
/opt/glidecondor/bin/condor_submit
[sfiligoi@vdt-itb ~]$ echo $CONDOR_CONFIG
/opt/glidecondor/etc/condor_config
</pre>
