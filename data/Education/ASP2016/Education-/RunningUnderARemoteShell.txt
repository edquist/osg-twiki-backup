Fully qualified pathnames are necessary when running commands under globus-job-run, because by default it does not start a UNIX "shell" on the remote system and its the shell that implements mechanisms like searching for commands in your =$PATH= variable, and many other features, like input/output redirection ( e.g., =>foo=), pipes (e.g., =cmd1|cmd2=) and =$VAR= substitution. But we can tell globus-job-run to run a shell for you on the remote Grid site, and pass the command string to that remote shell:

Try for example:

<pre class="screen">
gridlab1$ <userinput>globus-job-run gridlab2/jobmanager-fork /bin/sh -c "grep train /etc/group | wc -l"</userinput>
</pre>

Experiment for a few minutes with this to try a few shell commands and pipelines on gridlab2, gridlab3 and gridlab4. How similar are these machines?

Common Linux system commands are typically, but not always, found in the same directory on all Linux systems, and this week we'll be using Grid systems with exclusively Linux-based hosts. In real work, organizations establish conventions for such things, which will be touched on when we discuss production Grids.
