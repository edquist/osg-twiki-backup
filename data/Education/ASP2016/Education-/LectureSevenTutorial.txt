In this exercise:

<pre class="screen">
<userinput>The code that you can directly key in will appear in this color</userinput>
<replaceable>The code that you can need to change before typing in will appear in this color</replaceable>
The probable response from the system appears in this color.
</pre>



<a name="write"></a>
---++ Writing the application
Write a simple application to find whether a number is a prime or not. [[http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~lchitnis/grid/summer-grid/prime.c.html][Sample code]] is available. The program takes three inputs:
   1. The Number in question
   1. Starting factor (&gt;1)
   1. Ending factor 


It outputs =YES= if the number is a prime and =NO= if it is not.

Login to =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu=.

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@trainingXX ~]$ <userinput>ssh gridlab1.phys.utb.edu</userinput>
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ 
</pre>



Write (read 'copy-paste') the program and save it as "=prime.c=" . Compile and execute it locally on the laptop / gridlab machine.

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]<userinput>gcc -w -o prime prime.c</userinput>
.
.
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]<userinput>./prime 1000 2 1000</userinput>
NO
</pre>


%NOTE% You may ignore any compilation warnings for now, as long as there are no errors and you got the correct response.



<a name="gridify"></a>
---++ Readying the application for the Grid
We know that it takes long time to divide the number with all the factors.
So, we will distribute the application to various sites. Each site will 
divide the number with different range of factors. This is equivalent to running

<pre class="screen">
./prime 1000 2 250
./prime 1000 251 500
./prime 1000 501 750
./prime 1000 751 1000
</pre>

on a single machine. A negative answer from any of the sites indicates that a factor other than 1 and the number itself exists and hence it is NOT a prime number.


<a name="run"></a>
---+++ Running a job on !TeraGrid/OSG sites

<!--    <li>If you didn't follow the instructions for 'preparing to run on Grid3'
    yesterday, please do so. The  [[http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~wilde/summer-grid/Exercises/7_prep_Exercise.v2.htm][instructions are available]]. 
    <li>Login to =terminable.uchicago.edu= or =evitable.uchicago.edu=. You do not have to enter a password
-->
<!--
    <li>Copy your credentials to =evitable.uchicago.edu=. You might have to enter a passphrase. The passphrase is the same as your training account usernames (e.g. training24)
<pre class="screen">
<b>
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ scp -r ~/.globus/ evitable.uchicago.edu:~/
Enter passphrase for key '/home/trainingXX/.ssh/id_dsa':

Check your proxy. Make sure it is valid for more than 3 hours.

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>grid-proxy-info </userinput>
</pre>

Initialize your proxy (if it is not initialized or is about to expire)

Your proxy is valid until: Mon Jul 11 01:00:53 2005
</pre>

---+++ To find a site on OSG

[[http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat/home/][GridCat]] (<span class="firstterm">Grid Catalog</span>) is one of the monitoring tools available that can be used to get a good view of your Grid. For instance, it can provide [[http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/index.php?site_name=osgitb][a summary of the sites that are in the OSG-ITB VO]].

%NOTE% You are authorized to use only the sites under the OSGEDU VO. 
   
The various OSG-ITB sites that are expected to have your DNs populated in their gridmap-files are:

<pre class="screen">
  UFlorida-EO           (url:ufgrid05.phys.ufl.edu, $app:/raid/raid4/eo/app)  (verified!)
  CIT_ITB_1             (url:citgrid3.cacr.caltech.edu, $app:/raid1/OSG_APP)  (verified!)
  FIUPG (OSG PROD site) (url:fiupg.ampath.net, $app:/share/apps)              (verified!)
<!--  FNAL_FERMIGRID_TEST   (url:fgtest1.fnal.gov, $app: /usr/local/app)  (verified!) -->
</pre>

Use =globusrun= to verify that you are authorized to use a site and can authenticate to it:

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>globusrun -a -r ufgrid05.phys.ufl.edu/jobmanager-fork</userinput>
GRAM Authentication test successful
</pre>


For this exercise, you can also use the following !TeraGrid sites:

<pre class="screen">
tg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org        (verified!)
<strike>tg-login1.ncsa.teragrid.org</strike>
</pre>




---++ Testing a Site

Let's test a site:

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>globus-job-run ufgrid05.phys.ufl.edu /bin/date</userinput>
Sun Jul 10 23:25:25 CDT 2005
</pre>

Copy your application to the site. <b><font color="red">Wait !</font></b> You don't know where to copy the files. Is there any temporary directory available? But, how do you find it?

If you plan to use any of the OSG sites, and you are authorized to do so (GRAM Authentication test successful), go to the [[http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/index.php?site_name=osgitb][GridCat]]
page again.

%NOTE% If you're testing on FIU-PG, go [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/][here]] to access the production !GridCat instance. 
   
   1. Choose 'Grid Environment* from the *view* drop down menu.
   1. In the table, find the OSG site you plan to use.
   1. Under that listing, the *Logical Disk Name* =$app= is the APPDIR you will be using. 
   
The APPDIR is where you should copy your applications. (After making a separate directory, of course. You don't want your application to be messed up by other students, do you?).


---+++ Finding $TG_CLUSTER_SEARCH for <nop>TerraGrid
If you plan to use the !TeraGrid sites, you need to know the value for =$TG_CLUSTER_SCRATCH=. The string to which this variable is mapped onto on the remote site is the directory where you can temporarily "stage" your application (your APPDIR). You can use the [[http://www.teragrid.org/userinfo/jobs/environment.php][TerraGrid Programming Environment page]] to look up the correct =$= variable that you need. In your case, its going to be the =$TG_CLUSTER_SCRATCH= variable. 

To look up the value of this variable, we are going to "peek" into the remote site using =gsissh=. This will use your grid proxy to authenticate you into a remote grid site.

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>gsissh tg-login.sdsc.teragrid.org</userinput>
.
.
Directory: /home/ac/train33
Tue Jun 27 17:48:22 CDT 2006
train33@tg-login.sdsc> <userinput>/usr/bin/env | grep "TG_CLUSTER_SCRATCH"</userinput>
TG_CLUSTER_SCRATCH=/gpfs/train33
train33@tg-login.sdsc> <userinput>exit</userinput>
</pre>

Use this =TG_CLUSTER_SCRATCH= as the APPDIR for the following part of the exercise for this grid site. You need to do this for each of the !TeraGrid site that you plan to use.

<!-- A small test script has been copied in the ncsa and sdsc TG sites which can enable you to peek into the remote site and see this variable. 

<pre class="screen">
globus-job-run TG-SITE /tmp/getenv
</pre>
-->
%NOTE% If the =TG_CLUSTER_SCRATCH= var is not defined (blank), *STOP!* Ask your TAs for further instructions!


Now you can go ahead and 
   1. Create your workspace in the APPDIR
   1. "Stage-in" your application with =globus-url-copy=
   1. Execute your application

Remember to replace =SITE=, =APPDIR= and =YOURUSERNAME= with values that are appropriate for you.


<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>globus-job-run <replaceable>SITE</replaceable> /bin/mkdir <replaceable>APPDIR/YOURUSERNAME</replaceable></userinput>
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>globus-url-copy file://`pwd`/prime gsiftp://<replaceable>SITE</replaceable>/<replaceable>APPDIR</replaceable>/<replaceable>YOURUSERNAME</replaceable>/prime</userinput>
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>globus-job-run <replaceable>SITE</replaceable> /bin/chmod +x <replaceable>APPDIR</replaceable>/<replaceable>YOURUSERNAME</replaceable>/prime</userinput>
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>globus-job-run <replaceable>SITE</replaceable> <replaceable>APPDIR</replaceable>/<replaceable>YOURUSERNAME</replaceable>/prime 200 2 200</userinput>
NO
</pre>

---+++ EXTRA CREDIT: Make the application distributed. 

Write a small program that calculates the number of jobs required and divides them equally among the three sites. 

<pre class="programlisting">
root = <font color="#2e8b57"><b>int</b></font>(sqrt(num));
inc = <font color="#ff00ff">10</font>;
njobs = <font color="#2e8b57"><b>int</b></font>((root - <font color="#ff00ff">2</font>)/inc) + <font color="#ff00ff">1</font>;

start = <font color="#ff00ff">2</font>;


<font color="#853e26"><b>for</b></font>(i = <font color="#ff00ff">0</font>;i &lt; njobs; ++i) {
        end = start + inc;
        <font color="#5151fb">/*</font><font color="#5151fb"> choose a site </font><font color="#5151fb">*/</font>
        <font color="#5151fb">/*</font><font color="#5151fb"> run the job on the site with globus-job-run with appropriate</font>
<font color="#5151fb">           arguments </font>

<font color="#5151fb">           globus-job-run $site $num $start $end</font>
<font color="#5151fb">           </font><font color="#5151fb">*/</font>
        start = end + <font color="#ff00ff">1</font>;
}
</pre>

You may want to try this out later if it is taking too much time. Go on ahead and complete the easy parts first!

<a name="together" />
---++ Putting it all together (Optional)
Write a script to submit jobs to multiple sites automatically. I have created a small application package that has
all the required tools. It contains:
   * Makefile to compile your application
   * script for distributing the jobs

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>./script.pl</userinput>
Usage: ./script.pl &lt;task number&gt;
    1 - Make dir
    2 - Copy exes
    3 - Run prime jobs
    4 - Grep output
    5 - Remove dir
</pre>


---++ A Condor-G submission file
Download the [[%ATTACHURL%/dprime.tar.gz][dprime.tar.gz package]]. Modify the script to fit your needs.

You need to tailor some variables in =script.pl=:
   * Change the value of the =$me= variable to your username &mdash; *must do*
   * Change the number you want to test for primality (the =$num= variable) &mdash; *not mandatory*
