%EDITTHIS%

%STARTINCLUDE%
These conventions for command-line dialogs that will be used throughout these exercises:
   * What you type looks like =<userinput>this</userinput>=. The system's responses are in =regular text=.
   * Our comments to you (which you should *not* enter) are =<em># set off by a "#" and in italics</em>=

<pre class="screen">
computer$ <userinput>pwd</userinput>           <em># You type "pwd" but NOT this comment!</em>
/home/ccttraining42     <em># the system's response</em>
computer$               <em># the system's command prompt</em>
</pre>
