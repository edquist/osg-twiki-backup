---++ Personal Grid Certificates
Admins are encouraged to obtain a personal Grid Certificate. Please consult your VO for instructions on how to get one. The USCMS website is http://www.uscms.org website. Specifically the page with instructions on how to get a certificate through uscms is [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/GettingStarted/index.html][here]]. The USAtlas website is http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/. The wiki page with instructions on how to get a certificate is [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/Support/HowToGridCertificate.html]here]]. *Please note* that getting a certificate will take a couple of days or more depending on the availability of your local contact and his or her ability to confirm that you are who you say you are to the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA). Remember that a certificate is the first step in getting access to large amount of resources so this step is important and essential to maintaining security across the Grid.
