---++ Joe J. Mambretti 

Dr. Joe J. Mambretti is Director of the International Center for Advanced Internet Research at Northwestern University (iCAIR), which is focused on developing digital communications for the 21st Century. The Center, which was created in partnership with a number of major high tech corporations (www.icair.org), has established projects in four mission areas, advanced applications, advanced network middleware, and advanced infrastructure as well as public policy studies related to advanced communications. He is also Director of the Metropolitan Research and Education Network (MREN, http://www.mren.org), an advanced high-performance network interlinking organizations in seven upper-midwest states including several national, major research universities, corporate research labs, and other advanced national and international networks.


---++ Michael Wilde
Michael Wilde is a Software Architect in the Distributed Systems Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory, Mathematics and Computer Science Division, a fellow of the Computation Institute at the University of Chicago, and a member of the Globus Alliance. Wilde served as the project coordinator of the Grid Physics Network, www.griphyn.org and is currently the education coordinator of the Open Science Grid.

---++ Rachana Ananthakrishnan
Rachana Ananthakrishnan is a Senior Software Developer at Argonne National Laboratory working on design and development of the Globus Toolkit(GT). She developed the current authorization engine in the Java Globus Tookit 4.0 Core, as well as many of the available plug-ins, and is now leading all Java Globus Tookit security development work. She also worked on the GT3 security infrastructure, developed the Community Authorization Service (CAS), and the GT4 Delegation Service.

Rachana started working in the area of distributed computing as a Research Assistant at the Extreme Computing Lab at Indiana University, where she completed her Masters in Computer Science.


---++ Robert Grossman
Dr. Robert Grossman is the Director of the Laboratory for Advanced Computing (LAC) and the National Center for Data Mining (NCDM) at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The Lab and Center perform research, sponsor standards, manage an international data mining testbed, and engage in outreach activities in the areas of data mining and data intensive computing.

Bill Allcock is a Software Engineer with the Distributed Systems Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory. He is the technology coordinator and evangelist for GridFTP within the Globus Alliance. In his 15 years work experience he has been involved in a wide array of areas including Grid / distributed computing, computer networking, embedded systems, data acquisition, process engineering, control system tuning, and colloidal chemistry. Bill's current research focus involves applications requiring managed access to large (Terabyte and Petabyte sized) data sets, so called DataGrid problems. He is also heavily involved in the Global Grid Forum (a Grid computing standards organization).

Dr. Grossman became a faculty member at the University of Illinois at Chicago in 1988 and is currently Professor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and Professor of Computer Science. From 1984-1988 he was a faculty member at the University of California at Berkeley. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1985 and a B.A. from Harvard in 1980. He currently holds a part time appointment at UIC.

Robert Grossman is also the Founder and Managing Partner of Open Data Partners LLC, which provides strategic, consulting, and data services so that businesses can use their data more effectively. 

Borja Sotomayor is a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. His research lies in the intersection of Grid Computing and virtualization. In particular, his work focuses on resource management for virtual workspaces, an abstraction for execution environments that can be dynamically deployed on a grid. Currently, the most widespread models for execution management on grids are based on the job abstraction. Virtual workspace are not meant to replace the job abstraction, but to provide a more powerful and flexible execution environment when the job abstraction imposes too many constraints on the user, and can also complement the job abstraction by providing on-demand execution environments for a user's jobs.
