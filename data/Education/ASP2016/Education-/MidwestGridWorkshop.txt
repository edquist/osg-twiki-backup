---++ Welcome!
<img src="http://conferences.fnal.gov/interlab2006/images/Gridworkshop1.jpg" style="float:right; width:308px; height:231px;">Welcome to the web site of the 2007 Midwest Grid Workshop. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science grid]] (OSG), the [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]] together with the [[http://http://www.ncdm.uic.edu/][National Center for Data Mining]] (NCDM) and the [[http://www.lac.uic.edu/][Laboratory for Advanced Computing]] at the [[http://www.uic.edu][University of Illinois at Chicago]], the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] and the [[http://www.icair.org][International Center for Advanced Internet Research]] at Northwestern University, present a two-day weekend workshop program in grid computing and its application to scientific data analysis.

<br style="clear:both;">

---++ Aim and Purpose
The aim of the workshop is to give the students a basic foundation in distributed computing, and valuable hands-on training in computing techniques. The workshop introduces essential skills that will be needed by students in the natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.

Participants will work with some of the world's leading experts in grid computing, through a blend of lectures, discussions and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources.

---++ Location

The workshop will be held Saturday-Sunday March 24-25 at the [[http://www.uic.edu/depts/chcc/sce.html][Student Center East (SCE)]] of the [[http://www.uic.edu][University of Illinois at Chicago]], adjacent to downtown Chicago Illinois.

The center's address is 750 South Halsted Street
Chicago, Illinois 60607

Registration will take place in SCE-605, and the workshop will be held in room 401. These are both in the SCE Tower, at the North end of the Student Center. If you enter SCE from the main entrance on Halsted, follow the signs up the escalator, north to the elevator, and then to the 6th and 4th floors.

---++ Directions

Directions to UIC campus may be obtained at the following link.  [[http://www.uic.edu/index.html/visiting.shtml]]

A map showing parking and the Student Center Building is [[%ATTACHURL%/uicmap.v2.pdf][here]]. Note that the Crowne Plaza hotel is about 8 blocks north, on Halsted at Madison, on this map.  Walk south on Halsted to get to the UIC campus and Student Center East.
 
---++ Accomodations

Crowne Plaza Hotel,
733 West Madison,
Chicago, IL  60661; 
For reservations call 312-829-5000 and reference Midwest Grid.

 

---++Daily Schedule

Each day of the workshop will run from 9:00 am to 6:00pm on both days, with a one hour lunch break. Each day will consist of four lectures (of 30 minutes), each followed by longer hands-on laboratory time (90 minutes). Lecturers and assistants will provide assistance during lab sessions and be available for discussion and follow-up.

A Saturday night social event, to be announced, will be planned.

---++ Cost

The workshop will be free to full-time students, and $50.00 for faculty or non-academic attendees.
A $50.00 deposit will be required from all participants, to hold a seat at the workshop. The deposit will be refunded upon completion of the workshop.

---++ Student Support

Students from outside the Chicago area who would seek travel and expense support should indicate this need in their application. A limited amount of such support may be available for transportation and lodging. We expect that most students will be from the Chicago area and/or have other means of support for the weekend's expenses.

---++ Opportunity to participate in International Grid School

A select number of participants who complete the Midwest workshop may be invited to attend the 4th annual International Summer School in Grid Computing to be held in Mariefred, Sweden, near Stockholm, from 8th to 20th July 2007, with expenses paid by the Open Science Grid through the generous support of the National Science Foundation.  This is a rare opportunity to hear about the latest achievements in Grid computing from Europe, North America and Asia, as well as to gain experience of a variety of Grid systems.

---++Technology
Examples and training will utilize [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][Open Science Grid]], [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]] and a small "laboratory Grid" dedicated to the workshop program.

---++Workshop Syllabus is at MidwestSyllabus

The Midwest Grid Workshop Syllabus and lecture details can be found on the MidwestSyllabus pages (also available from [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/workshop][www.opensciencegrid.org/workshop]]).
