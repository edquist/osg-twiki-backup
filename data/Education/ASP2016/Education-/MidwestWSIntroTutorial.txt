---+!! Tutorial: An Introduction to the Grid
%TOC%

These exercises explore some simple Grid operations to start developing a few very basic techniques for distributed computing.

We assume you're using the default "bash" shell set up on your logins on the laptops and lab servers. We recommend you don't change your shell.

---++ Connecting to the Linux training hosts 


You will be doing almost all the lab exercises this week on a set of Linux computers ("hosts") named =workshop1=, =workshop2=, =workshop3= and =workshop4= (its "fully qualified host name" looks like "workshop1.lac.uic.edu").  From these machines, we will run Grid jobs and explore various Grid sites.

To access this machine from your computer, we will use "secure shell".

On a Windows machine, we will use the PuTTY program. Open PuTTY and enter the hostname of the computer that you will use.

On a Mac, we will use the Terminal and ssh command-line tool. Open Terminal and type =ssh= followed by your training user name, an "@" symbol and the name of the computer you wish to connect to. For example:
<pre class="screen">
mac$ <userinput>ssh train42@workshop1.lac.uic.edu</userinput>
The authenticity of host 'workshop1.lac.uic.edu (206.76.233.104)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 36:74:78:a8:ed:6b:38:96:63:20:01:df:46:9b:59:3b.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <userinput>yes</userinput>
Warning: Permanently added 'gridblab1.phys.utb.edu,206.76.233.104' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
train42@gridblab1.phys.utb.edu's password: <userinput>PASSWORD</userinput>  <em># not echoed !!!</em>
workshop1$     <em># Now you're talking to a shell on the workshop1 server</em>
</pre>

After the first time you do this, you won't get the "Are you sure." prompt. Some of you will never see this, as your computers were used for testing this material, and the "yes" reply was already supplied by a tester.  So it will look like:

<pre class="screen">
mac$ <userinput>ssh train42@gridblab1.phys.utb.edu</userinput>
Password: <userinput>PASSWORD</userinput> 
workshop1$
</pre>

You should be able to reach all four lab hosts - workshop1 .. workshop4 - in this manner.

For the rest of this exercise, we will use simpler prompts: =$laptop= for commands typed directly to the shell of your laptop Terminal window, and =gridlab1$= for the gridlab1 lab server.

---++ Conventions

Note the conventions for command-line dialogs that will be used throughout these exercises:

What you type is in *bold*. The system's responses are in regular weight text.

Our comments to you (which you should *not* enter) look like:  <pre><i># some comment here</i></pre>

<pre class="screen">
laptop$ <userinput>pwd</userinput>           <em># You type "pwd" but NOT this comment!</em>
/home/ccttraining42   <em># the system's response</em>
laptop$               <em># the system's command prompt</em>
</pre>

In these exercises, we'll use the prompt =laptop$= for responses from the shell on the lab laptops, and =workshop$= (or =workshop1$=, =workshop2$=, =workshop3$=, etc.) for responses from remote shells. 

%NOTE% The actual shell prompts you'll see may be different from those we show here.

To start, practice cutting text from your this page in your web browser to run a command or set of commands: cut the =pwd= command from the box above and paste it into your terminal window to execute it. This is a good way to avoid making typos while entering commands from the examples.
