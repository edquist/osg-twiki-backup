The scale of hardware depends on the size of cluster you want to run.
The following node worked well for us at Fermilab as a Compute Element, Condor
Master, and NFS Server, with 60 worker nodes running 5 batch slots apiece.
Master, and NFS Server, with 60 worker nodes running 5 batch slot apiece.

Dual Xeon 3.2GHz (hyperthreaded)
4GB RAM
2x250 GB SATA system drives (software mirror if desired)
3ware 9500S-4LP RAID controller with four 400GB SATA drives in RAID 5
(hot swap), gives about 1TB usable space.
Cost of system approximately $4500 in late 2005.

If you have more money to spend, spend it on RAM.  Can never have too much.
Also however much RAM you have, have twice that much swap.

If you are going much above 60 nodes, it pays to have a separate machine
be your NFS file server to serve the APP and DATA areas and also to export
the Worker Node Client files to the workers.

In a cluster of 200 nodes or more we also split off the condor master to be 
a different machine than either the gatekeeper or the NFS server.
