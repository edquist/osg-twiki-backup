This topic sets out how to connect to the Linux gridlab hosts and to log onto the Grid during the tutorials at the Grid Workshops. This topic should be kept current and INCLUDEd in the topics that are

You will be doing almost all the lab exercises this week on a Linux computer ("host") named "gridlab1" (its "fully qualified host name" is "gridlab1.phys.utb.edu").  From this machine, we will run Grid jobs and explore various Grid sites.

To access this machine, from your laptop Terminal window, we will use the "secure shell" utility, ssh, to do a "remote login" from your laptop to the gridlab1 Linux server:

<pre class="screen">
laptop$ <userinput>ssh train42@gridlab1.phys.utb.edu</userinput>
The authenticity of host 'gridlab1.phys.utb.edu (206.76.233.104)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 36:74:78:a8:ed:6b:38:96:63:20:01:df:46:9b:59:3b.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <userinput>yes</userinput>
Warning: Permanently added 'gridblab1.phys.utb.edu,206.76.233.104' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
train42@grodlab1.phys.utb.edu's password: <userinput>summergrid</userinput>  <em># not echoed !!!</em>
gridlab1$     <em># Now you're talking to a shell on the gridlab1 server</em>
</pre>

After the first time you do this, you won't get the "Are you sure." prompt. Some of you will never see this, as your computers were used for testing this material, and the "yes" reply was already supplied by a tester.  So it will look like:

<pre class="screen">
laptop$ <userinput>ssh train42@gridlab1.phys.utb.edu</userinput>
Password: <userinput>summergrid</userinput>  <em># enter trainingN or NN here, same as your laptop name</em>
gridlab1$
</pre>

You should be able to reach lab hosts gridlab2, 3, and 4 in the same manner.

For the rest of this exercise, we will use simpler prompts: =$laptop= for commands typed directly to the shell of your laptop Terminal window, and =gridlab1$= for the gridlab1 lab server.
