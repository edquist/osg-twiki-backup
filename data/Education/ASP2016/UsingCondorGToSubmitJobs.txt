---+!! Using Condor-G to Submit Jobs to OSG and <nop>TeraGrid

%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

_Condor-G_ allows one to use Condor tools to submit jobs to Globus resources. You can think of it as a sophisticated =globus-job-run=. One
of the useful features is the ability to submit and monitor multiple jobs to grid resources.

<a name="ajob" />
---+++ Submitting a single job using Condor-G
In the Condor world, one has to write a submission file that describes the application your are submitting. A sample submission file is below.

<pre class="programlisting">
%GREEN%########################################
#                       
#  A sample condor submission file
#                                        
########################################%ENDCOLOR%
                                         
executable =  prime
universe = <b>vanilla</b>

output  = prime.out                
error   = prime.error             
log     = prime.log  
arguments = 107 2 107

queue
</pre>


Note the universe variable. If the universe used is vanilla, the job is infact executed on the submitting site itself. The condor on =gridlab1.phys.utb.edu= is configured to run jobs locally.

To submit jobs to a remote resource, the universe should be set to =grid=. Let's see a submission file for the grid universe.

<pre class="programlisting">
%GREEN%########################################
#                       
#  A sample Condor-G submission file
#                                        
########################################%ENDCOLOR%

executable = <replaceable>APPDIR</replaceable>/<replaceable>YOURUSERNAME</replaceable>/prime

transfer_executable = false
universe       = <b>grid</b>
grid_resource = <b>gt2 <replaceable>SITE</replaceable>/jobmanager</b>
log            = prime.log
arguments      = 100 2 100
output = prime.out

queue
</pre>

Submit your prime application using this submission file to a site. You can monitor your application using =condor_q=

<pre class="screen">
[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>condor_submit example.sub</userinput>
Submitting job(s).
Logging submit event(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 33.

[johndoe@gridlab1 ~]$ <userinput>condor_q</userinput>

-- Submitter: gridlab1.phys.utb.edu : &lt;206.76.233.104:36236&gt; : gridlab1.phys.utb.edu
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               
   9.0   training24      7/10 23:39   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  prime             

1 jobs; 1 idle, 0 running, 0 held
d86 16
</pre>

   $ *%GREEN% TIP %ENDCOLOR%*: If condor_q lists too many entries, you can use the =job-id= to refer your job. In the above example, this is =33= in the line =1 job(s) submitted to cluster 33= returned by =condor_submit=. Now you can just do =condor_q <replaceable>XXX</replaceable>=. You can also try using =condor_q train<replaceable>XX</replaceable>= to enlist jobs submitted by user trainXX.


You can try various options like =-long= and =-globus= with condor_q to see more details.

---+++ Checking output
Check the output file =prime.out=.

<a name="multiple" />
---+++ Submitting multiple jobs to multiple sites using Condor-G

There are various ways to use Condor-G to submit multiple jobs to multiple sites:
   * Write multiple submission files and changes attributes manually or using a script. This is clumsy and difficult to manage.
   * Write a single common submission file and dynamically change only the attributes that need to be changed

First, we must identify the attributes that need to be changed for different instantiations of the application:
   * range of divisors
   * site names
   * application directories
   * output file names

How do we do this? By passing parameters to =condor_submit=:


<tt>condor_submit -a "arguments = $num $start $end" -a "grid_resource = gt2 $site/jobmanager" ...</tt>

The strings that you specify with =-a= option get added to the submission file you specify.


Write a common submission file and submit three instantiations of your prime application to three sites. Note that you have to use different output file names for each instantiation. 

Create a submission file named =example.sub= with following contents
<pre class="programlisting">
%GREEN%####################
[johndoe@gridlab1 dprime]$ <userinput>mkdir output</userinput>
# Submission file for prime number finder
#
####################%ENDCOLOR%

transfer_executable = false
[johndoe@gridlab1 dprime]$ <replaceable>condor_submit -a "arguments = 1000 2 1000" -a "output = output/1.out" -a "grid_resource = gt2 ufgrid05.phys.ufl.edu/jobmanager" -a "executable = APPDIR/YOURUSERNAME/prime" example.sub</replaceable>
log            = prime.log
queue
</pre>

Note that we do not specify the site and arguments.

Create a directory for the output files:

<pre class="screen">
[%LOGINNAME%@%LOGINHOST% dprime]$ <userinput>mkdir output</userinput>
[johndoe@gridlab1 dprime]$ <userinput>grep NO output/*</userinput>

Submit a job using the submission file by passing arguments to =condor_submit=:

<pre class="screen">
[%LOGINNAME%@%LOGINHOST% dprime]$ <replaceable>condor_submit -a "arguments = 1000 2 1000" -a "output = output/1.out" -a "grid_resource = gt2 ufgrid05.phys.ufl.edu/jobmanager" -a "executable = APPDIR/YOURUSERNAME/prime" example.sub</replaceable>
</pre>

Submit multiple jobs to multiple sites. Note that you have to copy your executables to the site, if it doesn't have it already. Use !GridCat to find the APP variables.
[johndoe@gridlab1 dprime]$ <userinput>globus-job-run <replaceable>SITE</replaceable> /bin/rm -rf <replaceable>APPDIR</replaceable>/<replaceable>YOURUSERNAME</replaceable></userinput>
