---+ Security Exercises - Understand your certificate

This exercise will give you some understanding of your x.509 certificate

%TOC%

---++ Environment

We will use the usual node:<br>
=vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu=

---++ Exercise 1 - !OpenSSL

You should have your DOEGrids-issues certificate in:<br>
=~/.globus/=.

You have two files:
   * =usercert.pem= - This is the public part of the certificate. It contains the description of the certificate, including the public key, but does not contain not the private key.
   * =userkey.pem= -  This file contains the private key of the certificate. *Keep it secret!*

You can peek at the content of the certificate, using [[http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/x509.html][openssl]]. It is installed on most Linux systems by default.

Try it out. 

The most complete output is obtained using the =-text= flag, but others are useful as well.

What do you see?

%TWISTY{
showlink="Next step"
hidelink="Hide"
start="hide"
mode="div"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
One of the things you should have seen, is that the cert was issued by DOEGrids CA.

The CA public certificates are pre-installed in =/etc/grid-security/certificates/=.<br>
Each CA has a set of files, with *.0 being the certificate.

The files are encoded using a SSL-internal scheme. You can find the right name under the your certificate "CRL Distribution" section.

Run openssl against the DOEGrids certificate.<br>

---++ Exercise 2 - Creating a proxy

To create a proxy, you have to use the globus tools that are part of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_Grid_Prox][OSG client installation]].

For starters, try out =grid-proxy-init=. This will create a proxy for for you.

To check the status of the proxy, use =grid-proxy-info=.

Try it. <br>
What do you see?

%TWISTY{
showlink="Show tips"
hidelink="Hide"
start="hide"
mode="div"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%

One obvious thing to change is the proxy lifetime. Try the =-valid= option.

You can also change the location of the proxy, by either using the =-out= option, or by setting X509_USER_PROXY.

---++ Exercise 3 - Creating a VOMS-extended proxy

As explained during the lecture, OSG requires VOMS attributes to authorize you at Grid sites.

To create a proxy, you have to use the VOMS tools that are part of the 
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_VOMS_Prox][OSG client installation]].

The tool to use is =voms-proxy-init=. It works very similarly to =grid-proxy-init=, you just need to add the VOMS attribute you want to get.
In our case we will use:<br>
=-voms osgedu:/osgedu/2011OSGSummerSchool=

To check the status of the proxy, use =voms-proxy-info=.

Try it. <br>
What do you see?

As usual, the two commands have plenty of options. Try them out.

%TWISTY{
showlink="Show tips"
hidelink="Hide"
start="hide"
mode="div"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%

There are two interesting options of =voms-proxy-info=:
   * =-all= - You have to specify this to see the VOMS attributes. Without, it works pretty much just =grid-proxy-info=.
   * =-chain= - Shows you all the chain up to the originating CA.

Try them out.

You may have noticed you used voms-proxy-init for the exercises this morning. Well... now you know what it was used for.
