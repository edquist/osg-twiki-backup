---+ 2012 OSG User School Logistics

This page contains a great deal of reference information about attending the School. Please read it carefully! If you have any questions, email us at:

   gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org

Use that address for *all* emails about the organization of the School.

*Note:* Logistics for the XSEDE12 Conference are handled separately by the XSEDE12 program committee. They will contact you by email to arrange travel to Chicago.

---++ Schedule

The detailed schedule will be posted soon.

For travel planning: The School begins on Monday morning (June 25), but it is best to arrive before about 5 p.m. on Sunday. Sunday evening, we will host a welcome dinner for students and instructors, which is a nice way to get to know each other and start the week. Please plan to arrive Sunday if at all possible. The School finishes with another dinner on Thursday evening (June 28). You may leave any time on Friday. We will pay for five nights of your hotel stay: arriving Sunday and leaving Friday.

---++ Travel To and From Madison

Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, email us with your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---+++ We Offered to Pay for Your Travel

Next, decide how you will travel to/from Madison:

---++++ Travel by Airplane

Please do NOT buy your own airline tickets! Cathy Richard, here in the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Computer Sciences department, will buy the tickets for you.

When looking for tickets, consider both schedule and cost. We budgeted $450 for your air travel. It may be acceptable to exceed that amount, but we need to work with you closely in that situation. If you spend less than $450, we may be able to reimburse you for ground transportation (if needed) or be able to help your fellow students with their travel.

There are three easy steps to arrange your flights to/from Madison:

   1. <p><strong>Gather personal information:</strong></p>
      * Your name, to put on ticket (should match your official ID)
      * Email address you check regularly (should match the one we have)
      * Phone number
      * Your birthdate
   1. <p><strong>Choose some flight options:</strong></p><p>There are lots of websites for finding flights ([[http://www.hipmunk.com Hipmunk]], [[http://www.kayak.com Kayak]], [[http://www.expedia.com Expedia]], individual airlines) — use them to look for (*but not purchase*) flight options. Pick 1–3 options that work for you and, ideally, cost less than $450. For each flight segment, note the date, airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, and departure and arrival airports. If you like, use standard abbreviations (Madison is “MSN” = Dane County Regional Airport):</p><pre class="screen">24 Jun (Sun), United 1122, depart 7:16am BWI, arrive  8:18am ORD
24 Jun (Sun), United 5981, depart 9:45am ORD, arrive 10:35am MSN
...</pre><p>If you are listing more than one option, please list complete round-trip sets of flight segments, and clearly mark your favorite choice.</p>
   1. <p><strong>Email your choices:</strong></p><p>Email to [[mailto:cathy@cs.wisc.edu Cathy Richard]] and CC [[mailto:gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org gridschool-2012-info@opensciencegrid.org]]. Include your personal information and flight options. If Cathy has questions, she will contact you directly. When your flight arrangements are complete, she will send you all of the final details, including the confirmation and ticket numbers.

---++++ Bus or Train (or Both)

As with airline tickets, consider both schedule and cost; we budgeted $450 for your travel. Typically, reasonable bus and train options cost much less than air options.

If you are buying bus or train tickets ahead of time, we *may* be able to buy them for you. Otherwise, you can purchase the ticket(s) yourself and then request reimbursement. To have us purchase tickets for you, follow the instructions for Travel by Airplane, above; that is, gather personal information, choose some options, and send us (Cathy and the list) your choices. If Cathy cannot purchase the tickets, she will let you know.

If you purchase your own tickets or otherwise make your own arrangements, email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:
   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison
   * Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)

---++++ Personal Car

If you are driving to Madison, we will reimburse you the standard government rate for mileage (as calculated by Google Maps) and tolls. Also, we may be able to reimburse you for parking costs in Madison. Keep your receipts for all driving-related expenses!

Once you have made your plans, email them to us as soon as possible. Try to include:
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Estimated round-trip mileage

---+++ You Are Paying for Your Travel

If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday and depart on Friday (or else check with us first about the hotel).

Once you have made your plans, email them to us as soon as possible. Try to include:
   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)
