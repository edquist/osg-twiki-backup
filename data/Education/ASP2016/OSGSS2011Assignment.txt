---+ 2011 OSG Summer School Final Assignment

The School focused on running large-scale distributed computing applications to support and even transform scientific inquiry. We want you to tell us about an interesting science project that (a) you are or might be involved in, and (b) has significant computational needs. The purpose of this exercise is twofold: We want to know a bit about what you learned at the Summer School, and we are very much interested in the sorts of projects that will require you to apply your new knowledge.

The first step is to pick a project to describe. Ideally, the project is one that you (and/or your team) is working on now or will work on soon. While it needs to be a project that has large-scale computing requirements, it should come from your own domain area: physics, biology, ecology, agronomy, etc. If you are a computer scientist and you do not have a computing project of your own, you will have to find a coworker, colleague, or other faculty/staff member who can tell you about a project; this will mean extra work for you, but perhaps will turn into an interesting collaboration.

Next, think about what you learned during the School and about the project itself. Spend some time figuring out how you would approach the computational needs of the project using local high-throughput computing resources and/or the Open Science Grid. We are not asking you to implement the project! Just imagine how you would do it. Maybe you will think of one approach to try, maybe you will think of many possible approaches. Imagine that you will run on the resources available to you at your own institution. If your institution does not have a HTC system available, then think about what kind of resources you would want or how you could get access to resources via the OSG.

Your final assignment can be a poster for TG’11 or a written report (see below for more detail). It should be organized roughly as follows:

   * The science challenge (about 1/3 of the assignment) — at a level we can all understand
      * What science do you work on?
      * What specific challenge do you (want to) work on?
      * Why does that work require significant computing resources to solve?
   * The computational plan (about 2/3 of the assignment)
      * Estimate the resources (CPUs, time, memory, disk, network, etc.) that you need
      * Describe in some detail your plan or proposal to use computing tools to work on your challenge (more than one plan is OK)

There are many possible questions your paper could address. Below are some suggestions — feel free to answer some (or all) of them, or create and answer your own interesting questions:

   * What local resources do you have access to?
   * Would you use just local resources or do you need remote resources, too?
   * How would you turn your project into actual jobs?
   * What are the resource needs of the jobs themselves?
   * What sort of workflow, if any, would you use? Are there manual steps in your overall workflow? Could they be automated (e.g., with DAGMan)?
   * How would you find and select remote resources? Or do you have access to a GlideinWMS system?
   * How much data do you need to move around? Which type of data situation do you have? What is your plan for data management?
   * Do you think your project is better suited for HTC or HPC? Why?
   * What security concerns do you have with your project? Do you need to do anything special regarding security?

This is not a formal paper for submission to a conference or journal, so organize it as you wish. However, please strive to represent yourself and your project well, as we may share your work with colleagues (yours and ours), others in the field, and with funding agencies who may support future summer schools.

Please complete the assignment no later than August 31st, 2010, but we strongly encourage you to complete it before TG’10. When you are done, email us a PDF of your completed paper. Later, we may ask for the original text, if we decide to compile all of the papers or samples from them.

If you have any questions or comments about this assignment, email Tim or Alain (directly or via the mailing lists you used already), or contact your mentor.

Write how you will apply what your learned this week to your science/computational problem.

Due Date:  July 31, 2011

Submit to: Tim Cartwright (cat@cs.wisc.edu) copy to your Mentor

---+++ Option 1: Poster for TG’11

You can also create a poster for TG11 to fulfill the assignment.

Notification: Email Laura !McGinnis (lfm@psc.edu) by July 8th if want to provide a poster, copy to Tim, Jim, and your Mentor.

Due: Bring Poster to TG11 for display in the Tuesday July 19th Poster Session/Viz Gallery Reception.

Requirements: No larger than 4' by 4'

---+++ Option 2: Written Report

Now that you have a plan, tell us about it. Write a short paper, maybe 500–1000 words or so (a little more is fine) about:
