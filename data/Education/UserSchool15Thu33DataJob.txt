----+  Stash-public to worker node

In the above example (Exercise 2.2), we assumed you and/or your collaborator are fine with shelling out project money on AWS server. However, it is likely that doing a large amount of data transfer with AWS is not good for budget reasons. So we want to utilize the public webservice on OSG connect.


The example files are located under the directory ==namd-ct-stash==.

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd namd-condor/namd-ct-stash </strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>ls </strong>
</pre>


<pre class="file">
namd_run.sh    # Job wrapper script to execute namd job
</pre>
We see only one file. The input files are located at http://stash.osgconnect.net/+dbala/Storage/namd-input-files. Note that the condor job submission file is missing. Prepare the condor job submit file and launch the job.
