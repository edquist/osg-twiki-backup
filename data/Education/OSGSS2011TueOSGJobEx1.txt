---+ OSG Exercises

This exercise will give you some experience submitting directly into OSG.

%TOC%

---++ Environment

We will use the usual Condor submit host:<br>
=vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu=

There will be no shared file system between the submit and the execute hosts, so you will should plan on transferring all the needed files with you.

---++ Exercise 1 - Basic job submission

Try submitting a simple "who am I" job, as explained the the exercise [[OSGSS2011TueDHTCEx1#Exercise_2_Condor_G][ we did this morning]].

Try jobmanager-fork.

Try using directly the [[GlobusToolsOss2010][Globus tools]].

Check where your job runs and which user are you running under.

---++ Exercise 2 - Find other sites

As said during the lecture, OSG provides an  information system called [[http://is.grid.iu.edu/documentation.html][BDII]]. 

The tool to talk to the BDII is [[http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/CDS/ag/8.0/Finding_Directory_Entries-Using_ldapsearch.html][ldapsearch]]. The complete command to talk to the OSG BDII is:
<pre style="margin-left:4em" class="screen">
/opt/osg-client/openldap/bin/ldapsearch -h is.grid.iu.edu -p2170
</pre>

To find out all the sites that claim to support our OSGEDU VO, you sould use the following search expression:
<pre style="margin-left:4em" class="screen">
-b 'mds-vo-name=local,o=grid' 'GlueCEAccessControlBaseRule=VO:osgedu'
</pre>

What do you see?
