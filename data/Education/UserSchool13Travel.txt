---+ Travel To and From Madison

Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, email us with your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here and can plan accurately.

Find the subsection below that applies to you:

---++ 1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel

*PLEASE NOTE: If we offered to pay for your travel, you will need to arrange it through Chris Battistuz (no matter the method of transportation), who can be contacted at [[mailto:xsedetravel@sdsc.edu xsedetravel@sdsc.edu]].  Please CC: [[mailto:osg-school-2013-info@opensciencegrid.org osg-school-2013-info@opensciencegrid.org]] on all travel emails.*

Our travel budget is *very limited* this year. We budgeted an average of $475 per student for travel to and from Madison, and there are no extra travel funds. If you can travel for less than $475, that is awesome! If not, contact us immediately, and we will work together to find a good option.

Please search for the most cost-effective (yet reasonable) means to get to Madison. Here are a few ideas:

   * Instead of flying, consider driving or taking a bus or train; we can support *all* kinds of travel
   * If you must fly, look aggressively for low airfares and any special deals
   * Consider flying into Milwaukee (1&frac12; hours away) or Chicago (2&frac12; hours away) and taking a bus to/from Madison (details below)
   * Even though we offered to pay for your travel, if there is any way you can get travel funding, please do so and let us know right away!

In any case, try to make your travel plans by May 17th (5 weeks before School), before rates go up significantly.

See below for details about each travel mode:

---+++ Travel by Airplane

<span style="color: #f60;">Do NOT buy your own airline tickets!</span> Chris Battistuz (at the University of California San Diego) will buy the tickets for you.

To arrange flights to/from Madison:

   1. <p><strong>Gather personal information:</strong></p>
      * Your name, to put on ticket (should match your official ID)
      * Email address that you check regularly (should match the one we have)
      * Social Security Number or U.S. visa information
      * Telephone number
      * Your birthdate
      * Mailing address where reimbursement should be sent

   2. <p><strong>Choose your preferred itineraries:</strong></p>There are lots of websites for finding flights — [[http://www.hipmunk.com Hipmunk]], [[http://www.kayak.com Kayak]], [[http://www.expedia.com Expedia]], individual airlines missed by search sites ([[http://www.southwest.com Southwest Airlines]]), etc. — use them to look for (<span style="color: #f60;">but not purchase</span>) flight options. Pick 1–3 options that work for you and, ideally, cost less than $475. For each flight segment, note the date, airline, flight number, departure and arrival times, and departure and arrival airports. If you like, use standard abbreviations (Madison is “MSN” = Dane County Regional Airport):</p><pre class="screen">23 Jun (Sun), United 1122, depart 7:16am BWI, arrive  8:18am ORD
23 Jun (Sun), United 5981, depart 9:45am ORD, arrive 10:35am MSN
...</pre><p>If you send us more than one itinerary, list complete round-trip sets of flight segments, and clearly rank your choices.</p><p>Do not forget to check air itineraries to/from Milwaukee or Chicago, taking a bus from the airport directly to Madison:</p>
      * Bus between [[http://www.mitchellairport.com][Mitchell Airport]] (MKE) in Milwaukee and downtown Madison: [[http://www.badgerbus.com/][Badger Bus]]
      * Bus between [[http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/en/home/][O’Hare Airport]] (ORD) in Chicago and downtown Madison: [[http://www.coachusa.com/vangalder/][Van Galder Bus]]
      * Bus between [[http://www.flychicago.com/midway/en/home/][Midway Airport]] (MDW) in Chicago and downtown Madison: [[http://www.coachusa.com/vangalder/][Van Galder Bus]]
   3. <p><strong>Email your choices to UCSD:</strong></p> [[mailto:xsedetravel@sdsc.edu xsedetravel@sdsc.edu]] and CC [[mailto:osg-school-2013-info@opensciencegrid.org osg-school-2013-info@opensciencegrid.org]]. Include itineraries for your top travel options in the email.</p>
   4. <p><strong>Speak with UCSD about the tickets:</strong></p>The UCSD team (probably Chris himself) will reply to your email to set up a day and time for a phone call. On this call, you will be asked to give personally identifiable information (e.g., name, birthdate, Social Security Number if applicable or else visa information). UCSD requires this information to purchase your ticket or reimburse you for expenses. We all respect your privacy and will ask only for information that is required and will handle all information carefully. <span style="color: #f60;">For your own security, do not send sensitive information (e.g., Social Security Number) by email!</span> That is why UCSD will set up a phone call with you. Then, UCSD will then purchase your tickets and send you the final itinerary.</p>

*Note:* Have us buy your airline tickets now, but buy your own bus tickets right at the airport on the day of travel (see next section).

---+++ Travel by Bus and/or Train

Typically, reasonable bus and train options — i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison — cost much less than air options.

Note that you must purchase all bus and train tickets yourself, ahead of time or on the day of travel, then request reimbursement from UCSD after the School. You must get approval for the purchase price (or a good estimate) from us before buying the tickets.

When you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email), which should include:

   * Complete itinerary
   * Your name
   * Date of purchase
   * Total amount paid

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison
   * Actual or estimated cost (indicate which)

---+++ Travel by Personal Car

If you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.565/mile for the round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we may be able to reimburse you for parking costs in Madison. Keep your receipts for tolls and parking (in Madison)!

*Note: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We will limit your total driving reimbursement to $475 (same as airfare), but talk to us about the details. Plus, if another method of travel (air, bus, train) is less expensive than driving, please use that other option if at all possible.*

To travel by personal car, please check with us first. We will ask you for a quote or two from other travel methods (e.g., air), to make sure that driving is indeed the least expensive method.

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Estimated round-trip mileage

---++ 2. You Are Paying for Your Travel

If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday and depart on Friday (or else check with us first about the hotel).

Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:

   * Transportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)
   * Arrival date and approximate time
   * Departure date and approximate time
   * Arrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)
