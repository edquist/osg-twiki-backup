Diagram of the current system configuration:

	 <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Systems_2005-V3.jpg" alt="Lab System Configuration V3"  width="727" height="890"  />

The machine gk1 (206.76.233.104) will act as the client machine.  All users will log on to that machine.  It is also configured as a Condor submit node.  I have the gk2 (206.76.233.105) setup as the Condor central manager and clu1 (206.76.233.106) is working as the execute machine.  Right now, clu1 has 100 virtual CPU's configured - probably a bit of overkill but it was fun to do...

I have been able to submit a condor job from my account on gk1 and it actually worked.  I have also been able to GridFTP around the various machines and I have done a couple of very simple GRAM jobs using globusrun.  So, the basics seem to be there.

If others want to start getting on the machines and playing around I think now would be the time.  That way we can start working out configuration issues.

The fourth machine clu2 (206.76.233.107) is setup with GT 4.  I have not done much configuration to that machine since I don't know what will be needed.  I did start up the globus container and submit a simple WS-GRAM job right after things were installed.  However, that has been about it.

The machines gk1, gk2, and clu1 are running VDT 1.3.6.  This is located in /opt/vdt.  When you log on, remember to run 'source /opt/vdt/setup.sh', you will also need certificates.

clu2 has the NMI stack installed.  Globus is located at /usr/local/globus.  You will need to set export:
<verbatim>
JAVA_HOME=/opt/vdt/jdk1.4
export ANT_HOME=/usr/local/apache-ant-1.6.4
export GPT_LOCATION=/usr/local/gpt
export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus

PATH=$ANT_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH:$HOME/bin
</verbatim>

and then:

<verbatim>
source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh
</verbatim>

Again, you will also need certificates.
