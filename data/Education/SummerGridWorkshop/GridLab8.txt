<h1>Student notes for VDS tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
 
<p>These are the student notes for the VDS tutorial at South Padre Island in 2006. They
are designed to be used in conjunction with instructor presentation and
support.</p>

<p>The tutorial is structured as four chapters of 45 minutes each. Each
chapter will consist of a presentation by the instructors, and then 
time to work on the exercises in this file.</p>

<p>You will see two styles of machine text here:</p>
<pre class="in transcript">Text like this is input that you should type.</pre>
<pre class="out transcript">Text like this is the output you should get.</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<p class="transcript">
<code><span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">date</span><br />
<span class="out">Wed May 31 11:54:58 BST 2006</span></code>
</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: Basic usage</h2>

<p>The exercises in this chapter will familiarize you with basic use
of the VDS and with the physics example code that we will be using in
later exercises.</p>

<p>Files used:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>/opt/QuarkCode</code> - contains simple physics application in PERL</li>
<li><code>/opt/QuarkCode/sites.xml</code> - the <em>site catalog</em></li>
<li><code>/opt/QuarkCode/tc.data</code> - the <em>transformation catalog</em></li>

<li><code>BIGGERVDL	 PROBINTRO	 SIMPLEVDL	 VDLINTRO COMPOUNDVDL</code> - exercises
</ul>


<h3>Exercise 1.1: VDLINTRO</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you will use the VDL tools to generate a very simple
'Hello World' message.</p>


<p>You need some setup files for VDS (vdsrc and wfrc), and then one exercise file.</p>

<p>Set up VDS by copying in a vdsrc and a wfrc from the example provided:</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp /opt/vdltut/vdsrc ~/.vdsrc</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp /opt/vdltut/wfrc ~/.wfrc</span>
</pre>

<p>Now edit <code>~/.vdsrc</code> so that the <code>dir.storage</code> and <code>dir.exec</code> refer to your user number instead of <code>USERXX</code>.
</p>

<p>VDS should now be configured. You can try it by running a helloworld workflow, as follows.</p>

<p>Copy the file into a working directory:

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd ~</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">mkdir VDLINTRO</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd VDLINTRO</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp /opt/vdltut/VDLINTRO/helloworld.vdl .</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">helloworld.vdl</span>
</pre>

<p><code>helloworld.vdl</code> is a VDL (Virtual Data Language file) which
defines one <em>transformation</em> (like a function definition), and one
<em>derivation</em> (like a function call). <br />
The transformation defined here takes a message and outputs it to a file.<br />
The derivation defined here calls this transformation, with a specific
message (hello world!) and a specific output file.</p>

<p>The first step in running helloworld is to compile the VDL file into an
<em>abstract DAG</em> (or <em>DAX</em>). Use the vdlc command for this:</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">vdlc helloworld.vdl </span>
<span class="out">20060531T145705.890: [app] using label "helloworld"
20060531T145705.891: [app] using output file "helloworld.dax"</span>
</pre>

<p>An abstract DAG has been generated and output in XML format into 
<code>helloworld.dax</code>. Open <code>helloworld.dax</code> in a file
viewer:</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cat helloworld.dax</span>
</pre>

<p>Inside the DAX, you should see three sections.
<ol>
<li>list of all referenced files - this shows the input and output files 
used by this workflow. In this case, there is only one file, the output 
file <code>greeting.txt</code>.
</li>

<li>definition of all jobs - each job in the workflow. In this exercise,
there is only one. The derivation specified in the VDL file has been converted
into a single &lt;job&gt; element in the DAX.</li>

<li>list of control-flow dependencies - this section specifies a partial
order in which jobs are to executed. As there is only one job in this 
DAX, there is nothing here. In later exercises, you will see more 
information here.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Now that you have your abstract DAG, you can run it through the 
<em>planner</em> to generate a plan for the workflow, using the
<code>vds-plan</code> command.
</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">vds-plan --pegasus -g QuarkCode --option pools=local --option output=local --option force helloworld.dax --base ./dags</span>
[...many lines of output...]
<span class="out">

I have concretized your abstract workflow. The workflow has been entered
into the workflow database with a state of "planned". The next step is 
to start or execute your workflow. The invocation required is

vds-run  /home/trainXX/VDLINTRO/dags/QuarkCode/helloworld/run0007
</span>
</pre>

<p>The workflow has been planned. You can start it running by typing the
command shown in the above output (note that the numbers will probably be
different for you).</p>

<p>You can start it running using the <code>vds-run</code> 
command:</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">vds-run  /home/trainXX/VDLINTRO/dags/QuarkCode/helloworld/run0007</span>

<p>You can monitor which jobs are running using the <code>condor_q</code> 
command and by watching the jobstate log.</p>

<pre class="transcript">

<span class="out">1150052758 INTERNAL *** DAGMAN_FINISHED ***

</pre>

<p>You will know when your job is completed when the 
<code>TAILSTATD_FINISHED</code> message appears. If something has gone 
wrong, you might see an error message instead.</p>

<p>When you job has completed, you can examine the results as follows.
You will need to substitute your user number in twice, and the run number
that you used above. Replace 2 below with your user number and 0005 with the
run number.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cat /scratch/train</span>02<span class="in">/QuarkCode/train</span>2<span class="in">/helloworld/run</span>0005<span class="in">/greeting.txt</span>
<span class="out">Hello World</span>
</pre>

<p>and now you can see the greeting.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cat greeting.txt</span>
<span class="out">Hello World</span>
</pre>

<p>Congratulations! You've run your first VDL workflow.</p>



<h3>Exercise 1.2: PROBINTRO</h3>

<p>This exercise introduces the physics example code, taken from 
QuarkNet. You will run some of the code by hand to analyse data
and plot it on a graph. In later exercises, you will run the 
same code but in other ways, taking advantage of VDS.</p>

<p>The QuarkNet code is written in PERL and kept in the <code>
/opt/QuarkCode/</code>
directory.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">ls /opt/QuarkCode/</span>
<span class="out">Combine.pl		  Flux.pl			  Plot.pl			  Split.pl 
CommonSubs.pl	  Frequency.pl		RawAnalyze.pl	  ThresholdTimes.pl 
EventChoice.pl	 Getopt				ShowerArgs.pl	  WireDelay.pl 
EventSearch.pl	 Lifetime.pl		 SingleChannel.pl  gps_data.pl 
ExtraFunctions.pl Math				  Sort.pl</span></pre>

<p>The data files which will be analysed have been collected from cosmic
ray detectors at various sites around the US. Some of that is available in
the <code>Data/</code> subdirectory.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">ls /opt/vdltut/Data/</span>
<span class="out">180

180.2004.0819.1.raw.meta</span>
[...]
</pre>

<p>The commands to run are in the <code>/opt/vdltut/PROBINTRO/</code> subdirectory, 
in a shell script called <code>manual.sh</code>.  You can run the whole
analysis by executing that shell script.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">mkdir ~/PROBINTRO</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd ~/PROBINTRO</span>

<span class="out">min max step num bin 0.01050 9.53400 0.95235 |10|10|

</pre>

<p>The output graph is in plot.png. In addition, several intermediate files
have been created - each step in the analysis created intermediate files
that were then used by later steps.
</p>

<p>To view the plot, you can scp <code>plot.png</code> to your
local machine and view it:</p>

<p>NOTE: TYPE THIS BIT ON YOUR LOCAL LAPTOP, NOT ON GRIDLAB</p>

</pre>

<h2>Chapter 2: More advanced VDL</h2>
<p>In this chapter you will be introduced to more advanced VDL usage.</p.

<h3>Exercise 2.1: SIMPLEVDL</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you will write your own VDL to run one step in the
QuarkNet problem code, which takes the processed data and generates a graph.
</p>

<p>You are provided with
 <ul> <li>the input data files for this step, <code>simplevdl-extra</code> and
			 <code>simplevdl-freqs</code> (these are the same as 
			 some of the intermediate files that were generated in your
			 <code>PROBINTRO/</code> 
			 directory). These have already been registered with the replica
			 location system (which you will see in greater depth in a later
			 exercise)</li>

		<li>a transformation definition that defines how to use Plot.pl from 
			 the <code>QuarkCode/</code> directory to convert input data 
			 files into a graph, in <code>transform.vdl</code>.</li>
		<li>a template file <code>simple.vdl.template</code> for the derivation.</ul>
</p>

<p>Armed with these tools, you will need to write a derivation which 
	uses the supplied transformation on the supplied data files to produce
	the output graph.</p>
			
<p>Instructions:
<ul>
  <li>copy the SIMPLEVDL/ directory into your workspace, and use the supplied template to make a <code>simple.vdl</code> file<br />

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp -av /opt/vdltut/SIMPLEVDL ~</span>

<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd ~/SIMPLEVDL/</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp simple.vdl.template simple.vdl</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">vi simple.vdl </span> (or editor of your choosing)

</pre>
</li>
<li>In the last step using vi, modify the derivation so that @USER@ is replaced with <code>trainXX</code> in all three places that it occurs.
</li>

<li>Now try compiling, planning and running your workflow:

<h3>Exercise 2.2: BIGGERVDL</h3>

<p>In this exercise, you will expand the VDL used in the SIMPLEVDL exercise
to include everything necessary to run the whole problem code (as seen in 
the PROBINTRO exercise).</p>

<p>We introduce several more transformations, and make derivations to 
process the raw input data into a graph.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2.3: COMPOUNDVDL</h3>  

<p>In this exercise, you will combine the transforms of the previous
BIGGERVDL exercise into a single compound transform. When you have 
done this, you will be able to invoke the entire analysis process using 
a single derivation.
</p>

<p>The files for this exercise are in the <code>/opt/vdltut/COMPOUNDVDL/</code>
directory.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp -av /opt/vdltut/COMPOUNDVDL/ ~</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd ~/COMPOUNDVDL/ ~</span>

<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">ls</span>
<span class="out">compound.vdl.template  transformations.vdl</span>
</pre>

<p>The most interesting file here is <code>compound.vdl</code>. This 
takes the various different transformations that we did separately in 
the previous exercise, and makes a single transform. Then instead of specifying 
many derivations, we can specify just a 
single derivation to run the whole analysis.</p>

<p>Copy the <code>compound.vdl.template</code> template file, and substitute in @USER@ at each occurence.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp compound.vdl.template compound.vdl</span>
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">vim compound.vdl</span>

20060531T121630.011: [app] using output file "compound.dax"</span>
</pre>

<p>At this point, a file called <code>compound.dax</code> should have 
been generated. Look inside and see that it is very similar to
<code>biggervdl.dax</code>, the DAX file from the BIGGERVDL exercise.
</p>

<p>Now plan and run the workflow:</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: Using Pegasus</h2>

<p>In this chapter you will be introduced to some more of the commands needed to set up a workflow. For previous exercises, these were done for you by the instructors.</p>

<p> All the exercises in this Chapter will be run from the ~/COMPOUNDVL/
directory. All the files that are required reside in this sub
directory </p>  

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd ~/COMPOUNDVDL</span>

<h3>Exercise 3.1 SETTING UP THE REPLICA CATALOG (RLS)</h3>
<p>In this exercise you will insert entries into the Replica Catalog.
The replica catalog that we use is GLOBUS RLS. </p>

<p> A Replica Catalog maintains the lfn to pfn mapping for the input
files of your workflow. Pegasus queries it to determine the locations
of the raw input data files required by the workflow. Additionally,
all the materialized data is registered into RLS for data reuse later
on.  </p>

<p>You can use the <code>rc-client</code> command to insert, query
and delete from the replica catalog.</p>

<p>The input data to be used for your workflow resides in the
$HOME/Data directory. We are going to insert entries into the replica
catalog that point to the files in this directory.</p>


<p>The instructors have provided a replicas.in.template, the input data file
 for the rc-client that  contains the mappings that need to be
 populated in the RLS.</li> 
 </ul>
</p>
	  

<p>You will need to write some things yourself, by following the instructions
below:
<ul>

<li>Copy the template file to a file (replicas.in) in the COMPOUND subdirectory.</li>
<li>Do @USER@ substitution on the copied file. Replace @USER@ with your
username of the form train99</li>

<p> Congratulations!! You have the replica catalog setup correctly for
use. This is the catalog which you will tinker with most, while
running Pegasus.</p>


<h3>Exercise 3.2 SETTING UP THE SITE CATALOG AND THE TRANSFORMATION</h3>
<p>In this exercise you will setup your Site Catalog and the
Transformation Catalog.</p>

<p>The transformation catalog maintains information about where the
application code resides on the grid. In our case, it contains the
locations where the QuarkCode is installed on the various Teragrid
sites.</p>

<p> The site catalog contains information about the layout of your
grid where you want to run your workflows. In our case it contains
site information about the various Teragrid sites. For each site
information like workdirectories, jobmanagers to use, gridftp servers
to use and other site wide information like environment variables to
be set is maintained.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the <code>vds-get-sites</code> command to generate a
site catalog and a transformation catalog to be used.

</ul>
</p>

<p>The instructors have provided:
 <ul> <li> A ready site catalog(sites.xml) in the
 $HOME directory.</li> 
 <li> A ready transformation catalog (tc.data) in the
 $HOME directory.
 </ul>
</p>
	  
<p>You can look at them to have an idea as to what they look like. But
for now we will move ahead and plan your workflow through Pegasus. 
</p>

 <h3>Exercise 3.3 Tracking the progress of the workflow and debugging
 the workflows.</h3>

<p>In this exercise we are going to list ways to track your workflow,
and give some debugging hints when something goes wrong.
</p>

<p>We will change into the directory, that was mentioned by the
vds-run command.</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cd /nfs/home/@USER@/tutorial/master/PEGASUS/dags/ivdgl1/QuarkCode/run000X</span>
</pre>

<p>In this directory you will see a whole lot of files. That should
not scare you. Unless things go wrong, you need to look at just a very
few number of files to track the progress of the workflow</p>

<p>At the first go you should be concerned with only one file</p>
<ul>
 <li>
 jobstate.log
 </p> This is the output file of the monitoring daemon that is parsing
 all the condor log files to determine the status of the
 jobs. It logs the events seen by Condor into a more readable form for
 us.
 </p>

 <pre class="transcript">
 <span class="out">$</span><span class="in">more jobstate.log</span>
 <span class="out">1149911774 INTERNAL *** TAILSTATD_STARTED ***</span>
 <span class="out">1149911773 INTERNAL *** DAGMAN_STARTED ***</span>
 <span class="out">1149911773 QuarkCode_0_pegasus_concat UN_READY - - -</span>
 <span class="out">1149911773 Plot_ID000008 UN_READY - - -</span>
 <span class="out">1149911773 Lifetime_ID000005 UN_READY - - -</span>

 <span class="out">1149911773 rc_tx_WireDelay_ID000002_0 UN_READY - - -</span>
 <span class="out">[..]</span>
 </pre>

 <p>
 In the starting of the jobstate.log, when the workflow has just
 started running you will see a lot of entries with status
 UN_READY. That designates that DAGMan has just parsed in the .dag
 file and has not started working on any job as yet. Initially all the
 jobs in the workflow are listed as UN_READY
 </p>


 <p> After sometime you will see entries in jobstate.log, that shows a
 job is being executed etc </p>

 <pre class="transcript">
 <span class="out">1149911774 QuarkCode_0_isi_skynet_cdir SUBMIT 264.0 isi_skynet -</span>
 <span class="out">1149911789 QuarkCode_0_isi_skynet_cdir EXECUTE 264.0 isi_skynet -</span>
 <span class="out">1149911789 QuarkCode_0_isi_skynet_cdir GLOBUS_SUBMIT 264.0 isi_skynet -</span>
 <span class="out">1149911789 QuarkCode_0_isi_skynet_cdir GRID_SUBMIT 264.0 isi_skynet -</span>

 <span class="out">1149911799 QuarkCode_0_isi_skynet_cdir POST_SCRIPT_TERMINATED 264.0 isi_skynet -</span>
 <span class="out">1149911799 QuarkCode_0_isi_skynet_cdir POST_SCRIPT_SUCCESS - isi_skynet -</span>
 </pre>

 <p>
 The above shows the create dir job being submitted and then executed
 on the grid. In addition it lists that job is being run on the grid
 site <code>isi_skynet</code> The various states of the job while it
 goes through submission to execution to postprocessing are in UPPERCASE.
 <p>

 </li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p> To see which job of yours is being executed, you can also use
condor_q. By default condor_q list all the jobs on the submit
host. However, we are just interested in our own respective jobs. So
we will use some classad magic to narrow the results.</p>

<p> Run command <b> condor_q -const '(Owner == "@USUER@")'</b> with
@USER@ replaced by the username.

 <pre class="transcript">
 <span class="out">$</span> condor_q -const '(Owner == "vdsuser-4")'</span>
 <span class="out">252.0	vdsuser-4		 6/9  17:04	0+00:11:21 R  0	9.8  condor_dagman -f -</span>
 <span class="out">260.0	vdsuser-4		 6/9  17:15	0+00:00:00 I  0	9.8  kickstart -n Quark</span>
 </pre>

 <p> The above indicates that currently we have two jobs running</p>
 <br/>

 <p>
 Keep a lookout on the condor_q to track whether a workflow is running
 or not. If you do not see any of your job in the condor_q for
 sometime (say 30 seconds), we know the workflow has finished. We need
 to wait, as there might be delay in CondorDAGMAN releasing the next
 job into the queue after a job has finished successfully.</p>


 <p>If condor_q is empty, then either your workflow has </br>
	  - successfully completed</br>
	  - stopped midway due to non recoverable error</br>
 </p>


 <ul>
 <li> Successfully Completed
 <p> Let us again look at the jobstate.log. This time we need to look
 at the last few lines of jobstate.log</p>

 <pre class="transcript">
 <span class="out">$</span> tail jobstate.log</span>
 <span class="out">1149894263 new_rc_tx_Plot_ID000008_0 POST_SCRIPT_TERMINATED 248.0 local -</span>

 <span class="out">1149894273 INTERNAL *** DAGMAN_FINISHED ***</span>
 <span class="out">1149894274 INTERNAL *** TAILSTATD_FINISHED 0 ***</span>
 </pre>

 <p>
 Looking at the last two lines we see that DAGMAN finshed, and
 tailstatd finished successfully with a status 0. This means workflow
 ran successfully. Congratulations you ran your workflow on the grid successfully.
 </p>

 <p>
 The output plot generated by the workflow is <code>.png file</code> that resides
 in the directory <b>/nfs/storage01/trainXX/vdsuser-Y_plot.png</b> where
 XX is the 2 digit version of Y.  for e.g if user is vdsuser-4 then
 the path will be /nfs/storage01/train04/vdsuser-4_plot.png
 </p>
 <p>To view the plot, you can copy <code>vdsuser-Y_plot.png</code> to your
skynet webspace, and view it in your web browser:</p>

<pre class="transcript">
<span class="out">$</span> <span class="in">cp /nfs/storage01/train04/vdsuser-4_plot.png ~/public_html/newplot.png</span>
<span class="out">$</span> 
</span>
</pre>
<p>Point your web browser to:
http://skynet-login.isi.edu/~@USER@/newplot.png where @USER@ is your
userid</p> 
</li>

<li> Unsuccessfully Completed (Workflow execution stopped midway)
 <p> Let us again look at the jobstate.log. Again we need to look
 at the last few lines of jobstate.log</p>

 <pre class="transcript">
 <span class="out">$</span> tail jobstate.log</span>
 <span class="out">1149912756 Frequency_ID000006 SUBMIT 277.0 isi_skynet -</span>

 <span class="out">1149912901 Frequency_ID000006 POST_SCRIPT_STARTED - isi_skynet -</span>
 <span class="out">1149912906 Frequency_ID000006 POST_SCRIPT_TERMINATED 277.0 isi_skynet -</span>

 <span class="out">1149912906 INTERNAL *** DAGMAN_FINISHED ***</span>
 <span class="out">1149912911 INTERNAL *** TAILSTATD_FINISHED 1 ***</span>
 </pre>

  <p>
 Looking at the last two lines we see that DAGMAN finshed, and
 tailstatd finished unsuccessfully with a status 1.
 </p>

 <p>
 We can easily determine which job failed. It is Frequency_ID000006 in
 this case.<br/>
 To determine the reason for failure we need to look at
 it's kickstart output file which is $JOBNAME.out i.e
 <a href="http://skynet-login.isi.edu/~vdsuser-4/Frequency_ID000006.out">Frequency_ID000006.out</a>
 <br/>
 Looking at it's output we see it failed because of a perl library not
 installed on isi_skynet!.
 </p>

 <p>
  We correct that and submit the workflow again.
  </p>

 </li>
 </ul>

The End
