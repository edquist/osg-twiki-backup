---+ OSG Connect Sign-up Instructions
In order to participate in the OSG Connect exercises on Tuesday afternoon, you'll need to sign up for an OSG Connect account. Registrations are manually approved, so we would like you to sign up ahead of time. 

   *  *Step 1* Visit the OSG Connect sign up page ( https://osgconnect.net/signup)  and click on the Continue button. This takes you to a page which will let you create a Globus ID or log in if you already have one. 
     
   *  *Step 2* After you have signed in or created a Globus ID, you will be asked to link an existing account or continue with the current Globus account. Click on the No Thanks, continue button to continue the application process 
     
   *  *Step 3* To complete your sign up, submit an application to join the osg group. It is important that you *choose your Globus ID in the username dropdown menu*. (If not sure, take a close look at  Figure.3  in the OSG Connect sign up page)
    
In the next few minutes, you should get an automated email message that acknowledges the receipt of your application.
