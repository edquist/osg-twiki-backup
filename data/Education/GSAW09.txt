[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]] (OSG),  [[http://www.clemson.edu][Clemson University]]  and the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] present a two day training course in grid installation. 

---+++ %RED% *>>> [[GSAW2009Syllabus][Grid school programme]] >>>* %ENDCOLOR%

[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science Grid]]  (OSG), a major national grid infrastructure, provides scientists with more than 70 production sites offering over 20,000 CPUs and 4 Petabytes of storage to advance their research. This organization supports cutting edge interdisciplinary computational research in areas such as high energy physics, astrophysics, bioinformatics, gravitational-wave science and computer science. <br>

The OSG infrastructure relies on the deployment of the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) software stack and the goal of this workshop is on training participants as new grid site administrators through hands-on sessions covering installation and maintenance of large-scale grid computing resources.
The lectures and practical sessions will take the participant through all the steps involved in setting up and validating the VDT. <br>

The workshop will consist of a sequence of lectures followed by hands-on sessions covering various technical
topics of interest to grid site administrators, such as:

   * OSG Fundamentals
   * Installation of OSG services
      * Installing and configuration of Compute Elements and Storage Elements
      * Generating and installing service certificates  
      * Setting up authentication mechanisms
      * Dealing with Virtual Organizations

   * Validation of the install
      * Testing grid job submisions
      * Mechanisms available for continuous validation (probes)

   * Security concepts and practices 
   * Trash/Troubleshooting tools
   

*Target audience:* <br>

Participants should have extended experience as system administrators, strong Unix knowledge,
and should already be involved or plan to be involved in a grid computing project shortly after the workshop.
