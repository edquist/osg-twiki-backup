---+ 2011 OSG Summer School Teleconference

---++ Goal
We are holding a teleconference meeting with the students and mentors to continue our relationship, encourage/assist with use of HTC, and discuss other items of interest.

---++ Logistics
   * Date: Tuesday, October 18, 2011
   * Time: 2:30-4:00 PM CDT
   * Number: 866-740-1260  code: 8402687# 

---++ Agenda
   * Introduction
   * Each Mentor cover his activities
   * Each Student takes ~2 minutes to say what he/she has been doing, especially any work with HTC applications
   * Discussion/Summary

---++ Reports
---+++ Attendance
Mentors: Alain Roy, Tim Cartwright, Zach Miller, Jim Weichel    Missing: Brian Bockelman (at CERN) and Igor Sfiligoi

Students: Julio Goez, Yasi Khorramzadeh, Ray Sehgal, Igor Senderovich, Javier Tabima
International Students attempted to join via the web: Eduardo Bach, Diego Rincon

---+++ Mentor Reports
%BLUE%Alain Roy%ENDCOLOR% has been helping 2 students get them access to OSG via the Engage VO.

%BLUE%Jim Weichel%ENDCOLOR% worked (via email) with all 4 students on final papers which have all been submitted and approved.  (Papers can be viewed on the [[OSGSS2011Assignment][Final Assignment Page]].)  Based on final papers, some will be working with HTPC, but none have come to OSG so far.

%BLUE%Zach Miller%ENDCOLOR% has received the final assignments from all 4 students but he has not reviewed them.  He will read those and get back to the students.

---+++ Student Reports
%BLUE%Igor Senderovich%ENDCOLOR% has started running jobs using glideinWMS.  He is working some issues in their code that need to be addressed before submitting out onto the grid.  Other issues, like carrying along dependencies and so forth, have been addressed already.  This sounds like real progress.

%BLUE%Yasi Khorramzadeh%ENDCOLOR% is using SGE at Virginia Tech since it does not have condor.  She used the DAGMAN idea in writing shell scripts to control her jobs.  

%BLUE%Javier Tabima%ENDCOLOR% is just installing grid software at Universidad de los Andes.  He wants to use it in the biology clusters (2 clusters one with 12 machines with 24 cores each another with 8 machines with 5 cores each).  The second cluster will be a condor cluster.  They are also trying to integrate with the Colombian grid, so he could get access to more machines that way.  Tim will follow up and learn more.

%BLUE%Ray Sehgal%ENDCOLOR% is just about to go onto the Grid since he has exhausted his local resources for his Chemical Engineering work and now needs to broaden the parameter sweep.  Ray plans to use OSG via the Engage VO.

%BLUE%Julio Goez%ENDCOLOR% is experimenting with problem using condor and DAGMAN.  He is trying to get real (vs test) data from industry now that he has it working.  Has a 200 core cluster with 16 cores/machine with 32 GB memory.  Julio has been trying to get people to use condor at Lehigh.  He reports that his mentor, Igor, has been a great help via email exchanges.

%BLUE%Terrence Neumann%ENDCOLOR% was unable to be at the meeting because he was meeting with collaborators discussing a recent grant award that may fund his work as a postdoc.  He send the following report:%BR%
After leaving the OSG workshop this summer, I helped my research advisor move institutions and have been getting our experimental lab up and running.  So the application of the items I learned in Madison has been limited.  We are currently building a Condor cluster and I am planning on joining the eNMR VO as my advisor's focus is nuclear magnetic resonance.  As I finish my doctoral degree, I'll be working through the proposal I prepared for as the OSG Summer School final project.  I intend to test these ideas on our Condor cluster and then submit jobs to OSG clusters. 
As I move into a postdoc (I'll likely be staying with my Ph.D. advisor), I am interested in further refining my HTC skills.  I'm hoping to attend Condor week with some of my new colleagues at Concordia University Wisconsin.
