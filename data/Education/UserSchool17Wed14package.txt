---+ Wednesday Exercise 1.4: Pre-packaging Code

In this exercise, you will create an installation of a molecular dynamics simulation package (GROMACS) and then create \
a wrapper script to unpack that installation to run jobs.  It should take 40-45 minutes.  

---++ Background 

Some software cannot be compiled into a single executable, whether you compile it yourself (as in [[UserSchool17Wed11compiling][Exercise 1.1]]) or 
download it already compiled (as in [[UserSchool17Wed12precompiled][Exercise 1.2]]).  
In this case, it is necessary to download or create a portable copy of the software and then use a 
wrapper script (as in the [[UserSchool17Wed13wrapper][previous exercise]]) to "install" the software on a per job basis.  This script can either 
install the software from the source code, or (as in this exercise), unpack a portable software 
package that you've pre-built yourself.  

---++ Our Software Example

For this exercise, we will be using the molecular dynamic simulation software package GROMACS.  GROMACS is a good example of 
software that is not compiled to a single executable: a researcher may want to run multiple GROMACS commands in order to 
complete a full simulation.  

   1. Do an internet search to find the GROMACS software downloads page.  
   1. Create a directory for this exercise on the CHTC submit server =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= (*not* =osg-learn.chtc.wisc.edu=), and download GROMACS version 5.1.2 into that directory.  

---++ Where to Prepare

Our goal is to pre-build a GROMACS installation, and then write a script that will unpack that installation and run a simulation.  

   1. Where can we create this pre-built installation?  Based on the end of the lecture, what are our options and which would be most appropriate?  Make a guess before moving on.  
   1. Because we're on the CHTC-based submit node (=learn.chtc.wisc.edu=), we have the option of using an interactive job to build the GROMACS installation.  This is a good option because the submit server is already busy with lots of users and the GROMACS install will be longer than a minute or two.  To submit an interactive job do the following: 
      1. Copy the following lines into a file named =build.submit= \
<pre class="file">
universe = vanilla

output = build.out
error = build.err
log = build.log

should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
transfer_input_files = 

request_disk = 2GB
request_memory = 2GB

# Make sure to get a session on CHTC's compiling servers:
+IsBuildJob = true
requirements = (OpSysMajorVer == 6) && ( IsBuildSlot == true )

queue
</pre>
      1. Note the lack of executable.  Condor doesn't need an executable for this job because it will be interactive, meaning _you_ are running the commands instead of Condor.  
      1. In order to create the installation, we will need the source code to come with us.  The =transfer_input_files= line is blank - fill it in with the name of our GROMACS source tarball.  
      1. To request an interactive job, we will add a =-i= flag to the =condor_submit= command.  The whole command you enter should look like this: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_submit -i build.submit</strong> 
</pre>

---++ Read Through Installation Documentation

While you're waiting for the interactive job to start, you can start reading the GROMACS installation documentation online. 

   1. Find the installation documentation for GROMACS, by clicking through the link to installation instructions on the [[http://www.gromacs.org/Downloads][downloads page]].  We're using GROMACS 5.1.2 and we want to find the "Installation Guide."  
   1. [[http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1.2/install-guide/index.html][There's a lot of information about installation]]!  Which section of the documentation will likely have a quick overview of the installation process?  Guess which section, then move to the next item.  
   1. A short installation overview will be likely be available in the section on [[http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1.2/install-guide/index.html#quick-and-dirty-installation]["Quick and Dirty Installation"]].  \
Sure enough, that section provides the following information: \
<pre class="file">
1. Get the latest version of your C and C++ compilers.
2. Check that you have CMake version 2.8.8 or later.
3. Get and unpack the latest version of the GROMACS tarball.
4. Make a separate build directory and change to it.
5. Run cmake with the path to the source as an argument
6. Run make, make check, and make install
7. Source GMXRC to get access to GROMACS

Or, as a sequence of commands to execute:

$ tar xfz gromacs-5.1.2.tar.gz
$ cd gromacs-5.1.2
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
$ source /usr/local/gromacs/bin/GMXRC
</pre>\
\
This is helpful because it gives a sense of \
what steps are necessary to install GROMACS.  
   1. What is the problem with the final line of installation instructions? \
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>
   1. =sudo= indicates the need for administrative privileges, which are not available \
to you within a job.  You usually need administrative privileges if the software is being installed \
in a system location like =/usr/bin= or =/usr/local=.  This means that we will have to change \
at least one step in the install procedure to make sure that we're \
installing to the job's working directory (where we have the ability to install software) instead of a \
protected system location (where we don't have the ability to install software).  \
Often, software's installation location can be set by using a "prefix" argument, typically during a configuration step \
of the installation.  Try to find which section of the documentation talks about this and what the option is.  
   1. This information appears in multiple places in the GROMACS installation guide: 
      * At the beginning of the guide, the [[http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1.2/install-guide/index.html#typical-installation][Typical Installation]] \
section has a line indicating an option, =-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= that will allow you to set the installation location. 
      * Later, in [[http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1.2/install-guide/index.html#installing-gromacs][Installing Gromacs]], it says the =make install= step will install the software to a location provided to the =cmake= installation step, and can be modified with the =-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= option.  
   1. So we will have to set the installation prefix to our job's working directory, using the <pre>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location</pre> \
argument to =cmake=.  

---++ Installation

Your interactive job should have started by now and we've learned about installing our program.  Let's test it out.  Note that some of these steps may take a long time to complete.  

   1. Run the commands to unpack the source code and make directories: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>tar xfz gromacs-5.1.2.tar.gz</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd gromacs-5.1.2</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>mkdir build</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd build</strong>
</pre>\

   1. The next step is using =cmake= with the =-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= install option.  The job working directory is created uniquely for each job, so we won't be able to "hard-code" a specific path name into the argument like =/home/username= or =scratch/username=.  Luckily, we can use a special unix variable, =$(pwd)= to indicate the working directory.  =$(pwd)= gives an absolute path to the current working directory, and from there, you can add on a relative path to the location of your choice.  First, let's check our current location: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>echo $(pwd)</strong> 
/var/lib/condor/execute/slot1/dir_30435/gromacs-4.6.5/build
</pre> \
If we want to install to the working directory (=/var/lib/condor/execute/slot1/dir_30435=), we will want to set the installation prefix as =$(pwd)/../..=.  So our =cmake= command will be this: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)/../../</strong>
</pre>\
Run this command to move to the next step.  \

   1. Finish the installation:  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>make</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>make check</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>make install</strong>
</pre>\
Note that these steps can take a long time!  Feel free to open a new tab/terminal window and make a second connection to =learn.chtc.wisc.edu= to start working on the \
wrapper script and submit file steps below.  
   1. *Go back to the job's main working directory*: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>cd ../..</strong>
</pre>\
and confirm that our installation procedure created a =bin=, \
=lib64=, =share=, and =include= directories.  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>ls</strong>
bin gromacs-5.1.2 gromacs-5.1.2.tar.gz lib64 include share
</pre>
   1. Now we want to package up our installation, so we can use it in other jobs.  We can do this simply by compressing any necessary directories \
into a single gzipped tarball.  First, create a directory for the total installation.  Then move the installation directories inside, and tar it up!  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>mkdir gromacs</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>mv bin lib64 share include gromacs</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>tar czf gromacs.tar.gz gromacs/</strong>
</pre>\

   1. Once everything is complete, type =exit= to leave the interactive job.  Make sure that your tarball is in the main working directory - it will be transferred back to the submit server automatically.  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>exit</strong>
</pre>

---++ Wrapper Script

Now that we've created our portable installation, we need to write a script that opens and uses the installation.  These steps should be performed back on the submit server.  

   1. The first step for our script is to untar our installation.  Create a script called =run_gromacs.sh= and include the following lines: \
      <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

tar xzf gromacs.tar.gz
</pre>\

   1. The installation description used a certain set of instructions to access GROMACS, but we're going to use a more common method - that of \
adding our gromacs installation to the =PATH= environment variable.  \
<pre class="file">
export PATH=$(pwd)/gromacs/bin:$PATH
</pre>\
Note that because the job's execute directory will be different each time, we're again using the =$(pwd)= command to describe the local working directory. \

   1. Finally, the wrapper script needs to not only install GROMACS, but actually run the GROMACS commands.  Add the following lines to your =run_gromacs.sh= wrapper script.  \
<pre class="file">
gmx pdb2gmx -f 3HTB_clean.pdb -o 3HTB_processed.gro -water spc -ff gromos43a1
gmx grompp -v -f minim.mdp -c 3HTB_processed.gro -p topol.top -o results.tpr
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm results -c 3HTB_processed.gro 
</pre>\

   1. Make sure the wrapper script has executable permissions: \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>chmod +x run_gromacs.sh</strong>
</pre>

---++ Run a GROMACS job

We're almost ready!  We need two more pieces to run a GROMACS job.  

   1. Download the necessary input files to your directory on the submit server and then untar them.  \
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>wget http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/osgschool16/gromacs_files.tar.gz</strong>
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>tar -xzf gromacs_files.tar.gz</strong>
</pre>
   1. Our last step is to create a submit file for our GROMACS job.  Think about which lines this submit file will need.  Make a copy of a previous submit file (you could use the =build.submit= file from the interactive job as a base) and modify it as you think necessary.  
   1. The two most important lines to modify for this job are listed below; check them against your own submit file: \
<pre class="file">
executable = run_gromacs.sh
transfer_input_files = gromacs.tar.gz,3HTB_clean.pdb,JZ4.pdb,minim.mdp
</pre> \
A wrapper script will always be a job's =executable=.  When using a wrapper script, you must also always remember to transfer the software/source code using =transfer_input_files=.  
   1. We also need to add a requirement to ensure that the job will run on a Linux system, running major version 6.  This can be done with the line: \
<pre class="file">
requirements = (OpSys == "LINUX") && (OpSysMajorVer == 6) && has_avx
</pre>
   1. Submit the job with =condor_submit=.
   1. Once the job completes, it should produce a =results.log= file, along with various other intermediate files.  

---++ Food for thought

If you have completed all three exercises before the break, think about the following questions and try out an implementation of your answers.  

   1. When we installed GROMACS to the working directory of our interactive job, the various GROMACS \
   directories (=bin=, =lib64=, =include= and so on) just appeared \
   in the working directory of the job.  What commands would you add or change in our installation process in order to: 
      1. create a directory called =gromacs= inside the job's working directory?
      1. install GROMACS to this location?
   1. When we submitted our GROMACS job, there were a lot of intermediate files (=.gro=, =.top=) that came back with our desired results.  What commands \
could you add to the wrapper script to delete these files before the job exits?  
   1. How would you change your submit file to transfer the tarball of input files instead of transferring them individually?  How would you have to change your \
=run_gromacs.sh= script accordingly?
