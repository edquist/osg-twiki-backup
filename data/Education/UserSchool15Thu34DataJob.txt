----+  Data share and Collaborate

In the previous example (Exercise 2.3), a remote collaborator shared the data for you. The basic idea is sharing the data to establish the collaborative work. Now pair up with your next person and try the data sharing by yourself. On OSG connect (login.osgconnect.net), create the a data sharing directory and put the NAMD input files. Tell your friend the location of data. Get the location of your friend's uploaded data. Run NAMD simulation with your friend's uploaded data. 

<pre>
1. Create a directory "data-share"  under the directory ~/public
2. Copy  NAMD input files to ~/public/data-share
3. See the files show up at http://stash.osgconnect.net/+username/data-share (username is your login ID on OSG Connect)
4. Tell your friend about the location of NAMD input files
5. Get the location of your friends data-share directory
6. Write condor job description with the location provided by your friend and write a job wrapper script
7. Submit the job and check the outputs after job completion
