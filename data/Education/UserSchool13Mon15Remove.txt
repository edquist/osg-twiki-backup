---+ Monday Exercise 1.5: Remove Jobs From the Queue

The goal of this exercise is to remove jobs from the queue. This is helpful if you make a mistake, do not want to wait for a job to complete, or otherwise need to fix things.

This exercise is very short, but if you are out of time, come back to it later.


---++ Removing a Job From the Queue

To practice removing jobs from the queue, you need a job in the queue!

   1. Submit a job from an earlier exercise
   1. Determine the job ID (=cluster.process=) from the =condor_submit= output or from =condor_q=
   1. Remove the job:\
       <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_rm <em>job_id</em></strong></pre>\
       <p>Use the full job ID this time, e.g., =5759.0=.</p>
   1. Did the job leave the queue immediately? If not, about how long did it take?

So far, we have created job clusters that contain only one job process (the =.0= part of the job ID). That will change soon, so it is good to know how to remove a specific job ID. However, it is possible to remove all jobs that are part of a cluster at once. Simply omit the job process (the =.0= part of the job ID) in the =condor_rm= command:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_rm <em>cluster</em></strong>
</pre>

Finally, you can include many job clusters and full job IDs in a single =condor_rm= command. For example:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_rm 5768 5769 5770.0 5771.2</strong>
</pre>


---++ Removing All of Your Jobs

If you really want to remove all of your jobs at once, you can do that.

   1. Quickly submit several jobs from past exercises
   1. View the jobs in the queue with =condor_q=
   1. Remove them all at once\
       <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% <strong>condor_rm <em>userid</em></strong></pre>\
       <p>Use your login user ID for =userid=.</p>
   1. Use =condor_q= to track progress

In case you are wondering, you can remove only your own jobs. HTCondor administrators can remove anyone’s jobs, so be nice to them.
