---+ 2013 OSG User School - Using directly the Grid

Time to spend on this: 45 minutes 

We will use [[OSGSS2013TueGlideinSetup][the DHTC submit node]] for this exercise, too.

---+++ Motivation

You may wonder why this exercise is needed at all.
After all, Igor told you that DHTC is normally used through an overlay system.

However, there may be times when you get access to a Grid site that your overlay infrastructure does (yet) not support.
In those cases, it might be convenient to start using the Grid resources through direct submission.
It is likely be a little work to get it to work, but the payout may just be big enough to be worth the pain.

---+++ Simulating a Dynamical billiard

In this exercise session, we will try to find the best way to shot a billiard ball in a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_billiards][Dynamical Billiard]].
This problem is particularly interesting since it is by definition a chaotic system;
i.e. a very small change in the ball's initial condition will result in a completely different result.

We will be working with a billiard table that has 16 round obstacles on it. The system is idealized, with the ball being point-like.
We will start from a fixed starting point and will try to find the best angle that results in the ball ending in the upper right corner.

We will approach the problem as a parameter sweep; i.e. we will try out all the possible angles and see how the ball behaves. 
In order to finish in a reasonable amount of time, we will discretize the sweep in 10^-4 of a degree.
