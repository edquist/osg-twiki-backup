---+ Site Benefits and Requirements for !perfSONAR Monitoring


---++ Introduction

OSG sites rely upon the network to provide access to their computing and storage.  The network provides the basis for OSG users to access those resources and for virtual organizations to organize the sharing and use of their member's resources.   When there are problems in the network, it can significantly degrade or even disable users and VOs ability to do their science.   

Networking problems can be difficult to identify and isolate for numerous reasons:
   * Network paths typically span multiple administrative domains with no single entity having complete access to the end-to-end infrastructure components
   * Applications that work well on a Local Area Network (LAN) may behave significantly differently when run on a Wide Area Network (WAN) due to the impact of latency on the network communication involved
   * End-host or LAN issues may be the actual source of problems and differentiating HOST vs LAN vs WAN problems can be difficult without sufficient expertise
   * Problems that actually exist on a host or in the LAN may not be "visible" in local use and only show up when the application is used in the WAN.  The tendency is to believe the WAN is the problem even though it many cases it isn't
   * Real WAN problems are hard to localize and it is not practical or effective to contact every entity managing a portion of the network path on which you see a problem

OSG's goal is to help users, VOs and site administrators better understand their network infrastructure and enable them to more effectively find problems and isolate their root cause.  To do this we are recommending that all OSG sites deploy perfSONAR-PS Toolkit instances in their infrastructure.

---++ Benefits 

By deploying perfSONAR-PS Toolkit instances sites and users will benefit in a number of ways:

   * Once installed the PS toolkit instances can serve as an on-demand test point, allowing both local and remote users to test the network connection between them and the site
   * The site can participate in automated, regularly scheduled tests of their network which provide
      * A baseline for their network behaviour to/from other OSG sites
      * Data on the historical and current network performance to other sites of interest
      * The ability to determine when problems began or when some change impacted the network
      * A set of metrics which are used by network engineers to find and isolate network problems.
      * The ability to identify network bottlenecks where upgrades may be helpful
   * Their site will be instrumented in a standard way so that if network problems are suspected, remote experts can easily make a first-pass diagnosis without the site needing to do anything

Our focus has been in providing a toolkit that is robust and will hopefully operate with minimal effort from the site.   Our goal is to achieve "set-it-and-forget" capability that provides a network test-point for each OSG site.

---++ Requirements

To participate, each OSG site should plan on providing two inexpensive computers that should be co-located with the sites primary storage (or computing if there is no grid storage at the site)

   * Hardware:  
   * Network Connection
   * Registration
