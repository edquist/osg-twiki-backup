---++ Respond to requests from the OSG Security Officer
In many ways, the most important security requirement for running a site is that you communicate with the OSG Security Officer and the [[Security.SecurityTeamMembers][Security Team]].  When issues come up or incidents occur there is usually some manual intervention required and this means reading email from the OSG security team or taking phone calls (in the most urgent cases).  In order to be sure that OSG can communicate with the site administrator responsible for security of a site there is the periodic update of contact information in OIM (as described above).

If you have confidential information to provide to the OSG security team, it can be sent via encrypted email (see description below) or submitted as a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/security][security ticket to the GOC]] (requires a registered X509 certificate in your browser). Of course, you can always use the telephone as well for secure communications (call the [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/][GOC]] or [[Security.SecurityTeamMembers][individual security team members]]). 

%BLUE%Anything you tell OSG security team in confidentiality will be kept confidential. We will not share it with any other parties, including other sites, VOs, and OSG management. Of course, if the preservation of the information presents an imminent threat against the security of OSG, we may need to share it with other parties.  BUT, before doing that we will inform you first, and decide how much to disclose and how to disclose the information.%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Incident Response Drills
OSG occasionally conducts security drills (think fire drill) with some or all of the OSG sites.  Since we (thankfully, knock wood) don't have many actual incidents, it is important that the communications and response patterns needed for a real incident are exercised to make sure they actually function. There was a rather detailed drill conducted with the Tier1 centers (BNL, FNAL) and there was also a drill for Tier2 centers.  We are not currently (January 2010) planning on a drill for the Tier3 centers (beyond the OIM contact information update), but it is likely some type of drill will be planned in the future.  When such a drill occurs, we inform you about it several days before and the emails are very clearly marked as indicating a drill rather than a real incident. So there will be a lot of communication before such a drill is conducted with Tier3s.

The drills are not to embarrass sites, or grade them, but to teach ourselves what needs to be done in a real security emergency. So do not treat drills as quizzes, but as learning opportunities.
