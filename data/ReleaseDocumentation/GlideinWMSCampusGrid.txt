---+!! *GlideinWMS in a Campus Grid*
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++ Introduction
This document will describe how to configure a !GlideinWMS frontend to run in a Campus Grid.  The !GlideinWMS Fronted install document can be found [[ReleaseDocumentation.GlideinWMSVOFrontendInstall][here]].


---++ Required Software
   1. [[GlideinWMSFrontendInstall][GlideinWMS Frontend]]


---++ !GlideinWMS Frontend - Security Configuration
The configuration of the !GlideinWMS Frontend must allow other hosts to communicate with the frontend.  By default, the GlideinWMS Frontend has very strong security, requiring GSI certs to communicate.

---+++ Enabling alternative authentication methods
It is necessary to enable authentication methods that are acceptable to the campus.  CLAIMTOBE is recommended in the [[CampusFactoryInstall][Campus Factory Install]] guide, and will be used to implement host (ip address) based security in this document.  

First enable the CLAIMTOBE method.  Copy and paste the below into a condor configuration file.
<pre class="file">
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = $(SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS), CLAIMTOBE
</pre>

---+++ Modify the =condor_mapfile=
The =condor_mapfile= is used by Condor to map a authenticated user to a human readable identity to be used in authentication rules.  It is important to note that the =condor_mapfile= uses regular expressions to map from authentication methods to users.  This is why there are many escapes (=\=) in the below example.

<pre class="file">
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=Services\/CN\=host\/hcc\-grid\.unl\.edu$" dweitzel
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=Services\/CN\=host\/cpass\.unl\.edu$" dweitzel
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=People\/CN\=Ajit\ Kumar\ Mohapatra\ 867118$" cmsprod
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=Services\/CN\=host\/(.*)\.unl\.edu$" \1@daemon.unl.edu
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=doegrids\/OU\=Services\/CN\=host\/(.*)\.rcac\.purdue\.edu$" \1@daemon.purdue.edu
GSI (.*) anonymous
CLAIMTOBE .* anonymous@claimtobe
CLAIMTOBE ".*@ff-grid.unl.edu" dweitzel
FS (.*) \1
</pre>

Lets break down the =condor_mapfile= further.  

---+++ Authorizing hosts

<pre class="file">
DENY_WRITE = anonymous@* 
ALLOW_WRITE = *@unl.edu *@glidein.unl.edu execute-side@matchsession *@daemon.unl.edu *@daemon.purdue.edu
#*@claimtobe/*.purdue.edu 
DENY_ADVERTISE_SCHEDD = anonymous@*
DENY_ADMINISTRATOR = anonymous@*
DENY_DAEMON = anonymous@glidein.unl.edu 
ALLOW_DAEMON = *@unl.edu *@glidein.unl.edu  execute-side@matchsession *@daemon.unl.edu *@daemon.purdue.edu
# *@claimtobe/*.purdue.edu
DENY_NEGOTIATOR = anonymous@glidein.unl.edu 
ALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = */*.unl.edu *@daemon.purdue.edu
#, */*.purdue.edu
</pre>

---++ First Time Install
A link to document containing information and install steps that only need to be performed if this a first time install.

---++ Installation Procedure
The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using 
<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Description of the steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
This often requires, the reader to edit lines in a config file.
If this is necessary, put the lines in a screen box with a yellow background 
(to distinguish from entering commands (green box).
<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation
Commands to be used to verify the service is working correctly.  This can be combined with the previous section if they are both short.

#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Information
---+++!!File Locations
Locations of configuration files, input/output files, log files, etc. that are important for an administrator to know about if something doesn't work.  

---+++!!Debugging Procedure
What are the first things to check, step-by-step instructions to determine source of problem for this service

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues 

---+++!!References
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants more background or information.
