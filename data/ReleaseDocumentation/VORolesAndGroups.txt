---+ Roles and Groups in a VO
%TOC%
---++Introduction
The text in this page is adapted from the [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/vomrs1_3/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm][VO Membership Registration Service manual version 1_3]], where VOMRS is a server that provides the means for registering members of a VO, and coordination of this process among the various VO and grid resource administrators.  Groups and roles are thus described in a way that allows for easy (though optional) integration with VOMRS. 
---++ About Groups 
A group is an organizational entity defined by the VO which refers to a subdivision of the VO's overall project, and to which some subset of the VO's members are assigned, according to their responsibilities in the project. Each group has one or more group owners, group managers, and members, all of whom are VO members. <!--Each group has the description that defines the purpose of the group. Each group is assigned the access type. The "Open" access means that a member does not need administrator's approval in order to be assign to this group. A "Restricted" access means a member may only submit the request to be assigned to this group and will need administrator's approval. Each group may have set of group role associated with it. -->

A VO may want to organize groups hierarchically starting with a single VO-wide root group, owned by a VO administrator, to which all members get assigned. The VO administrator would be responsible for assigning ownership to next-level-down parent groups for each group hierarchy. A member assigned to a given group (somewhere down in the hierarchy) would be granted membership in all parent groups. <!--A VO member can request her/his own groups and group roles assignment. A VO or Group administrator can assign/approve/deny access to the groups and group roles at any time. Once a member is denied assignment to a particular group or group role she/he can re-apply for assignment to this given group or group role. -->

A given local resource provider (LRP) may enforce different resource access privileges for different groups within the VO. This is done via a mapping between the VO groups and local resource privileges. This mapping is expected to implement default behavior for any VO/group/subgroup not known to the LRP. For example, say a user is a member of groups MYVO:generic and MYVO:x. If the group MYVO:x is not recognized by this particular LRP, the mapping should ensure that the user get the access privileges for the group MYVO:generic. 

---++ About Roles 
LRPs need to be able to differentiate between classes of users in order to appropriately map users to accounts on their local resources. Some users will inevitably require greater privileges than others. This differentiation is accomplished via roles that correspond to particular computing privileges at a site and to which VO members may be assigned.  Roles definition occurs at the VO. A role would be defined VO-wide and associated with particular groups.  
---++ About Group Roles 
LRPs need to be able to differentiate between classes of users in order to appropriately map users to accounts on their local resources. Some users will inevitably require greater privileges than others. This differentiation is accomplished via a mechanism called "group roles", which are roles that correspond to particular computing privileges at a site and to which VO members may be assigned. 

Group roles would be defined VO-wide and associated with particular groups.  Each group/group-role pair would be assigned an access type. If group access is "Restricted" then the access to any group role that is associated with this group will be restricted.<!-- and a member can only request assignment to this group, group role. If group has access "Open" then the access to the group role associated with this group can be either "Open" or "Restricted". In case of "Open" access a member can assign himself/herself to the group. Group roles get assigned to members via the same VOMRS screen as groups, and a member must be assigned to at least one group in order to be assigned a group role. Members may be assigned to multiple group roles. -->
