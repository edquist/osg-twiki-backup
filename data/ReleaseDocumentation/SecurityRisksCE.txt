---+!! Cyber Security Risks of Grid Resources

*In Preparation*

%TOC%

---++ What is a Risk?
A risk is a combination of a threat and a vulnerability.
A threat is someone (or something) making an attempt to do some harm to a site (computer resource).
It can be malicious, accidental or just "some kids out for fun".
A vulnerability is a weakness in the system that can be exploited by someone to cause
harm to the system.  Examples are kernel vulnerabilities that can be exploited to
cause privilege escalation whereby a normal user can become superuser,
or a service that can handle only a limited number of connection attempts so it
can suffer from denial of service attacks.

Risks can be graded by the probability of occurrence and the amount of damage that
can be caused by exploiting the vulnerability.  
A vulnerability can exist but if there is no threat community trying to exploit it then
the risk is low (at least for now).
If a threat community is very active in trying to exploit a vulnerability (such as ssh)
but the system is not vulnerable (ssh is restricted to the local subnet and the system has no normal
user accounts) then the risk is low.
If a system is left unpatched (like a new install of an OS), exposed to the public internet and runs many services, like
ssh, http, nfs, smb, ... then the risk is very high.  There are stories of plugging an unpatched Windows system into
a campus network and it will be infected by the time it finishes booting up.

As a system administrator, there are risks for the systems you maintain. If and when your systems get infected
then they become a source of risk for other computers on the network and the grid.
When one of your systems gets hacked then credentials on your system can be used to
access other systems on the network where those credentials are authorized.

The normal best practice to minimize risk is to run only the necessary services, limit network access with a host-based firewall 
(such as iptables) and to keep up with the OS and middleware patches.

---++ How does risk of Grid resource compare to risk of other internet services?

---++ Globus Gatekeeper
---+++ Credential theft
Grid proxy credentials are stored on a gatekeeper so it is a potential target of credential theft.

---+++ !DoS
The gatekeeper is susceptible to denial of service by having too many jobs submitted to it.
Running the gridmanager helps alleviate this vulnerability but it is run by the client, and is one of the main reasons that
OSG encourages the use of condor-g for job submission.

---+++ Data Integrity



---++ !GridFTP server (gsiftp)

---++ SRM (!BeStMan), (!dCache)

---++ RSV

---++ GUMS

---++ Trusted CAs
