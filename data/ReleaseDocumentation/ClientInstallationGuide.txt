---++ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users and system administrators. It covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools Package. This package is required on every host used by grid users to submit jobs or transfer data on the OSG. It is also mandatory to be installed by grid resource administrators on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% and every %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN%.  

The OSG Cient Tools Package includes:

   * the %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% providing client tools for authorization, data transfer and job submission.
   * a list of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCertificate][Certificates]] trusted by the OSG.
   * the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCRL][Certificate Revocation List]] and tools to keep it current.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% client tools for job submission and workflow management.
   * client tools to access a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM% provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%.

%NOTE%This document does not cover the usage of the client tools, which can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]].

---++!! Engineering Considerations.

The OSG Client Tools Package is required on following resources:

   1 a job submission host used to submit jobs to the Open Science Grid
   1 a %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER% part of a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%
   1 every %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN% associated with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER%

We recommend to install the OSG Client Tools on a _dedicated_ job submission host (1.) for large scale job submissions to production resources on the OSG. Grid users may install the package as _non-root_ users into their home directories. If the client tools are to be shared among users on the job submission host, the installation should be performed by the _root_ user. We strongly recommend to use a [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Public_IP_Address_and_DNS][public IP address and a fully qualified domain name]] for the job submission host.

System administrators installing the OSG Client Tools on a set of [[Documentation/GlossaryW#DefsWorkerNode][worker nodes]] (3.) of mixed architecture should consider [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Sharing_the_Installation_between][forcing]] the installation of the %RED%i686%ENDCOLOR% version if one installation is to be _shared_ among all worker nodes. Otherwise each worker node requires an individual installation.

<!-- this should go into the instructions below
The install directory must be accessible for all users: if root installs into a directory that is not world-readable, the install process will fail.
If you are interested, then check the [[#Install_32bit_on_64bit_OS_Full_3][section below on forcing 32 bit software]] before starting the installation.
   1 *WARNING* If you already have an OSG-Client installed, its presence in the installation directory or in the environment might corrupt this installation attempt.  Verify that you are installing into an empty directory and the $VDT_LOCATION environment variable isn't already set; you may have to log in to a fresh shell or remove something from your shell's profile. 
      * If $VDT_LOCATION is already set, you may receive indecipherable errors while attempting this install.  Or you may get no errors at all, but end up with an unusable software stack.
      * It is OK to have other installation of OSG-Client on your disks but should be in different directories and the setup file should not have been sourced.
  
      * If you do a non-root install, make sure that you own your =$HOME/.globus= directory and its permissions are 755.

---++!! Getting Help!

To get assistance please use [[InstallHelpProcedure][this page]].

---++ Requirements

   1 verify that your operating system is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]].
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION%.
   1 except for worker node installations a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required.
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required.
   1 unset the environment variable *VDT_LOCATION* in case it has previously been set.

---++ Installation Procedure

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 create an empty installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the OSG Client Tools Package
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 configure logfile rotation and automatic updates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 Enable %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% to support Condor-G Job Submissions

---+++ Create the Installation Directory

<!-- define Twiki variable for use on this document
   * Local INSTALL_DIR = /opt/osg-ctp
   * Local INSTALL_LOGIN = user
   * Local INSTALL_HOST = client
-->

Create an empty installation directory and change into it. Make sure the directory is world readable if the installation is to be shared by grid users: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se ~]# mkdir -p %INSTALL_DIR%
[root@osg-se ~]# cd %INSTALL_DIR%
</pre>

Make sure to %RED%unset%ENDCOLOR% the *VDT_LOCATION* environment variable in case it is set.

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# echo $VDT_LOCATION 
/usr/local/ITB-BeStMan
root@osg-se osg-ctp]# unset VDT_LOCATION
</pre>

---+++ Use Pacman to install the OSG Client Tools Package

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to _trust the cache_ and _accept the license_, answer =yall= and =y= if you want to do so.

<pre class="screen">

%ENDTWISTY%

---+++ Install the CA Certificates and the CRL

The OSG distributes a number of root certificates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authorities]] that issue certificates to their members. By installing these certificates you establish a chain of trust with each of the certificate authorities and allow their members to access your resource. The %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% is used to inform your resource about individual certificates that have been revoked.

We will use the =vdt-ca-manage= command to download the CA Certificates and the Certificate Revocation List. The command line option =--location local= copies the CA certificates into the subdirectory =%INSTALL_DIR%/globus/share/certificates=. 

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-ca-manage setupca --url %RED%osg%ENDCOLOR% --location %RED%local%ENDCOLOR%
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '/opt/osg-ctp'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

%NOTE% The default location for the CA Certificates and the CRL is below =/etc/grid-security=. Use =--location root= 

---+++ Configure Logfile Rotation and Automatic Updates

To keep your [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% current we will add an entry to =cron= requesting periodic updates. We also recommend to setup logfile rotation using =vdt-control= at the command line:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-control --enable %RED%fetch-crl vdt-update-certs vdt-rotate-logs%ENDCOLOR% 
running 'vdt-register-service --name fetch-crl --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-update-certs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-rotate-logs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

=vdt-control= will only _register the services_ requested to be run by =cron=. 

---+++ Enable Condor to support Condor-G Job Submissions

Large scale production job submissions require a capable scheduler submitting jobs to grid resources and monitoring their status. Enabling support for %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% on the submission host is all that is required to create a local grid queue on your submission host: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-control -enable condor
running 'vdt-register-service --name condor --enable'... ok
</pre>

---+++ Advanced Configuration Options

Completing the steps outlined above will install a fully functional OSG Client. The following section discusses optional and advanced configuration options.   

---++++ CA Certificates and CRL

The program =vdt-ca-manage= provides convenient options to configure which [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authority]] to trust and how to install the CA Certificates on your resource.

---+++++ System-wide Installation

The default location for CA Certificates is =/etc/grid-security/certificates= and should preferably be used to make the certificates system-wide available:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-ca-manage setupca %RED%--location root%ENDCOLOR% --url osg
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '/opt/osg-ctp'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

---+++++ Use an existing CA Installation

It is often practical to reuse an existing %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% Installation instead of creating a new installation using =vdt-ca-manage=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# source setup.sh
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-ca-manage setupca %RED%--location /etc/grid-security/certificates%ENDCOLOR% --no-update
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '/opt/osg-ctp'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

%ICON{hand}% The command line option =--location= points to the existing installation. The command creates a softlink from =%INSTALL_DIR%/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to =/etc/grid-security/certificates=.

---+++++ Provide and Install a custom CA Package

If a custom %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% certificates package was made available on a web server, it can be used to be installed instead of the OSG specific CA package using the =--url= option on the command line to =vdt-ca-manage=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# source setup.sh
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-ca-manage setupca --location /full/path/to/CAinstallation --url http://your.web.server/path/to/CA_distribution
</pre>

By default this enables the periodic update of the CA Certificates and the CRL.

---++++  Firewall Considerations

The %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% require the client host to _allow_ inbound and outbound network connections. This section describes what additional configuration steps have to be taken if the client host is located behind a firewall. For a more detailed description on firewalls consult [[ComputeElementFirewalls][this]] document.

---+++++ Public IP Address and DNS

The client host needs to use a _public_ IP address and not be be located within a private network in order to be connected by remote resources. Please make sure that the client host uses a public IP address and is assigned a fully qualified domain name:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# hostname -f
%RED%osg-se.ligo.caltech.edu%ENDCOLOR%
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# nslookup osg-se.ligo.caltech.edu
Server:		131.215.125.1
Address:	131.215.125.1#53

Name:           %RED%osg-se.ligo.caltech.edu%ENDCOLOR%
Address:        %RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

If the client host is not assigned a fully qualified domain name, you can assign the _public IP address_ to the =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# echo "GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=%RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%" >> %INSTALL_DIR%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# source setup.sh
</pre> 

%NOTE% It is possible to use a client host that is located inside a private network using Network Address Translation. In this case the gatekeeper must be configured to forward incoming connections to the client host. The =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable must be set to the gatekeeper address. This procedure is currently not documented.

---+++++ Globus Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% can be configured to only use a specified range of TCP ports on the client host for inbound (=GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=) and outbound (=GLOBUS_TCP_PORTRANGE=) connections.

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# echo "export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%20000,22499%ENDCOLOR%" >> %INSTALL_DIR%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# echo "export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%22500,25000%ENDCOLOR%" >> %INSTALL_DIR%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++++ Condor Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% will only use a specified range of TCP ports for inbound and outbound connections on the client host that is configured in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# echo $CONDOR_CONFIG 
%INSTALL_DIR%/condor/etc/condor_config
</pre>

Please un-comment and adjust the definitions for =LOWPORT= and =HIGHPORT= in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%LOWPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#LOWPORT = 9600
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%HIGHPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#HIGHPORT = 9700 
</pre>

Restart Condor in order for the settings to take effect:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# /etc/init.d/condor stop
Shutting down Condor
Sent "Kill-Daemon" command for "master" to local master
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# /etc/init.d/condor start
Starting up Condor
</pre>

<!-- Marco

Some Grid job initiation and management operations require call backs to the client machine, accordingly *any* firewall on the host (or an external firewall affecting the host) can possibly break an installation.  *If you have a firewall, read this section*; otherwise, ignore it.

   * If your client host is behind a firewall and not registered in DNS, assign your client's ip-address to the =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= variable: 
      * <pre class="screen">  export GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=<i>your-ip-address</i> </pre>
   * If your client is behind a firewall blocking ephemeral ports, an ephemeral port range should be set aside for use and opened for incoming connections.  Opening the port range may depend on your firewall implementation. If you are doing a personal non-root installation, check with your administrator to determine which ports are open for you to use.  Then, identifying the port range in the client tools is done in two places (numbers shown here are just examples):
      * Specify the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE  variables (to set the inbound and outbound available port ranges, see ComputeElementFirewalls for more information) in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh (and vdt-local-setup.csh) script: <pre class="screen">
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=20000,22000
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=23000,25000 
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
</pre>
      * Specify range in for use by Condor-g in the $CONDOR_CONFIG file ( *Note:* condor must be restarted):  <pre class="screen">
HIGHPORT = 22000 
LOWPORT  = 20000
</pre>

---++++ Sharing the Installation between 32Bit and 64Bit Clients

%ICON{hand}% This section is for System Administrators that require the OSG Client Package to be setup in a _shared_ location and which will be used by clients of different architectures. In this case a 32Bit installation has to be forced on the 64Bit clients using a command line option to %LINK_PACMAN%.

%NOTE% This procedure requires the installation of *32Bit Compatibility Libraries* on all 64Bit clients!

To _force_ the installation of the 32Bit OSG Client Package simply provide the =-pretend-arch i686= command line option to the =pacman= command:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# pacman %RED%-pretend-arch i686%ENDCOLOR% -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client

<!-- Marco
This section explains how to prepare a 32 bit installation that could work in a mixed 32/64 bit environment.

Some software in OSG-Client is architecture dependent: compiled binaries, libraries including python compiled libraries.
In mixed environments:
   * A 64 bit OS can support both 64 and 32 bit applications and libraries
   * A 32 bit OS supports only 32 bit applications and libraries
   * Python compiled libraries, e.g. LFC binding included in OSG client, have to match the interpreter. I.e. 64bit Python requires 64bit bindings, 32bit Python requires 32bit bindings (therefore 32bit OSG client).
If one of the above is violated you get errors often difficult to identify. 

The simplest way to have a general installation is to install everything 32 bit.
Follow these step to change the installation procedure described in the page:
   * You need to install 32bit compatibility libraries on all your 64bit OSes.
   * During each Pacman installation add the option =-pretend-arch i686=, e.g. ==pacman -pretend-arch i686 -get !http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client==. Pacman is actually caching this setting, so it is important you use =-pretend-arch i686= the first time you install something in that directory (Pacman cache). [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/installation_advanced.html#pretend_32][Here]] is VDT documentation about -pretend-arch i686.
   * NOTE: the environment variable =export VDT_PRETEND_32=1= that one was set before the VDT installation is not working anymore.
   * If you need Python 32 bit you can install on your own or use: ==pacman -get !http://www.mwt2.org/caches/:Python32bit==. The Python delivered is Python 2.4 (C API 1012, required by _lfc.so) and it is compiled on a SL4.7. The Pacman installation can be in its own directory or on top of OSG-Client (recommended if you installed it 32 bit and you will need Python 32 bit only for it). If you wonder no -pretend-arch i686 is needed because this package is only 32 bit, anyway it is fine if you added the option.

---++ Service Activation

The %LINK_GLOSSARY_VDT% provides two types of services. Services that will be started periodically using =cron= and services that will be started using the =init.d= daemon. To see a list of services registered by the OSG client package use =vdt-control=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-control %RED%-list%ENDCOLOR%
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl               | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
vdt-rotate-logs         | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
vdt-update-certs        | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
condor                  | init   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
globus-ws               | init   | do not enable
</pre>

Use =vdt-control= to add the registered services to =cron= and =init.d=: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-control %RED%-on%ENDCOLOR%
enabling cron service fetch-crl... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
enabling cron service vdt-rotate-logs... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
enabling cron service vdt-update-certs... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
enabling init service condor... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
skipping init service 'globus-ws' -- marked as disabled
</pre>

You can use =crontab= to verify that the necessary entries have been add to cron. The start times will be _randomized_ in order to avoid all grid resources contacting the server at the same time.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# crontab -l
59 3,9,15,21 * * * /opt/osg-ctp/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.6/fetch-crl.cron
0 0 * * * /opt/osg-ctp/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
14 * * * * /opt/osg-ctp/vdt/sbin/vdt-update-certs-wrapper --vdt-install /opt/osg-ctp --called-from-cron
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

To remove all registered services from =cron= and =init.d=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# vdt-control %RED%-off%ENDCOLOR%
disabling init service globus-ws... ok
disabling init service condor... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
disabling cron service vdt-update-certs... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
disabling cron service vdt-rotate-logs... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
disabling cron service fetch-crl... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

We recommend to add the environment definitions in =%INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh= to the system wide profile definitions in =/etc/profile.d/=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se osg-ctp]# ln -s %INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh /etc/profile.d/osg-client.sh
</pre>

Alternatively you can add =%INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh= to be sourced at login in =~/.bash_profile=.

---++ Testing the Client
Follow the instructions and examples in Documentation.UsingTheGrid to use the commands in OSG client and test them. 

In short you can follow these steps:
   * have your grid user certificate certificate ready
   * =source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh= to set the OSG client environment 
   * create a LINK_GLOSSARY_GRID_PROXY to test that your certificate is valid
   * create a LINK_GLOSSARY_VOMS_PROXY: this requires a VOMS server that you can use and will test other libraries and also your correct syncronization
   * authenticate to a running LINK_GLOSSARY_CE that you are authorized to use, e.g.: =globusrun -a -r cmsosgce3.fnal.gov=
   * transfer a file from a working LINK_GLOSSARY_SE  that you are authorized to use, e.g.: =globus-url-copy =
A series of validation tests of the client tools can be found in the ValidateClients documentation. These basic tests include querying services, submitting jobs, and transfering files.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * NA - changed a lot - CESimpleTest is testing CE
   * * again, link to the appropriate section CESimpleTest
%ENDTWISTY%

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * NA - changed a lot - CESimpleTest is testing CE
   * * the explaination is misleading. The software is already configured. 
* point the user to CESimpleTest that does the same thing as you are trying, we don't need to duplicate the content
%ENDTWISTY%

---++ Debugging Information
If you encounter any problems, review the *vdt-install.log* file for obvious error messages; you will be asked to send that file to experts as the first step for almost any debugging.

You can view what has been installed by running ==vdt-version==.  
%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Click to see how the output looks like."
hidelink="Hide output"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="screen">
> source <i>your-osg-client-dir</i>/setup.(c)sh
> vdt-version

You have installed a subset of VDT version 2.0.0p5:

---++ Updating the Client
%WARNING% These instructions refer *ONLY TO THE UPDATE OF THE CLIENT*.  Do not use them for other packages like CE and SE.

%NOTE% Client installation and configuration is relatively straightforward; it may be easier and faster to remove your old install and do a fresh installation.

To update OSG Client you must first update the VDT packages with the VDT updater, then you can use Pacman for the rest:
   * Turn off the services (in clients they are normally already off). You have to be root to use =vdt-control=; if this is a personal installation ignore the vdt-control statements <pre class="screen">cd $VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
vdt-control --off
</pre>
   * Get the latest updater:<pre class="screen">
pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre> 
   * NOTE: if you don't have the VDT-Updater, run the following command to get it:<pre class="screen">pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:VDT-Updater
</pre>
   * Run the updater: <pre class="screen">vdt/update/vdt-updater      --skip-backup-check
</pre>
      * Answer yes when asked to accept the updates
      * Answer no if asked to modify the certificate management
   * Update the rest (OSG-Client):<pre class="screen">pacman -update 
</pre>
   * Finish the update: <pre class="screen">vdt-post-install   # probably it will tell you that nothing needs to be fixed
vdt-control --on  #  (if desired to restart cron jobs) probably this is not necessary
</pre>
