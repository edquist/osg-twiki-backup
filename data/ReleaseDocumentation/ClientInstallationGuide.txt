---++ About this Document

This document covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools for grid users.  The OSG Client Package contains software to submit jobs and transfer data on the Open Science Grid. It includes:

   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_GLOBUS% toolkit for authorization, file transfer, and small-scale job submission.
   * CA certificates and CRLs (part of the grid authentication and authorization system).
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% for job submission and workflow management.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM% protocol client tools for file transfer and data management.

%NOTE%This page does not cover the usage of the client tools! For user documentation check Documentation.UsingTheGrid

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * ALL DONE - some links do not work
   * * link to Globus Toolkit
* link to Condor or the Glossary term Condor
* link to SRM Glossary term
* add link to where the usage of the client tools will be discussed 
%ENDTWISTY%

---+++ Applicable Versions

This guide covers the installation of OSG-Client for *OSG-%OSG_VERSION%*.

---+++ Engineering Considerations.

A heavily used (more than 2000 sustained running jobs) OSG client can use quite a few resources and may need its own node.

In order to set up any persistent service - certificate updates, CRL updates, or starting Condor at boot time - you will need to install the client as root.  If you install as root you must install in a directory accessible for all users; if root installs into a directory that is not world-readable, the install process will fail.

Normally the installation chooses the right packages for your platform. If you have a mixed cluster and desire a single OSG-Client installation to share with hosts with 32 bit OS and hosts with 64 bit OS you may want to force the installation of the 32 bit version also if you are performing it on a 64 bit machine. Expand the section below if you are interested.
%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show how to install the 32 bit version on a 64 bit OS"
hidelink="Hide the instructions"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
Some software in OSG-Client is architecture dependent (compiled binaries, libraries including python compiled libraries -like LFC-, ...).
The simplest way to have a general installation is to install all 32 bit.
Follow these step to change the installation procedure described in the page:
   * You need to install 32bit compatibility libraries for your OS.
   * During each Pacman installation add the option =-pretend-arch i686= (e.g. =pacman -pretend-arch i686 -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client= ). Pacman is actually caching this setting, so it is important you use =-pretend-arch i686= the first time you install something in that directory (Pacman cache). [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/installation_advanced.html#pretend_32][Here]] is VDT documentation about -pretend-arch i686.
   * NOTE: the environment variable: export VDT_PRETEND_32=1 (that was set before the VDT installation) is not working anymore.
   * If you need Python 32 bit you can install on your own or use: =pacman -get http://www.mwt2.org/caches/:Python32bit=. The Python delivered is Python 2.4 (C API 1012 required by _lfc.so) and it is compiled on a SL4.7. The Pacman installation can be in its own directory or on top of OSG-Client (recommended if you installed it 32 bit and you will need Python 32 bit only for it). If you wonder no -pretend-arch i686 is needed because this package is only 32 bit, anyway it is fine if you added the option.
%ENDTWISTY%

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
* avoid using () inline of sentence. Use new sentence if necessary or delete.

---+++ Help!

If a problem occurs during installation, [[InstallHelpProcedure][please use this page]] to get assistance.

---++ Requirements

   1 *WARNING* If you already have an OSG-Client installed, its presence (in the installation directory or in the environment) might corrupt this installation attempt.  Verify that you are installing into an empty directory and the $VDT_LOCATION environment variable isn't already set; you may have to log in to a fresh shell or remove something from your shell's profile. 
      * If $VDT_LOCATION is already set, you may receive indecipherable errors while attempting this install.  You may get no errors at all, but end up with an unusable software stack.
      * It is OK to have other installation of OSG-Client on your disks but should be in different directories and the setup file should not have been sourced.
   1 This process assumes that you have already obtained a grid certificate ([[CertificateGet][check here]] if you need one) from an OSG-recognized Certificate Authority and joined one of the OSG VOs (Virtual Organizations). If you have not, you will not be able to easily test the resulting install.
   1 See the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported operating systems]] for system requirements.  
      * If you do a non-root install, make sure that you own your =$HOME/.globus= directory and its permissions are 755.  
   1 Have the pacman software installed and set up in your environment.  Refer to [[PacmanInstall][Pacman install]] for installation and consult [[PacmanBestPractices][the Pacman Best practices]] if you have trouble. Pacman %PACMAN_VERSION% is required. Installation is likely to fail with earlier versions.

   * * create a numbered list here that summarize the major steps that will follow, so the user gets an overview.
%ENDTWISTY%

create an directory 
Create an installation directory, assign its path to $INSTALL_DIR and change to it: <pre class="screen">export INSTALL_DIR=/opt/osg-client

Next, run the installation command
Install the client package from the OSG software cache. Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache and accept the licenses, answer =yall= and =y=: <pre class="screen">pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.
                                         
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2 has been installed.

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

Update the environment and run the post installation script:<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by invoking =vdt-version=.

Now install the Certification Authorities (CA) certificates and Certificates Revocation Lists (CRLs) (CA installation):<pre>source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
</pre>

Enable a service to maintain updated your certificates and CRLs and to rotate log files:<pre>vdt-control --enable fetch-crl  vdt-rotate-logs vdt-update-certs
</pre>
There are more optional services available: for Condor-G submissions =condor= is needed. Never run or enable =globus-ws=: it is an legacy artifact of the VDT install process. <pre>vdt-control --enable condor
</pre>
To start the the service as regular user:<pre>vdt-control --non-root --on
</pre>
or as root:<pre>vdt-control --on
</pre>

This gives you self-contained installation with standard OSG certificates with services to maintain all updated. 
CA certificates need to be maintained because CRLs expire frequently (with expired CAs or CRLs your authentications will fail). 
Services are not mandatory.
No running services is fine for testing and local casual, but the certificates will not be automatically updated. You can update them manually by re-invoking =vdt-ca-manage= or by running =vdt-update-certs=, but requires labor and is not reliable because you may forget. 
Therefore the services above are recommended. 

For more options on the type and location of the certificates (e.g. to install the certificates in the system directory =/etc/grid-security=) see the [[#Alternatives_for_CA_certificates][section on alternatives for CA and CRLs]] below.

For Condor-G submissions =condor= are needed. Never run or enable =globus-ws=; it is an legacy artifact of the VDT install process.  Turning on all enabled services is done by, ==vdt-contol --on==.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * NA - moved below as requested
   * * how do I know that it works? Validation?
%ENDTWISTY%


---++ Advanced installation options
These sections present special configurations, explain concepts in detail or describe special use case.

---+++ CA Certificate Configuration

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
* remind me what a CA certificate is and why this is important
* the vdt-ca-manage command needs a help page. An explaining would also be nice about what it does.
%ENDTWISTY%

Some last steps have to be performed to configure the CA certificates.

Run the =vdt-ca-manage= command.  To do this, you need to make two decisions.
Should certificates be installed to:
   * *root*: (Can only be done as root user) Install certificates system-wide into /etc/grid-security/certificates
   * *local*: Install certificates only into the local install directory
What set of CA certificates should be used?
   * *osg*: The IGTF-accredited CAs plus additional non-accredited CAs that OSG VOs may use
   * *vdt*: The IGTF-accredited CAs only.
A common usage case is given below, where the OSG certificates are place in the local installation:
<pre class="screen">
source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh 
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
</pre>

---+++ Alternatives for CA certificates and CRLs
=vdt-ca-manage= allows to pick the desired CA certificates and install them in an arbitrary location, private or shared with other grid softwares.
A complete reference on available certificate sets and where to put the certificates, including an arbitrary location, is available [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/man/vdt-ca-manage.html][on the VDT site]].
The default installation above is self contained. This section covers two other common options to install the OSG CA certificates. You can use one of these instead of the CA installation in the  instructions above.

---++++!! Install in /etc/grid-security/certificates
You must install as root to use this system directory:<pre>source /opt/wlcg-client/setup.sh
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location root --url osg
vdt-post-install
</pre>
This installation by default enables the periodic update of certificates and CRLs.

---++++!! Link an existing CA installation
You can use an existing CA installation (owned by an other package) on the host or mounted in a shared directory (e.g. via NSF). 
If several grid softwares share the same CA installation it is important that one is the owner and runs the services to update it and all the other only link to it (without changing the content).
Let's assume that  =$CACERTDIR= contains the path of the certificate directory, e.g. =/your/cacertdir= or =/etc/grid-security/certificates=.
To link to the existing CA installation:<pre>source /opt/wlcg-client/setup.sh
ln -s $CACERTDIR $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA
ln -s $CACERTDIR $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
</pre>
If you don't make the links above your wlcg-client may work only partially.
<!-- It is important to  link correctly the certificate directory even if they are already available on the host. The default system wide location in Globus and VDT is =/etc/grid-security/certificates= but you may have a different one (an arbitrary =/your/cacertdir=). 
-->

---+++  Firewall Considerations

Some Grid job initiation and management operations require call backs to the client machine, accordingly *any* firewall on the host (or an external firewall affecting the host) can possibly break an installation.  *If you have a firewall, read this section*; otherwise, ignore it.

   * If your client host is behind a firewall and not registered in DNS, assign your client's ip-address to the =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= variable: 
      * <pre class="screen">  export GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=<i>your-ip-address</i> </pre>
   * If your client is behind a firewall blocking ephemeral ports, an ephemeral port range should be set aside for use and opened for incoming connections.  Opening the port range may depend on your firewall implementation. If you are doing a personal non-root installation, check with your administrator to determine which ports are open for you to use.  Then, identifying the port range in the client tools is done in two places (numbers shown here are just examples):
      * Specify the GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE and GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE  variables (to set the inbound and outbound available port ranges, see ComputeElementFirewalls for more information) in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh (and vdt-local-setup.csh) script: <pre class="screen">
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=20000,22000
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=23000,25000 
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
</pre>
      * Specify range in for use by Condor-g in the $CONDOR_CONFIG file ( *Note:* condor must be restarted):  <pre class="screen">
HIGHPORT = 22000 
LOWPORT  = 20000
</pre>

---+++ Install 32bit on 64bit OS (Full 32bit installation and Python 32bit)
wlcg-client and !DQ2Client are fully compatible with both 64 or 32 bit Operation Systems. 
<!--
Older !DQ2Client included only the 32bit version of some libraries (!MySQL python bindings) therefore there may be 'library not found' errors with a 64bit Python if the binding is not installed in the system. The newer !DQ2Client is not using !MySQL access to the catalogs anymore. 
-->
Normally wlcg-client matches the platform (OS) in the installation host. In mixed environments:
   * A 64 bit OS can support both 64 and 32 bit applications and libraries
   * A 32 bit OS supports only 32 bit applications and libraries
   * Python compiled libraries (e.g. LFC binding included in wlcg-client) have to match the interpreter. E.g. 64bit Python requires 64bit bindings, 32bit Python requires 32bit bindings (therefore 32bit wlcg-client).
If one of the above is violated you get errors often difficult to identify. 
The simple solution for mixed environments (32/64bit OSes with a single shared wlcg-client installation) is to install everything in 32bit version:
   * You need to install 32bit compatibility libraries on 64bit OSes (e.g. [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/RPMcompatSLC4][Here]] is a list for SLC4) 
   * During each Pacman installation  add the option =-pretend-arch i686= (e.g. =pacman -pretend-arch i686 -get wlcg-client=) to force a 32bit installation. Pacman is actually caching this setting, so it is important you use =-pretend-arch i686= the first time you install something in that directory (Pacman cache). [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/installation_advanced.html#pretend_32][Here]] is VDT documentation about =-pretend-arch i686=.
   * NOTE: the environment variable: =export VDT_PRETEND_32=1= (that was set before the VDT installation) is not working anymore.
   * If you need Python 32 bit you can install on your own or use: <tt>pacman -get http://www.mwt2.org/caches/:Python32bit</tt>. The Python delivered is Python 2.4 (C API 1012 required by =_lfc.so=) and it is compiled on a SL4.7. The Pacman installation can be in its own directory or on top of WLCG-Client (recommended if you installed it 32 bit and you will need Python 32 bit only for it). If you wonder, no =-pretend-arch i686= is needed because this package is only 32 bit, anyway it is fine if you added the option.



---++ Service Startup/Shutdown

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * DONE
   * * this section must move up before the verification
%ENDTWISTY%

This section applies only to clients installed as root.

Even though this is the client package, some services remain, such as:
   * Hourly CRL updates
   * Hourly log rotation
   * Nightly CA updates
   * Condor daemons for workflow management (only for root installations)
The tool for starting and stopping the services is =vdt-control=.  To run these services, login as root and source the setup script:


To startt/stop the services as root: <pre class="screen">source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh
vdt-control --on
vdt-control --off
</pre>

To startt/stop the services as non root user you must own the installation and add the =--non-root= option: <pre class="screen">source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh
vdt-control --non-root --on
vdt-control --non-root --off
</pre>

You can determine which services are configured by running =vdt-control --list=.

---++ Testing the Client
Follow the instructions and examples in Documentation.UsingTheGrid to use the commands in OSG client and test them. 

In short you can follow these steps:
   * have your grid user certificate certificate ready
   * =source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh= to set the OSG client environment 
   * create a LINK_GLOSSARY_GRID_PROXY to test that your certificate is valid
   * create a LINK_GLOSSARY_VOMS_PROXY: this requires a VOMS server that you can use and will test other libraries and also your correct syncronization
   * authenticate to a running LINK_GLOSSARY_CE that you are authorized to use, e.g.: =globusrun -a -r cmsosgce3.fnal.gov=
   * transfer a file from a working LINK_GLOSSARY_SE  that you are authorized to use, e.g.: =globus-url-copy =
A series of validation tests of the client tools can be found in the ValidateClients documentation. These basic tests include querying services, submitting jobs, and transfering files.

---++ Updating the Client
%WARNING% These instructions refer *ONLY TO THE UPDATE OF THE CLIENT*.  Do not use them for other packages like CE and SE.

%NOTE% Client installation and configuration is relatively straightforward; it may be easier and faster to remove your old install and do a fresh installation.

To update OSG Client you must first update the VDT packages with the VDT updater, then you can use Pacman for the rest:
   * Turn off the services (in clients they are normally already off). You have to be root to use =vdt-control=; if this is a personal installation ignore the vdt-control statements <pre class="screen">cd $VDT_LOCATION                                                                                                                                           
source setup.sh
vdt-control --off
</pre>
   * Get the latest updater:<pre class="screen">
pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre> 
   * NOTE: if you don't have the VDT-Updater, run the following command to get it:<pre class="screen">pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:VDT-Updater
</pre>
   * Run the updater: <pre class="screen">vdt/update/vdt-updater      --skip-backup-check
</pre>
      * Answer yes when asked to accept the updates
      * Answer no if asked to modify the certificate management
   * Update the rest (OSG-Client):<pre class="screen">pacman -update 
</pre>
   * Finish the update: <pre class="screen">vdt-post-install   # probably it will tell you that nothing needs to be fixed
vdt-control --on  #  (if desired to restart cron jobs) probably this is not necessary
</pre>
