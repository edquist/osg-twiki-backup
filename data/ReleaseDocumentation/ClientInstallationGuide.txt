---++ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users and system administrators. It covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools Package. This package is required on every host used by grid users to submit jobs or transfer data on the OSG. It is also mandatory to be installed by grid resource administrators on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%.  

The OSG Cient Tools Package includes:

   * the %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% providing client tools for authorization, data transfer and job submission.
   * a list of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCertificate][Certificates]] trusted by the OSG.
   * the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCRL][Certificate Revocation List]] and tools to keep it current.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% client tools for job submission and workflow management.
   * client tools to access a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM% provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%.

%NOTE%This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][here]].

---++!! Engineering Considerations.

The OSG Client Tools Package is required on hosts used to submit jobs to the Open Science Grid. We recommend to install the OSG Client Tools on a _dedicated_ job submission host (1.) for large scale job submissions to production resources on the OSG. Grid users may install the package as _non-root_ users. If the client tools are to be shared among users on the job submission host, the installation should be performed by the _root_ user. We strongly recommend to use a [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Public_IP_Address_and_DNS][public IP address and a fully qualified domain name]] for the job submission host.

System administrators installing the OSG Client Tools in a shared location that serves hosts of different architectures should consider to [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Sharing_the_Installation_between][force]] the installation of the %RED%i686%ENDCOLOR% version.


---++!! Getting Help!

To get assistance please use [[InstallHelpProcedure][this page]].


---++ Requirements

   1 verify that your operating system is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]].
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION%.
   1 except for worker node installations a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required.
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required.

---++ Installation Procedure

<!-- define Twiki variable for use on this document
   * Local INSTALL_DIR = /opt/osg-ctp
   * Local INSTALL_LOGIN = user
   * Local INSTALL_HOST = client
   * Local INSTALL_HOST_FQDN = client.ligo.caltech.edu
-->

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 deactivate an existing installation
   1 create an empty installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the OSG Client Tools Package
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 configure logfile rotation and automatic updates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 Enable %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% to support Condor-G Job Submissions

---+++ Deactivate an existing Installation

Before you proceed you must [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][deactivate]] an existing installation. Make sure to %RED%unset%ENDCOLOR% the =$VDT_LOCATION= environment variable.

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# echo $VDT_LOCATION 
/usr/local/ITB-BeStMan
%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# unset VDT_LOCATION
</pre>

---+++ Create the Installation Directory

Create an empty installation directory and change into it. Make sure the directory is world readable if the installation is to be shared by grid users: 

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% ~]# mkdir -p %INSTALL_DIR%
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% ~]# cd %INSTALL_DIR%
</pre>

---+++ Use Pacman to install the OSG Client Tools Package

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to _trust the cache_ and _accept the license_, answer =yall= and =y= if you want to do so.

<pre class="screen">

%ENDTWISTY%

---+++ Install the CA Certificates and the CRL

The OSG distributes a number of root certificates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authorities]] that issue certificates to their members. By installing these certificates you establish a chain of trust with each of the certificate authorities and allow their members to access your resource. The %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% is used to inform your resource about individual certificates that have been revoked.

We will use the =vdt-ca-manage= command to download the CA Certificates and the Certificate Revocation List. The command line option =--location local= copies the CA certificates into the subdirectory =%INSTALL_DIR%/globus/share/certificates=. 

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca --url %RED%osg%ENDCOLOR% --location %RED%local%ENDCOLOR%
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%INSTALL_DIR%'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

%NOTE% The default location for the CA Certificates and the CRL is below =/etc/grid-security=. Use =--location root= 

---+++ Configure Logfile Rotation and Automatic Updates

To keep your [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% current we will add an entry to =cron= requesting periodic updates. We also recommend to setup logfile rotation using =vdt-control= at the command line:

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-control --enable %RED%fetch-crl vdt-update-certs vdt-rotate-logs%ENDCOLOR% 
running 'vdt-register-service --name fetch-crl --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-update-certs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-rotate-logs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

_Non-root users_ have to append the =--non-root= command line option as a safety measure in order to prevent having duplicate cron jobs installed:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-control --enable fetch-crl vdt-update-certs vdt-rotate-logs %RED%--non-root%ENDCOLOR% 
running 'vdt-register-service --name fetch-crl --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-update-certs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-rotate-logs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

%NOTE% =vdt-control= will only _register_ the services requested to be run by =cron=. To create the necessary entries in =crontab=, the service still has to be [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][activated]].

---+++ Enable Condor to support Condor-G Job Submissions

Large scale production job submissions require a capable scheduler submitting jobs to grid resources and monitoring their status. Enabling support for %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% on the submission host is all that is required to create a local grid queue on your submission host: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-control -enable condor
running 'vdt-register-service --name condor --enable'... ok
</pre>

%NOTE% This will copy the =condor= script to =/etc/init.d= and requires _root_ privileges. Please follow instructions below if you are a _non-root_ user!

As a _non-root_ user you may manually _start_ and _stop_ Condor. If necessary adjust the variable =LOCK= in the _local_ configuration file =%INSTALL_DIR%/condor/local.%INSTALL_HOST%/condor_config.local=: 

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]$ cat %INSTALL_DIR%/condor/local.%INSTALL_HOST%/condor_config.local | grep LOCK
LOCK = %INSTALL_DIR%/condor/condor-lock
</pre>

_Start_ Condor by using the =condor_master= command:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]$ condor_master %RED%-off%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

_Stop_ Condor by using the =condor_off= command:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]$ condor_off %RED%-master%ENDCOLOR%
Sent "Kill-Daemon" command for "master" to local master
</pre>

---+++ Advanced Configuration Options

Completing the steps outlined above will install a fully functional OSG Client. The following section discusses optional and advanced configuration options.   

---++++ CA Certificates and CRL

The program =vdt-ca-manage= provides convenient options to configure which [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authority]] to trust and how to install the CA Certificates on your resource.

---+++++ System-wide Installation

The default location for CA Certificates is =/etc/grid-security/certificates= and should preferably be used to make the certificates system-wide available. This requires _root_ privileges: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca %RED%--location root%ENDCOLOR% --url osg
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%INSTALL_DIR%'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

---+++++ Use an existing CA Installation

It is often practical to reuse an existing %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% Installation instead of creating a new installation using =vdt-ca-manage=:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# source setup.sh
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca %RED%--location /etc/grid-security/certificates%ENDCOLOR% --no-update
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%INSTALL_DIR%'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

%ICON{hand}% The command line option =--location= points to the existing installation. The command creates a softlink from =%INSTALL_DIR%/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to =/etc/grid-security/certificates=.

---+++++ Provide and Install a custom CA Package

If a custom %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% certificates package was made available on a web server, it can be used to be installed instead of the OSG specific CA package using the =--url= option on the command line to =vdt-ca-manage=:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# source setup.sh
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca --location /full/path/to/CAinstallation --url http://your.web.server/path/to/CA_distribution
</pre>

By default this enables the periodic update of the CA Certificates and the CRL.

---++++  Firewall Considerations

The %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% require the client host to _allow_ inbound and outbound network connections. This section describes what additional configuration steps have to be taken if the client host is located behind a firewall. For a more detailed description on firewalls consult [[ComputeElementFirewalls][this]] document.

---+++++ Public IP Address and DNS

The client host needs to use a _public_ IP address and not be be located within a private network in order to be connected by remote resources. Please make sure that the client host uses a public IP address and is assigned a fully qualified domain name:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# hostname -f
%RED%%INSTALL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# nslookup %INSTALL_HOST_FQDN%
Server:		131.215.125.1
Address:	131.215.125.1#53

Name:           %RED%%INSTALL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
Address:        %RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

If the client host is not assigned a fully qualified domain name, you can assign the _public IP address_ to the =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# echo "GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=%RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%" >> %INSTALL_DIR%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# source setup.sh
</pre> 

%NOTE% It is possible to use a client host that is located inside a private network using Network Address Translation. In this case the gatekeeper must be configured to forward incoming connections to the client host. The =$GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable must be set to the gatekeeper address. This procedure is currently not documented.

---+++++ Globus Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% can be configured to only use a specified range of TCP ports on the client host for inbound (=$GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=) and outbound (=$GLOBUS_TCP_PORTRANGE=) connections.

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# echo "export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%20000,22499%ENDCOLOR%" >> %INSTALL_DIR%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# echo "export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%22500,25000%ENDCOLOR%" >> %INSTALL_DIR%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++++ Condor Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% will only use a specified range of TCP ports for inbound and outbound connections on the client host that is configured in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# echo $CONDOR_CONFIG 
%INSTALL_DIR%/condor/etc/condor_config
</pre>

Please un-comment and adjust the definitions for =LOWPORT= and =HIGHPORT= in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%LOWPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#LOWPORT = 9600
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%HIGHPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#HIGHPORT = 9700 
</pre>

Restart Condor as the _root_ user in order for the settings to take effect:

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# /etc/init.d/condor stop
Shutting down Condor
Sent "Kill-Daemon" command for "master" to local master
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# /etc/init.d/condor start
Starting up Condor
</pre>


---++++ Sharing the Installation between 32Bit and 64Bit Clients

%ICON{hand}% This section is for System Administrators that require the OSG Client Package to be setup in a _shared_ location and which will be used by clients of different architectures. In this case a 32Bit installation has to be forced on the 64Bit clients using a command line option to %LINK_PACMAN%.

%NOTE% This procedure requires the installation of *32Bit Compatibility Libraries* on all 64Bit clients!

To _force_ the installation of the 32Bit OSG Client Package simply provide the =-pretend-arch i686= command line option to the =pacman= command:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# pacman %RED%-pretend-arch i686%ENDCOLOR% -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
Do you want to add [http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
...
</pre>

Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       
All prerequisite checks are satisfied.

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
                                                                              
The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.    
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2.10 has been installed.
%ENDTWISTY%

and continue to follow the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Install_the_CA_Certificates_and][instructions]].

---++ Service Activation and Deactivation

The %LINK_GLOSSARY_VDT% provides two types of services. Services that will be started periodically using =cron= and services that will be started using the =init.d= daemon. To see a list of services registered by the OSG client package use =vdt-control=:

<pre class="screen">
[%INSTALL_LOGIN%@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-control %RED%-list%ENDCOLOR%
Service                 | <b>Type</b>   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl               | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
vdt-rotate-logs         | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
vdt-update-certs        | cron   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
condor                  | init   | %GREEN%enable%ENDCOLOR%
globus-ws               | init   | do not enable
</pre>

%NOTE% You may _activate_ and _deactivate_ registered =cron= services as a _non-root_ user. Services of *Type* =init= will require _root_ privileges!

Use =vdt-control= to _activate_ the registered services and add them to =cron= and =init.d= as the _root_ user: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-control %RED%-on%ENDCOLOR%
enabling cron service fetch-crl... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
enabling cron service vdt-rotate-logs... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
enabling cron service vdt-update-certs... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
enabling init service condor... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
skipping init service 'globus-ws' -- marked as disabled
</pre>

You can use =crontab= to verify that the necessary entries have been add to cron. The start times will be _randomized_ in order to avoid all grid resources contacting the server at the same time.

To _deactivate_ all registered services and remove them from =cron= and =init.d=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# vdt-control %RED%-off%ENDCOLOR%

We recommend to add the environment definitions in =%INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh= to the system wide profile definitions in =/etc/profile.d/=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@%INSTALL_HOST% %INSTALL_DIR%]# ln -s %INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh /etc/profile.d/osg-client.sh
</pre>

Alternatively you can add =%INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh= to be sourced at login in =~/.bash_profile=.

---++ Testing the Client

This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][here]].

To simply test the functionality of your installation:

   * prepare your environment by sourcing =%INSTALL_DIR%/setup.sh= 
   * make sure your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is installed on the client host
   * make sure you [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][activated]] the installation
   * create a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_Grid_Prox][grid-proxy]] to test that your certificate is valid
   * create a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_VOMS_Prox][voms-proxy]]
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][authenticate]] with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Job_Submission_using_GRAM][submit a job]] using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Data_Transfer_Test][transfer data]] using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%
