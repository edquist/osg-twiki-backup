%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Specific comments are below. Here are general comments.
   * I edited directly the document for small corrections. %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%
   * instead of "here" would be easier to say where (e.g. in the debug section) but may be a stylistic difference %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%
   * The document sometime is redundant: we will do this … then you do %GREEN%Can you be more specific?%ENDCOLOR%
   * The document contains explanation (e.g. CA and CRL): the scope should be to explain how to install, not to generally educate-explain (I've been corrected about it)  %GREEN%I disagree. If I speak about the "Compute Element" in the text, I can possibly link to a dozen pages that deal with compute elements. Only one of those is the installation page which may or may not be relevant to the user. Therefor I choose the only safe option, the explanation in the Glossary.%ENDCOLOR%
   * Why not make the advanced installation options a level 2 subsection? Would separate it more from standard installation and provide more depths to its elements %GREEN%Because it is part of the installation, though an optional one. Therefor it should be listed below the installation section.%ENDCOLOR%
   * There is no full installation example at the end %GREEN%The full installation example was invented early on. I don't think it is very useful to capture the entire output that is displayed in pieces on the page already. It is just duplicated work.%ENDCOLOR%

%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users and system administrators. It covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools Package. This package is required on every host used by grid users to submit jobs, transfer data, or interact otherwise with the OSG. The [[WorkerNodeClient][Worker Node client]] is not a valid substitute for this package and the OSG Client cannot replace the Worker node client in the batch jobs environment on %LINK_GLOSSARY_WN% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%.  

The OSG Cient Tools Package includes:

   * the %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% providing client tools for authorization, data transfer and job submission.
   * a list of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA]] [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCertificate][Certificates]] trusted by the OSG.
   * the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCRL][Certificate Revocation List]] and tools to keep it current.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% client tools for job submission and workflow management.
   * client tools to access a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SRM% provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE%.

%NOTE%This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][here]].

---++!! Engineering Considerations.

The OSG Client Tools Package is required on hosts used to submit jobs to the Open Science Grid. We recommend to install the OSG Client Tools on a _dedicated_ job submission host for large scale job submissions to production resources on the OSG. Grid users may install the package as _non-root_ users. If the client tools are to be shared among users on the job submission host, the installation should be performed by the _root_ user. We strongly recommend to use a [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Public_IP_Address_and_DNS][public IP address and a fully qualified domain name]] for shared job submission hosts.

System administrators installing the OSG Client Tools in a shared location that serves hosts of mixed x86_64 and i686 architectures should consider to [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Sharing_the_Installation_between][force]] the installation of the version for %RED%i686%ENDCOLOR% architecture.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Here:
   * what is (1.) after job submission host? %GREEN%Fixed%ENDCOLOR%
   * why recommend public IP? laptops on private networks work fine. we'd like to avoid users asking for public IPs for private client machines. %GREEN%Well, I don't think that job submissions from laptops and hosts with changing IPs is really working at all. Perhaps I am phrasing this wrong and it should say "fixed IP address". But still, in that case the submission host behind a network gatekeeper and a firewall must be able to receive incoming network connections. Doing job submissions from within a private network just adds yet another problem. That is why I don't say that the user has to do that, but that we strongly recommend it.%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Requirements

   1 verify that your operating system is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]].
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION% or later.
   1 if you enable Gram WS (disabled by default) a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required.
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Here:
   * some editing
   * host certificate is not required for most of the client. OSG client is generally not installed in WN
%ENDTWISTY%

---++ Installation Procedure

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 deactivate an existing installation
   1 create an empty installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the OSG Client Tools Package
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 configure logfile rotation and automatic updates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 Enable %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% to support Condor-G Job Submissions

---+++ Deactivate an existing Installation

Before you proceed you must [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Deactivation][deactivate]] an existing installation. Make sure to start the installation with a clean environment. If VDT_LOCATION is in your environment you probably need to log-in again and make sure that no setup file is sourced in your login script.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
%GREEN% So what do we do about this deactivation? What is the recommended procedure? %ENDCOLOR%
A corrupted environment (path lib path, condor, ...) may cause trouble as well.
A clean environment is recommended.
Unset only VDT_LOCATION will not be sufficient
<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# echo $VDT_LOCATION 
/usr/local/ITB-BeStMan
%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# unset VDT_LOCATION
</pre>
I left this part but deactivating other installations is not always necessary. If thy do not compete for the same resources (e.g. update of the same certificate directory) then multiple installation can coexist on the same host.
%ENDTWISTY%


---+++ Create the Installation Directory

Create an empty installation directory and change into it. Make sure the directory is world readable if the installation is to be shared by grid users: 

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]# mkdir -p %UCL_CWD%
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% ~]# cd %UCL_CWD%
</pre>

---+++ Use Pacman to install the OSG Client Tools Package

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to _trust the caches_ and _accept the license_, answer =yall= and =y= to install OSG client.

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

INFO: The Globus-Base-Info-Client package is not supported on this platform
The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2.10 has been installed.
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

The installation logfile can be found in =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log=. To complete the installation update your environment and run the post installation script:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# source setup.sh
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-post-install 
Starting...
Done.
</pre>

Further information about the installation process and what software has been installed can be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Debugging_Information][here]].

---+++ Update the Environment

We recommend to add the environment definitions in =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= to the system wide profile definitions in =/etc/profile.d/=:

<pre class="screen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# ln -s %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh /etc/profile.d/osg-client.sh
</pre>

Alternatively you can add =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= to be sourced at login in =~/.bash_profile=. Or source the fine whenever needed.

---+++ Install the CA Certificates and the CRL

The OSG distributes a number of certificates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authorities]] that issue certificates to their members. By installing these certificates you establish a chain of trust with each of the certificate authorities and trust the servers and services certified by those authorities. The %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% is used to inform you about individual certificates that have been revoked.

We will use the =vdt-ca-manage= command to download the CA Certificates and the Certificate Revocation List. The command line option =--location local= copies the CA certificates into the subdirectory =%UCL_CWD%/globus/share/certificates=. 

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca --url %RED%osg%ENDCOLOR% --location %RED%local%ENDCOLOR%
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%UCL_CWD%'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
%GREEN% What part is confusing? Perhaps it should say, that by using --location-root certificates will be installed into /etc/grid-security?%ENDCOLOR%
This is incorrect and confusing. Eventually it should be substituted with a  pointer to below: For other options...
%NOTE% The default location for the CA Certificates and the CRL is below =/etc/grid-security=. Use =--location root= 
%ENDTWISTY%


---+++ Configure Logfile Rotation and Automatic Updates

To keep your [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL% current we will add an entry to =cron= requesting periodic updates. We also recommend to setup logfile rotation using =vdt-control= at the command line:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-control --enable %RED%fetch-crl vdt-update-certs vdt-rotate-logs%ENDCOLOR% 
running 'vdt-register-service --name fetch-crl --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-update-certs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
running 'vdt-register-service --name vdt-rotate-logs --enable'... %GREEN%ok%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

%NOTE% =vdt-control --enable= will only _register_ the services requested to be run by =cron=. To actually run the services and create the necessary entries in =crontab=, the services still have to be [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][activated]].

---+++ Enable Condor to support Condor-G Job Submissions

Large scale production job submissions require a capable scheduler submitting jobs to grid resources and monitoring their status. Enabling support for %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% on the submission host is all that is required to create a local grid queue on your submission host: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-control -enable condor
running 'vdt-register-service --name condor --enable'... ok
</pre>

%NOTE% This will copy the =condor= script to =/etc/init.d= and requires _root_ privileges. Please follow [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Manually_Start_and_Stop_Condor][these instructions]] if you are a _non-root_ user!

---+++ Advanced Configuration Options

Completing the steps outlined above will install a fully functional OSG Client. The following section discusses optional and advanced configuration options.   

---++++ CA Certificates and CRL

The program =vdt-ca-manage= provides convenient options to configure which [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][Certificate Authority]] to trust and how to install the CA Certificates on your resource.

---+++++ System-wide Installation
The location =/etc/grid-security/certificates= is one of the directories in the default search path for CA Certificates and it 
should preferably be used to make the certificates system-wide available when there are multiple VDT or Globus installations sharing the same certificates. This requires _root_ privileges: 

<pre class="screen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca %RED%--location root%ENDCOLOR% --url osg
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%UCL_CWD%'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

---+++++ Use an existing CA Installation

It is often practical to reuse an existing %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% Installation instead of creating a new installation using =vdt-ca-manage=:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# source setup.sh
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca %RED%--location /etc/grid-security/certificates%ENDCOLOR% --no-update
Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '%UCL_CWD%'

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

%ICON{hand}% The command line option =--location= points to the existing installation. The command creates a softlink from =%UCL_CWD%/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to =/etc/grid-security/certificates=.

---+++++ Provide and Install a custom CA Package

If a custom %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% certificates package was made available on a web server, it can be used to be installed instead of the OSG specific CA package using the =--url= option on the command line to =vdt-ca-manage=:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# source setup.sh
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# vdt-ca-manage setupca --location /full/path/to/CAinstallation --url http://your.web.server/path/to/CA_distribution
</pre>

By default this enables the periodic update of the CA Certificates and the CRL.

---++++  Firewall Considerations

The %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% require the client host to _allow_ inbound and outbound network connections. This section describes what additional configuration steps have to be taken if the client host is located behind a firewall. For a more detailed description on firewalls consult [[ComputeElementFirewalls][this]] document.

---+++++ Public IP Address and DNS
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Where did you find this?
I think it is incorrect. As long as you have outbound network connectivity you can perform most of the tasks. The only component that needs to be contacted back is condor and a Condor submit hosts works fine behind NAT. There is no gatekeeper involved.
%GREEN%Perhaps you are right. I haven't tried this myself. I chose the save option I know works in most cases (public IP). I think the job submission host inside a private network deserves its own section.%ENDCOLOR%
Later the Condor port range is confusing. Do I need to be root or not. If it is a personal client? %GREEN%You have no startup scripts for a personal condor in /etc/init.d. Therefor it lists root. The following NOTE explains how to do this as non-root%ENDCOLOR%
%ENDTWISTY%


The client host needs to use a _public_ IP address and not be be located within a private network in order to be connected by remote resources. Please make sure that the client host uses a public IP address and is assigned a fully qualified domain name:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# hostname -f
%RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# nslookup %UCL_HOST_FQDN%
Server:		131.215.125.1
Address:	131.215.125.1#53

Name:           %RED%%UCL_HOST_FQDN%%ENDCOLOR%
Address:        %RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

If the client host is not assigned a fully qualified domain name, you can assign the _public IP address_ to the =GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# echo "GLOBUS_HOSTNAME=%RED%131.215.114.49%ENDCOLOR%" >> %UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# source setup.sh
</pre> 

%NOTE% It is possible to use a client host that is located inside a private network using Network Address Translation. In this case the gatekeeper must be configured to forward incoming connections to the client host. The =$GLOBUS_HOSTNAME= environment variable must be set to the gatekeeper address. This procedure is currently not documented.

---+++++ Globus Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% can be configured to only use a specified range of TCP ports on the client host for inbound (=$GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=) and outbound (=$GLOBUS_TCP_PORTRANGE=) connections.

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# echo "export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%20000,22499%ENDCOLOR%" >> %UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# echo "export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%22500,25000%ENDCOLOR%" >> %UCL_CWD%/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++++ Condor Port Range

%LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% will only use a specified range of TCP ports for inbound and outbound connections on the client host that is configured in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# echo $CONDOR_CONFIG 
%UCL_CWD%/condor/etc/condor_config
</pre>

Please un-comment and adjust the definitions for =LOWPORT= and =HIGHPORT= in =$CONDOR_CONFIG=:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%LOWPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#LOWPORT = 9600
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# cat $CONDOR_CONFIG | grep \= | grep %RED%HIGHPORT%ENDCOLOR%
#HIGHPORT = 9700 
</pre>

Restart Condor as the _root_ user in order for the settings to take effect:

<pre class="screen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# /etc/init.d/condor stop
Shutting down Condor
Sent "Kill-Daemon" command for "master" to local master
[root@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# /etc/init.d/condor start
Starting up Condor
</pre>

%NOTE% Please follow [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Manually_Start_and_Stop_Condor][these instructions]] to restart Condor if you are a _non-root_ user!


---++++ Sharing the Installation between 32Bit and 64Bit Clients

%ICON{hand}% This section is for System Administrators that require the OSG Client Package to be setup in a _shared_ location and which will be used by hosts with different architectures, 32 and 64 bit. In this case and if the host used for the installation is 64Bit host, then a 32Bit installation has to be forced using a command line option to %LINK_PACMAN%.

%NOTE% This procedure requires the installation of *32Bit Compatibility Libraries* on all 64Bit clients!

To _force_ the installation of the 32Bit OSG Client Package simply provide the =-pretend-arch i686= command line option to the =pacman= command:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]# pacman %RED%-pretend-arch i686%ENDCOLOR% -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client

---+++ Manually Start and Stop Condor

A _non-root_ user doesn't have the permissions to add %LINK_GLOSSARY_CONDOR% to the =init= daemon. In this case Condor needs to be started and stopped _manually_ by the user.

_Start_ Condor by using the =condor_master= command:

<pre class="screen">
[%UCL_USER%@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]$ condor_master
</pre>

---++ Testing the Client

This document does not cover the usage of the client tools. An introduction how to use the OSG can be found [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][here]]. A more detailed description how to interact with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is located [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][here]].

To simply test the functionality of your installation:

   * prepare your environment by sourcing =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= 
   * make sure your [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is installed on the client host
   * make sure you [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide#Service_Activation_and_Deactivat][activated]] the installation
   * create a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_Grid_Prox][grid-proxy]] to test that your certificate is valid
   * create a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_VOMS_Prox][voms-proxy]]
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Mapping_Test][authenticate]] with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Job_Submission_using_GRAM][submit a job]] using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%
   * test to [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Data_Transfer_Test][transfer data]] using %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP%
