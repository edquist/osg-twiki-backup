There are many different Certificate Authorities that OSG sites can choose to recognize.  We recommend DOEGrids, as most OSG users are eligible for this.  This is the only CA for which we document the process.  For information on others, contact your [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php][VO Support Center]]. 

<!-- cOr follow the instructions in [[GetHostCertificates#Get_a_Personal_Grid_Certificate][Configuring Public Key Infrastructure]]. -->

---++ Get a certificate in your browser, export it and convert it

See [[Documentation/CertificateGet][How do I get or renew a DOEGrids Digital PKI/X509 Personal Certificate?]] for instructions on obtaining one and exporting it from your browser.  

Your certificate may not be in the right format for OSG work. Most grid certificates are in a certificate & key combination file (*.p12). We need to separate these into two files, =usercert.pem= and =userkey.pem=. The =userkey.pem= file contains the encrypted private key and should have restrictive permissions such that only the owner can read or write to it. The =usercert.pem= file is the certificate, containting the public key; it is not encrypted and can be distributed freely.

After you export it, you'll need to copy it to your =$HOME/.globus= directory on the host on which you'll be doing OSG work. Now log on to that host as yourself (not as root). Next, convert it to the right format for grid work. To convert it, run (replacing =${cert}= with the filename of your p12 cert file): 

<pre class="screen">
> cd $HOME/.globus
> openssl pkcs12 -in ${cert} -clcerts -nokeys -out usercert.pem
> openssl pkcs12 -in ${cert} -nocerts -out userkey.pem
</pre>
Then delete the p12 file (store it somewhere else, on a different machine for security reasons). Set permissions as follows:
<pre class="screen">
> chmod go-w  usercert.pem
> chmod go-rw userkey.pem
</pre>
In =$HOME/.globus= you should end up with:
<pre class="screen">
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root   1440 Aug 30 14:33 usercert.pem
-r--------  1 root    root   1176 Aug 30 14:32 userkey.pem
</pre>

---++ Alternate (non-browser) way to get user certificate

If you don't need a certificate for your browser, you can request one directly from the host where you'll be doing OSG work. Log in to the user account where you will normally initiate grid actions.  The commands below will place your certificate in the globus default location ( =~/.globus= ).  You should specify _OSG_ for the RA affiliation and also for the VO unless you already know the more appropriate values to use.

<pre class="screen">
> <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
> <b>cert-request -ou p</b>
</pre>
%RED%What type of interface do you get for inputting all the needed info (e.g., email address)?%ENDCOLOR%

Look for email notification that the certificate has been issued. Once you receive it, you can retrieve it with the following command, using the serial number given in the email notice.

<pre class="screen">
> <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
> <b>cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0xYYYY</i></b>
</pre>

---++ Update the VOMS information (e.g., after renewing): 
%RED%What about other VOMS instances? And do you have to do this initially too? ONLY after renewing? Clarify when it's needed. %ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="screen">
> <userinput>cd $HOME/.globus</userinput>
> <userinput>openssl x509 -in .globus/usercert.pem -subject -serial -noout</userinput>
</pre>

---++ Test your credentials:

%NOTE% This example was run using the Fermilab VO. Customize the commands for your VO's environment. 

%RED%How to generalize this so that it's not just for the osg-client?  In general, do you cd to $VDT_LOCATION and run setup.sh?  %BR%
And how do we represent the arguments "fermilab:/fermilab" shown below in a generic way?  Is it VO name, voms server name, what?
%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="screen">
> <userinput>cd osg-client</userinput>
> <userinput>source setup.sh</userinput>
> <userinput>voms-proxy-init -voms <replaceable>fermilab:/fermilab</replaceable></userinput>
Cannot find file or dir: $prefix/etc/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=E. Forrest Christian 802298
Enter GRID pass phrase:
Creating temporary proxy ............................................................................. Done
Contacting  fermigrid2.fnal.gov:15001 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=host/fermigrid2.fnal.gov] "fermilab" Done

</pre>

Now attempt to get a grid proxy by using either the =grid-proxy-init= or =voms-proxy-init= command (again, use your VO's VOMS information).

<pre class="screen">
> <userinput>voms-proxy-init -voms <replaceable>fermilab:/fermilab</replaceable></userinput>
Cannot find file or dir: $prefix/etc/vomses
Your identity: /DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Forrest Christian/USERID=forrestc

Creating proxy ............................................ Done
Your proxy is valid until Wed May 23 21:35:09 2007

</pre>

---++ Troubleshooting

If this doesn't work, check that the "gatekeeper" &mdash; the Grid component that accepts and executes remote jobs &mdash; can correctly authenticate you:
