%TOC%

---++ Rules for topics and templates
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+*<nop>Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!
   * All sections (level two and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * Exclude from the TOC all sections level three and below (=---+++=, =---++++=, etc.).  To accomplish this,  add =!!= before the title, e.g., =---+++ !!Title=.
   * Include COMPLETE, RESPONSIBLE, and REVIEW directives at the bottom. 
   * [[ExampleMainTopic]] for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * [[ExampleTopicInclude]] for a topic likely to included in other topics, so =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= and =EDITTHIS= directives are used.
   * [[ExampleCompositeDocument]] what a composite document of includes should look like.
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Avoid nested INCLUDES.
   * Here is the WebTopicEditTemplate for newly created pages in this twiki, which are assumed to be included in other topics.

---++ Variables
See WebPreferences for settings of the following variables.

   * OSG release variable: *%<nop>OSG_VERSION%* = %OSG_VERSION%
   * ITB release variable: *%<nop>ITB_VERSION%* = %ITB_VERSION%
   * VDT release variable: *%<nop>VDT_VERSION%* = %VDT_VERSION%
   * Release variable, according to cache (ITB or OSG): *%<nop>VERSION%* = %VERSION%
   * VDT cache variable: *%<nop>VDT_CACHE%* = %VDT_CACHE%
   * ITB/OSG cache/grid variable: *%<nop>CACHE%* = %CACHE%
      * Use the  *%<nop>CACHE%* variable as a generic reference for either "ITB" or "OSG" *caches*, *grids*, etc.  It automatically expands to "ITB" if its in the Integration web, or to "OSG" if its in the production release documentation web.
   * Refer to the cache/version combination that you're using, e.g, %CACHE% %VERSION%, with a space in between, as %BR% %BLUE% %<nop>CACHE% %<nop>VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%
   * Full URL to base of VDT Documentation for current release *%<nop>VDT_DOCS_URL%*: %VDT_DOCS_URL%
   * Full URL to VDT Cache for this release: *%<nop>VDT_CACHE_URL%*: %VDT_CACHE_URL%
   * Full URL to OSG Cache (ITB or Production) for this release *%<nop>OSG_CACHE_URL%*: %OSG_CACHE_URL%
   * Pacman version: *%<nop>PACMAN_VERSION%*: %PACMAN_VERSION%

---++ Reviewing tools
   * The variable *%<nop>COMPLETEn%* where *n* is 1 to 3 is used to indicate how complete the topic is.
      * %COMPLETE1% - getting started
      * %COMPLETE2% - halfway or more
      * %COMPLETE3% - finished
   * At the bottom, signatures should be inserted each time there is a significant change. 
   * The responsible person should be indicated by *%<nop>RESPONSIBLE% !Main.WhoEver*. 
   * The last time the topic was reviewed should be indicated by *%<nop>REVIEW% !Main.WhoEver - Date*
   * Thus, at the bottom of each page, include:
<verbatim>
   %BR%
   %COMPLETEn% %BR%
   %RESPONSIBLE% Main.ResponsibleTwikiUser %BR%
   %REVIEW% Main.ReviewerTwikiUser - dd Oct 2007
</verbatim>
   * The results are in ReviewStatus.

---++ Indexing
A command for inserting twiki Topics into an index is available, and recommended.  The syntax is:
<verbatim>
    #SomeTwikiTopic<index entry="Descriptive subject string for topic, to be included in the release index"/>
</verbatim>
You can also use:
<verbatim>
    #%TOPIC%<index entry="Descriptive subject string for topic, to be included in the release index"/>
</verbatim>
Such topics will appear in the Trash.ReleaseDocumentationReleaseIndex.

---++ !WebLeftBar
The WebLeftBar is used primarily contain the high-level table of contents for the release documentation.  Presently it must be edited by hand.

---++ Printed documentation
Generating PDF documents recursively: *need to understand how to do this efficiently.*
