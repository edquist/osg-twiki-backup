---++ RSV background

<p> The [[MonitoringInformation.RSV][OSG-RSV]] package, by default, is installed along with the OSG CE but not fully configured. Additional configuration steps are necessary as documented below. 

<p> Starting with %CACHE% %VERSION% CE, unless =VDTSETUP_NO_CONDOR_CRON= is set to =1=, RSV will always include a minimal Condor package called condor-cron that is used to schedule RSV probes and such.

<!-- If you are looking to install !RSV on a monitoring host independent of your CE then please [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/vdt-package.html#install_on_monitoring_host][look here]] for instructions on that. -->

---+++ Quick request to <u> VTB/ITB admins who use GUMS</u> :-) 
<p style="background-color=#111111;"> <strong><em> If you use GUMS, and would be willing to test an updated GUMS probe</em></strong>; and you got your stuff from the VDT 1.10.0a cache, then please get updated probes after getting the CE or !OSG-RSV package [only till VDT 1.10.0b or 1.10.1 is released]:
   <pre class="screen"> cd $VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/probes
 rm -f gums-authorization-validator-probe OSG_RSV_Probe_Base.pm
 wget http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/downloads/pre-release/0.9.0/OSG_RSV_Probes_2.2.3-patch.tar.gz
 tar -zxvf OSG_RSV_Probes_2.2.3-patch.tar.gz
 chmod -R go+rX $VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/probes/ </pre>

<p> Thanks for your patience!

---+++ Should I use a service certificate or a user certificate?
<p> If you run !RSV right on a CE (SE), and only monitor that CE (SE), then you can use a service certificate to run RSV probes. The important factor is that the <em> service certificate or its proxy, per its policy and the OSG security group's mandate, should not leave the host it was generated for, and can only be used to test that one host</em>, i.e. one of { <tt>--ce-uri</tt> or <tt>--gridftp-uri</tt> or <tt>--srm-uri</tt>or <tt>--gums-uri</tt>} should be pointed to only the one host for which the service cert was issued for. 
<p> If you want to use a service certificate for !RSV,  then:
   * You must get one using [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Other_service_certificates][usual methods]]. For example: 
   <pre class="screen">cert-request -ou s -service rsv -host <strong><em>FQDN</em></strong> -label rsv-<strong><em>fqdn</em></strong> </pre>
   * You must ensure that  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/MapServiceCertToRsvuser][service cert is authorized to run jobs on the CE/SE ]] it is being used to test.
   * Place !RSV service cert files in =/etc/grid-security/= as <tt>rsvkey.pem</tt> and <tt>rsvcert.pem</tt>, or use command line switches to point to those files as shown below in =[ ]=

---+++Configuring !RSV within !OSG wide config.ini (and configure_osg.py)
<p> The recommended and simplest way to configure !RSV on an !OSG CE is by editing the =[RSV]= section in =config.ini=. The section is self-explanatory -- each option is commented upon in detail. Or you can also refer to the [[ConfigurationFileHelp#Introduction_to_RSV_Section][RSV section of the ConfigureFileHelp]] twiki page.

<pre class="programlisting">[RSV]
 . . . 
enabled = True
 . . . 
rsv-user = rsvuser
 . . . </pre>

<p> If you'd rather do the !RSV configuration on the command line using =configure_osg_rsv=, then refer to the [[MonitoringInformation/InstallAndConfigureRsvAdvanced][advanced !RSV configuration twiki page]].


---++ Start RSV and related services
<p> Start Condor-cron and !RSV services (plus [re]start Apache, if you want the VDT Apache to serve your local status pages, and specified the <tt>--setup-for-apache</tt> switch above).  

<p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> If the services (for e.g., Apache) have already been started as a result of previous CE configuration steps, etc., then you should stop them and restart them again.

  <pre class="screen"> ## Assuming you used --server 'y' above, these services should be enabled, but if they are not, then enable them
 ## vdt-control --enable condor-cron osg-rsv apache
 ## If apache is already turned on, then do vdt-control --off apache
 vdt-control --on condor-cron osg-rsv apache </pre>

<!--      More information on this  is [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/vdt-1.8.1a-package.html#start_rsv][available here]]. -->

---++ Validating !RSV configuration
   * <p><strong>Condor_cron jobs:</strong> You can check all the condor-cron RSV jobs that got submitted typing <tt>condor_cron_q</tt>.
   * <p><strong>Local !RSV status page :</strong> After waiting about 15 minutes, check out the local status web page that is created with results of RSV probe runs each day. By default, this page is =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/output/html/index.html=, but can be reconfigured. You can either view the local status pages directly on the monitoring host ; or you can view these pages on the web at !https://&#60;FQDN_of_monitoring_host&#62;:8443/rsv, once again assuming you configured !RSV to use the !VDT Apache using the =--setup-for-apache= switch during config time. Beware that you <em>need to have an !OSG approved cert loaded in your web browser</em> to be able to view them page. The status pages should look similar to [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/sample_status.html][what is documented here]].

   * <p><strong>RSV output record upload to central collector (using Gratia transport):</strong> Look at Gratia consumer log file: =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/logs/consumers/gratia-script-consumer.out= to see if probe results were uploaded successfully to the !GOC maintained !RSV database. You should a bunch of entries similar to this:
   <pre class="programlisting">   08-20-2007 16:35:26 - Executing script '/usr/local/grid/ . . . record.py'
   OK </pre> You can also email the !GOC to check if the records got through. We'll have a page to go check on this !RSN.

<!--   * Configure Metrics to run and how often: If this is the first time you're configuring !RSV, then copy the sample metrics file =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/config/sample_metrics.conf= to =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/config/&#60;host_FQDN&#62;_metrics.conf=, and make further edits to it if necessary. The sample file has the metrics listed with appropriate (recommended) time intervals. Enable/Disable a particular metric: Any line that starts with *on* is enabled; change that keyword to *off* to disable a metric. For example, if you site runs only the PBS job-manager, then you might disable the other jobmanagers-status probes.
   <pre class="programlisting">   on jobmanagers-status-probe@org.osg.batch.jobmanager-pbs-status 24 */2 * * *</pre>
   More information on this is [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/vdt-1.8.1a-package.html#configure_metrics][available here]]. Go here for documenation on [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/vdt-1.8.1a-package.html#extra_probe_specs][adding custom switches to the !RSV !probes]].
