---++ How to preserve configuration
If you are doing a major update (from one VDT version to another, but not a minor update, such as VDT %VDT_VERSION%a to VDT %VDT_VERSION%b), you can automatically preserve some of your configuration.

The basic process for the installation is the same as it is documented elsewhere. However, if you do the installation on the same computer as the old installation, much of the configuration can be preserved and updated for the new installation. 

The VDT web page [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced.html#preserve_config][documents how to do this in detail]]. The basic procedure is that you define an environment variable to point at the old installation before you do the installation, and the VDT installation process will copy some of the configuration from the old installation.
