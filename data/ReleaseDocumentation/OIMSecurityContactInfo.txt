---++ Maintenance of Contact Info in OIM
You can update your contact information in the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Information Management (OIM)]] system by clicking the Profile link at the top.  However, you will need a [[Documentation.CertificateGet][personal X.509 certificate]] in your web browser in order to register with OIM and for access to update your information.  OSG will do a periodic assessment of the contact information (twice a year) to encourage users to keep their information up-to-date.  But it is expected that people will keep their own information current.

Please also update OIM and notify the GOC whenever the operations or security contacts for your site changes.

%RED%NOTE:%ENDCOLOR% Maintaining valid contact information is 50% of being a GREAT site admin! Seriously. We will send you security patches, updates, instructions for risk mitigation, and so on. Without valid contact information, you are out in the cold. Also, if you become unresponsive to all of our connection attempts, we will start thinking you left OSG.
