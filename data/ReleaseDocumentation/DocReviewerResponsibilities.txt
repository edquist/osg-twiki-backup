The reviewer of a document should have knowledge about standards and format for the type of document being reviewed and is responsible for:
   1. Performing a review (when the Owner says the page is ready for review) and correcting or noting issues for the Owner.  The review should verify the document:
      A. Contains the relevant sections specified in the template for the relevant document type
      A. Sections and content conform to the formatting standards for the relevant document type (e.g. see DocFormattingRules)
      A. Is clearly written and can be understood by a reader with varying levels of expertise
      A. Has or refers to a diagram of the appropriate architecture (if applicable)
      A. Is technically accurate and complete (you are not responsible for actually testing a procedure)
      A. Contains no typos or errors 
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner to ensure the issues you identify are resolved in the document
   1. Doing a final review when you, the Tester, and the Owner agree it is complete
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Reviewer
