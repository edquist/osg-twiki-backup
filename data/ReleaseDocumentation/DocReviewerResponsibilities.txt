      A. Sections and content conform to the formatting standards for the relevant document type (e.g. see ReleaseDocumentation.FormattingRules)
      A. Is clearly written and can be understood by a reader with varying levels of expertise
      A. Has or refers to a diagram of the appropriate architecture (if applicable)
      A. Is technically accurate and complete (you are not responsible for actually testing a procedure)
      A. Contains no typos or errors 
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner to ensure the issues you identify are resolved in the document
   1. Doing a final review when you, the Tester, and the Owner agree it is complete
