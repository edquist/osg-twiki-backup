---++ Introduction to CE installation

Now you're ready to start installing the Compute Element (CE) services. We distinguish between software that must be installed on the CE head node and software which must be executable from the worker nodes. Note:
   * If you've just installed the workernode client on your CE, log out and log back in again so that your PATH doesn't become confused. 
   * This section addresses the software executed on the CE (server/gatekeeper node). 

---++ Shutdown existing installations
 If you have an existing CE installed and running, you *must* do a complete shutdown and confirm that all processes associated with it have been stopped. Refer to [[ShuttingDownCE][Shutting Down]] for details.

%IMPORTANT% Remember you are not shutting down this version, so choose the correct link in that section for the specific version you are replacing. Be sure all services and crons are disabled. Technically it is only necessary to shut down the old installation once the new software has been installed but before it is activated.

---++ Create an installation directory
 Create a directory such as =/opt/osg-%VERSION%= and create a sym link =/opt/osg= that points to this directory. Please *do not* install in a directory like /opt or /usr, because the installation will create a slew of subdirectories. 
   * Finally, make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 

---++ Install the compute element
 The installation described here is done as root even though services will not necessarily run as root: 
   * A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed. %BR% Please answer *y* (yes) so that the software can be retrieved. 

The following pacman command will install the package:

=# pacman -get %CACHE%:ce=

See the [[PacmanBestPractices][Pacman section]] of this guide if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message.

%NOTE% This will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending upon the system and network connection. During this time you may open a second terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log= file.

You should not be asked any other questions during the installation process. The installation should complete with the following message:
<pre>Downloading [vo-package-6.tar.gz] from [http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs]...  
Untarring [vo-package-6.tar.gz]...  
Existing /usr/local/vdt-1.10.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf moved to /usr/local/vdt-1.10.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf.orig 
Merge it manually with the new /usr/local/vdt-1.10.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.confif you had a special edg-mkgridmap.conf <p>Pacman Installation of OSG-%VERSION% Complete </p></pre>
%STARTOSG12% 
In the latest release the install completes with the following message:
<pre>
All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
Your CA certificates have been setup automatically using information from
OLD_VDT_LOCATION.  Verify the link at VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA
                                                                              
Pacman Installation of OSG-1.1.1 Complete
 
</pre>
%ENDOSG12%


---++ Setup the OSG environment

Assuming the Pacman install completed without errors, you should now be able to source the OSG environment. Change your directory to the location where you installed the OSG CE software. From here forward this directory is known as the _$VDT_LOCATION_ and that variable will be set when you source the setup script:

=# cd  &#60; Your OSG CE Location &#62;=  

=# source setup.sh= <BR>
or <BR>
=# source setup.csh=

If the Pacman install had errors, the setup.sh or setup.csh files will probably not be there and there will be errors on the screen with more explanation in the vdt-install.log.

---++ Install job managers

You need to install an extra package to interface with your existing Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE installation. Before proceeding, please consider:

%NOTE% For the Globus-PBS-Setup package, make sure your PBS binaries (qsub, qstat, qdel) are in the $PATH prior to installation. The install will fail silently with error reported to =vdt-install.log= and jobmanager-pbs will not be created. If this is done, do a =<userinput>pacman -remove %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup</userinput>=, insert the binaries into your PATH and install again.

%NOTE% For Globus-Condor-Setup, if you want to use a pre-existing Condor installation, be sure the following variables are set appropriately, otherwise the VDT will bring down a full installation of all the condor binaries: To specify an external Condor installation set the following two environment variables before installing:
   * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION==: the location of your Condor installation (e.g. =/opt/condor=). The Condor =bin/=, =sbin/=, =etc/=, =lib/= ... directories should be directly under this location. 
   * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG==: _(optional)_ The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is =${VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION}/etc/condor_config= 

Now, *%BLUE% ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path,%ENDCOLOR%* and then install the appropriate package in your =$VDT_LOCATION= directory (for Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE respectively). To install, run the appropriate command in the following list:

<pre># pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-Condor-Setup 
# pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup
# pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-LSF-Setup  
# pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-SGE-Setup </pre>

Any of the packages Globus-XXX-Setup will include web-services (Globus-WS-XXX-Setup) and Gratia probes. This guide will not go into the detail on the installation of any of these packages.

%NOTE%  Globus-Condor-Setup *only* - The $VDT_LOCATION/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/condor.pm will by default insert a requirement that all jobs run on nodes of the same architecture as the gatekeeper. i.e. if your gatekeeper is x86_64 architecture, your jobs will only run there. If your gatekeeper is x86 (i686 "INTEL"), your jobs would only run there. You have to comment out the line in condor.pm that looks like this to override this feature:
<pre>#    $requirements .= " && Arch == \"" . $description->condor_arch() . "\" "; </pre>

%STARTOSG12% You will need to run =source setup.sh; vdt-post-install= after you've completed installing components using pacman before you continue. 
%ENDOSG12%

---++ Post install README
 Read the =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= file. We suggest that you read the file for information only, and follow the instructions in the various OSG installation guides presented in these pages, rather than those in the VDT README file.
