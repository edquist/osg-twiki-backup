%ICON{wip}% Work in Progress

This page documents security practices recommended by the OSG Security Team.


---++ Communicate with Security team
   * *Notify security team of any incidents*.
      * This is the primary requirement OSG security team places on the site admin.
      * Procedure to report security incidents is identified [[Security.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][here]]
   * We ask for reporting incidents so that we can
      * Access the risk it poses to OSG at large
      * Notice any patterns in the attacks
      * Contain the spread of the incident/attack
   * Communication during incident is critical
      * Emails from/to the security team should be signed
      * Take actions advised by security team promptly
      * Need to send encrypted data. Instructions [[Security.SecureEmail][here]]
   * We work with you to keep your security incident information you send us confidential
      * We release to OSG site/VO security contacts only as much information as necessary to maintain security
   * Know your local institutions cyber-security contacts and report incidents to then in addition to OSG security team.
   * When you are questions *ASK*
      * Questions could be on general UNIX security in general or specific Grid security topics. 
      * You may have questions about specific OSG polices and procedures.
      * OSG security team and/or your fellow OSG site administrators will more often than not be able to help address your questions.
      * *PLEASE ASK*. osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org.

---++ Incident Handling

Promptly report security incidents involving OSG resources according to 
[[Security.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][these instructions]].

   * [[BanningUsersAtSite][Banning User DNs at your site]]
   * [[BasicForensics][Basic Forensics Techniques]]
---++ Monitoring

Monitor for suspicious activity such as 
   * connection attempts from suspicious IP addresses
   * instances of suspicious ssh keys, files, and malware 

Recommended monitoring tools:
   * [[http://www.logwatch.org/][Logwatch]]: A customizable log analysis system.
   * [[http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/][Samhain]]: A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).
   * [[http://www.bro-ids.org/][Bro]]: A network intrusion detection system (NIDS).
   * [[http://www.chkrootkit.org/][chkrootkit]]: A tool to locally check for signs of a rootkit.

---++ Logging

Log system activity and use logs to troubleshoot problems and investigate security incidents.

Resources:
   * [[Security.LogFiles4Services][Log Files for OSG Services]]

---++ System Updates

Promptly apply security updates from software vendors, including operating system kernel updates and VDT updates.

Resources:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.UpdateInstructions][Update between minor OSG revisions]]
      * Updating between minor OSG releases has been drastically improved
      * Please promptly install the latest OSG update.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.VdtUpdateGuide][VDT Update Guide]]
   * [[https://www.redhat.com/rhn/][Red Hat Network]]: Automates updates for Red Hat Linux systems.

---++ Firewalls

Use firewalls to restrict access to system services:
   * Allow ssh connections (port 22) only from trusted hosts. See [[Security.SshHostsAllow]] for documentation on how to restrict access using =/etc/hosts.allow= and =/etc/hosts.deny=.

Resources:
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/firewall.html][VDT and Firewalls]]
   * [[http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/][iptables]]: The command-line program for configuring the Linux firewall.

---++ SSH Keys

Protect SSH private keys with passphrases.

Don't share keys.

[[BestPractices:MonitoringSSHActivity][Simple ways to monitor your systems for SSH activity]]

---++ Account Passwords

Use different passwords for different accounts. Always use good passwords.

---++ Hands-on Training
   *  [[SecurityHandsOnTraining][Security Training]] (from OSG All Hands Meeting, Baron Rouge, LA, Mar 2, 2009)

---++ Risks for Grid Sites
   * [[SecurityRisksCE][Security Risks of Grid Resources]]
---++ Reference Materials
