This page documents security practices recommended by the OSG Security Team.


---++ Risks for Grid Sites

When sites become members of the OSG (or any other grid community) there may be additional risks to the local resources associated with grid computing.  We try and outline some of these potential risks on the following page.

   * [[SecurityRisksCE][Security Risks of Grid Resources]]

---++ Communicate with Security team
   * *Notify security team of any incidents*.
      * This is the primary requirement the OSG security team places on the site admin.
      * Procedures to report security incidents are identified [[Security.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][here]]
   * We ask users and sites to report incidents so that we can
      * Access the risk it poses to the OSG at large
      * Notice any patterns in the attacks
      * Notify sites with attack information
      * Contain the spread of the incident/attack
   * Communication during incident is critical
      * Emails from/to the security team should be signed
      * Take actions advised by security team promptly
      * Need to send encrypted data. Instructions [[Security.SecureEmail][here]]
   * We work with you to keep your security incident information you send us confidential
      * We release to OSG site/VO security contacts only as much information as necessary to maintain security
   * Know your local institutions cyber-security contacts and report incidents to then in addition to OSG security team.
   * When you have questions *ASK*
      * Questions could be on general UNIX security in general or specific Grid security topics. 
      * You may have questions about specific OSG polices and procedures.
      * OSG security team and/or your fellow OSG site administrators will more often than not be able to help address your questions.
      * *PLEASE, JUST ASK*. osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org.

---++ Incident Handling

Promptly report security incidents involving OSG resources according to 
[[Security.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][these instructions]].

Resources:
   * [[BanningUsersAtSite][Banning User DNs at your site]]
   * [[BasicForensics][Basic Forensics Techniques]]
---++ Monitoring

Monitor for suspicious activity such as 
   * connection attempts from suspicious IP addresses
   * instances of suspicious ssh keys, files, and malware 

Recommended monitoring tools:
   * [[http://www.logwatch.org/][Logwatch]]: A customizable log analysis system.
   * [[http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/][Samhain]]: A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).
   * [[http://www.bro-ids.org/][Bro]]: A network intrusion detection system (NIDS).
   * [[http://www.chkrootkit.org/][chkrootkit]]: A tool to locally check for signs of a rootkit.

---++ Logging

Log system activity and use logs to troubleshoot problems and investigate security incidents.

Resources:
   * [[Security.LogFiles4Services][Log Files for OSG Services]]

---++ System Updates

Promptly apply security updates from software vendors, including operating system kernel updates and VDT updates.

Resources:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.UpdateInstructions][Update between minor OSG revisions]]
      * Updating between minor OSG releases has been drastically improved
      * Please promptly install the latest OSG update.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.VdtUpdateGuide][VDT Update Guide]]
   * [[https://www.redhat.com/rhn/][Red Hat Network]]: Automates updates for Red Hat Linux systems.

---++ Firewalls

Use firewalls to restrict access to system services:
   * Allow ssh connections (port 22) only from trusted hosts. See [[Security.SshHostsAllow]] for documentation on how to restrict access using =/etc/hosts.allow= and =/etc/hosts.deny=.

Resources:
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/firewall.html][VDT and Firewalls]]
   * [[http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/][iptables]]: The command-line program for configuring the Linux firewall.

---++ SSH Keys

Protect SSH private keys with passphrases.

Don't share keys.

[[BestPractices:MonitoringSSHActivity][Simple ways to monitor your systems for SSH activity]]

---++ Account Passwords

Use different passwords for different accounts. Always use good passwords.

---++ Hands-on Training
   *  [[SecurityHandsOnTraining][Security Training]] (from OSG All Hands Meeting, Baron Rouge, LA, Mar 2, 2009)
