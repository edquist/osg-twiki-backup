%TOC%

The OSG Certificate Authority Distribution contains configuration information for Certificate Authorities (CAs) in use in OSG for vdt-update-certs.

---+++ News

Beginning in  May , 2010 OSG has started to provide a CA distribution for the integration test bed (ITB) separate
from the production OSG distribution described below. Information about the ITB release is provided at http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/.<br/>
%RED%<b>NOTE:</b> Production services on OSG should *NOT* install (or reference via yum or apt) the ITB
version of the CA distribution since it may, at times, contain an untrustworthy CA certificate for testing purposes!%ENDCOLOR%

Effective March 10, 2009, the OSG Security Team has removed the following unused non-IGTF CAs from the
OSG CA distribution:

   * PSC Kerberos CA (290a3b29)
   * PSC Root CA (9b88e95b)
   * PSC Hosts CA (acc06fda)
   * SDSC (3deda549)
   * NPACI (b89793e4)
   * TACC (9a1da9f9)
   * old NCSA CA (4a6cd8b1)

If you are aware of any use of these CAs in OSG, so that they should
continue to be included in the OSG CA distribution, please notify
security@opensciencegrid.org immediately.

---+++ Know your responsibilities
There are now two locations from which CA certificates can be downloaded by the vdt-update-certs package (CA-Certificates-Updater):
one with only the IGTF accredited CAs maintained by the VDT team and the other *primary* distribution of *OSG recommended*
CA certificates maintained by the OSG security team, shown in the configuration description below.
The vdt-update-certs package now has a configuration file you must edit to specify which location is used to
download the set of available CA certificates.

In addition, the vdt-update-certs package can be configured to include or exclude CAs
from the trusted CA installation directory.
See http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/man/vdt-update-certs.html for additional information on these
capabilities of vdt-update-certs.

---++ Configuration

To configure vdt-update-certs to use the OSG CA Distribution, set the =cacerts_url= value in =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf= as follows:

<verbatim>
cacerts_url=http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version
</verbatim>

---++ Check your version
To check the version installed on your service/site do
<verbatim>
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
head -20 $X509_CADIR/CHANGES
</verbatim>
and the top of the CHANGES file will show which version you have installed.
If it is not the latest one on the [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/][distribution site]] then you probably do not have automatic updates
running so you should read the instructions above about running vdt-update-certs.
