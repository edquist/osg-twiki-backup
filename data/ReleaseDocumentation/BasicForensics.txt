---+ *Basic Forensics*
%TOC{depth="2"}%

Here are some basic steps one can take when investigating an incident on a machine used in the OSG.  These are by no means comprehensive in everything that should be looked into.  But they can give a good indication if there is a problem, and also what additional steps may need to be taken.

---++ Inspect Batch System
---+++ Where did the job run?
   * Fork jobmanager or batch system
   * If batch system, which node
   * For Condor 
<pre class="screen">
      condor_q -l job_id
      condor_q –l userid
</pre>
   * For PBS
<pre class="screen">
      qstat -f job_identifier=
</pre>
   * Review your batch system logs

---++ Locate User Processes
   * What processes are running for a user?
<pre class="screen">
      ps -u mis -U mis uwww
</pre>
   * Remember to locate processes on both Computing Element (CE) and Worker Node (WN)

---++Does the Job have any Open Files or Ports?
   * Use lsof and/or netstat
<pre class="screen">
      lsof -u mis -P
      netstat -ap
</pre>
   * Did you find them?
      * An open hidden file (check /tmp and other world writable directories)
      * An open TCP connection
   * If the process running is a script - review the script code and try to identify what it is trying to do
   * If the executable is a binary file
      * Use strings command
      * Look for hostnames, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and other clues

---++ Killing Suspicious User Jobs 
   * Remove job from batch system
<pre class="screen">
      condor_rm cluster_id (for Condor)
      qdel job_id (for PBS)
</pre>
   * Kill any lingering processes associated with the suspicious user
<pre class="screen">
       kill -9 process_id
       killall process_name
</pre>
   * Make sure all the suspicious user processes have been terminated

---++ What Ifs
   * All DNs from the VO are getting mapped to the same user DN.
      * Killing all the user process on the CE
         * Kills Condor-G grid-manager and Globus jobmanager processes of other users in the VO
         * VO should be able to recover from these failures
      * Selective killing of jobs associated with user DN
         * Possible by looking at logfiles, process timestamps
         * Will be tedious
         * Decision at the discretion of the sites
         * VOs will appreciate it 
   * User process is aggressively forking?
      * After killing suspicious processes, check for new processes using ps
      * Node shutdown/reboot may be required
      * *Beware of lingering effects (example: cron, at)*
  
---++ Handling Escalations
   * Investigate the incident
      * Follow your home organization’s security procedures and policies
      * Determine if there were any compromises arising from the incident
   * If you suspect that any other user accounts, certificates, proxies have been compromised due to this incident immediately follow the [[IncidentDiscoveryReporting][incident reporting instructions]].
   * Any other policies/procedures for sites to follow? 
   * If the attacker succeeded in escalating the privileges by installing rootkits, the simple forensic techniques we have discussed here will be insufficient. 
      * Once an attacker has root access we can no longer rely on the commands we run on the node.
      * Run host and network based rootkit detector tools.
      * Review network traffic flows.
      * It would be advisable to remove the machine from the network, analyze the compromise, and wipe the machine clean.
      * Detailed discussion on topics regarding root level compromise is outside the scope of this page.
