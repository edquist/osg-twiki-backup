---++ Introduction to Local Settings Section

This section gives information about the Local Settings section.  

---++ Options

This section differs from other sections in that there are no set options in this section.  Rather, the options set in this section will be placed in the =osg-local-job-environment.conf= verbatim.  The options in this section are case sensitive and the case will be preserved when they are converted to environment variables.  

For example adding a line such as =My_Setting = my_Value= would result in the an environment variable called =My_Setting= set to =my_Value= being set in the environment when =osg-local-job-environment.conf= is sourced.  For example, to add a variable =MY_PATH= set to =/usr/local/myapp=, you'd have the following:
<pre class="screen">
[Local Settings]

MY_PATH = /usr/local/myapp
</pre>
