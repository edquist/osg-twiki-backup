---++ Introduction

Background information for host, service and grid user certificates can be found [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][here]].  Here we discuss obtaining host certificates and private keys that are needed for a compute element.  You will also need an http certificate for CEMon and anything else that runs under Apache/Tomcat.  If you are need a personal certificate rather than a host or service certificate see UserCertificate.

%NOTE% For security reasons, please *do not* use clones of your host certificate for additional certificates even though it's technically possible.  There is one exception to this.  If you enable Globus web services, the Globus container requires  the host certificate.  Since the Globus container runs as _non_root_, the VDT configuration software will clone your host certificate as =/etc/grid-security/containercert.pem(containerkey.pem)= and will be owned by the account you configured Globus to run under (normally _globus_ or _daemon_). This is the *ONLY* exception at this time.

%NOTE% If you find the http certificate files already installed, you might want to check their end date which indicates their validity. As root, run the =openssl= command on each of the =*cert.pem= files, e.g.,:
<pre class="screen">
    # openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -enddate -noout
</pre>

---++ Certificate scripts package

The [[CertScripts][Certificate Scripts Package]] provides scripts to request and retrieve certificates (see also [[Security.CertScriptsPackage][PPDG-Cert-Scripts]]).  Any recent OSG or VDT installation has them.  You can install the package stand-alone if that is convenient.

   * Note: It possible to request host certificates for any host using a VDT/OSG install on any other computer.
  
*Installation of the cert-scripts package:* Make the directory where you are going to install the package, and =cd= to it.  Note that this will be the =$VDT_LOCATION=
for this temporarily installation of the certificate scripts.  The installation can be done as a regular user or as root. Find the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html][latest VDT cache]], and download =PPDG-Cert-Scripts= from it (shown for VDT %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%), and answer the installation questions as shown below:

<pre class="screen">
# <b>mkdir tmp-cert-scripts</b>
# <b> cd tmp-cert-scripts</b>
# <b>pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/%VDT_CACHE%:PPDG-Cert-Scripts</b>
Do you want to add [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/%VDT_CACHE%] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>
Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] <b>y</b>
Where would you like to install CA files?
Choices:
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b>n</b>
</pre>
Then, to set up your environment to use the scripts:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>source ./setup.sh</b> ### for csh/tcsh use setup.csh
</pre>

It is important to answer =<b>No</b>= to the question about CA files since they are not needed
to use the =cert-request= and =cert-retrieve= scripts and installing them here will likely
cause confusion since they should normally be installed with the CE package.

After you have completed installation of the CE or Client packages it is probably useful to
remove this temporary certificate scripts installation to avoid confusion with the
scripts included with the CE and Client packages.

---++ Request a host certificate

Every resource or service running on the grid needs an X509 identity certificate from one of the trusted CAs. 
   * Currently the [[http://www.doegrids.org][DOEGrids CA]] is the most common CA in use for OSG participants. 
   * The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra][OSG Registration Authority]] with DOEGrids handles most certificate requests for OSG participants. 
 
%NOTE% Do not use a host's DNS alias when requesting a host certificate. Use the authoritative DNS name. Failing to do so can cause GSS authentication failures similar to the following when a user tries to authenticate to the host after your certificate is installed:

<pre>
GSS authentication failure 
GSS Major Status: General failure 
GSS Minor Status Error Chain: 
accept_sec_context.c:gss_accept_sec_context:403: 
Error during delegation: Delegation protocol violation 
Failure: GSS failed Major:000d0000 Minor:00000001 Token:00000000 
</pre>

Run the =cert-request= script  to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.
$VDT_LOCATION must point to the package in which the scripts exist, e.g., the CE install directory or where you installed PPDG-Cert-Scripts,
or the temporary directory as described above.  The values for the =-label= and =-dir= options need to match the values used later with the =cert-retrieve= script.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source  ./setup.sh</b>
# <b>cd vdt/setup/</b>   ### you could use some other directory, such as /etc/grid-security
#                 ### which is the typical location to install the certificates
# <b>cert-request -ou s -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>

        You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate

        certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</pre>

The certificate request will leave some files in the directory that will be needed when you retrieve your cert.

%NOTE% It is possible to continue with steps in the install procedure while you are waiting for your host certificate to be approved.

See [[Security.CSReadMe#cert_request][full man page]] on the cert-request command for additional useful options.

---++ Retrieve and install the host certificate

After the certificate is approved you will receive an email which includes the serial number (shown as =0xYYYY= below) of the new certificate. Use that serial number to retrieve the certificate as shown below.  

From the installation directory (where you ran =cert-request=), run =cert-retrieve=.  Again, use the same values for =-label= and =-dir= used for the request.  
<pre class="screen">
# <b>cert-retrieve  -serial <i>0xYYYY</i> -label <i>my-host</i> -dir . -prefix <i>host</i></b>

</pre>
<i>Note that if you did not use the =-prefix= option to name the =.pem= files
they will have the default values of =usercert.pem= and =userkey.pem=.</i>

Now move the =hostcert.pem= and =hostkey.pem= files to =/etc/grid-security= and set permissions:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>mv ./hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/</b>
# <b>mv ./hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/</b>
# <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
# <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
</pre>


The following command will verify the certificate is readable.  The output shown will be similar, but specific to your request.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>

      Subject: DC=org, DC=doegrids, OU=Services, CN=my-host.some.domain
      .........
</pre>


---++ Other service certificates 

Additional service certificate can be obtained using the same procedure as for the host certificate above by
simply including the =-service servicename= option with cert-request.  For =servicename= you might use =http=.  
The name of the service is rather arbitrary.
<pre class="screen">
> cert-request -ou s -service http -host my-computer.some.domain -label http-my-computer
</pre>

Get an HTTP service certificate to activate CEMon

%BLUE%[D.O. - Seems to me that the CEMon install/configure documentation should describe what certificate
it needs rather than putting that here.%ENDCOLOR%

See the [[CEMonOnComputeElement][CEMon section]] for the details on activating this service.  You will need the http certificate available before you activate this service.  <i>CEMon</i> runs as a  <i>tomcat</i> service and therefore the HTTP certicate must be owned by the uid under which tomcat and apache run.   (If you installed as <i>root</i>, the default user  for tomcat/apache is <i>daemon</i>).

<pre class="screen">
&gt;  <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt;  <b>cert-request -ou s</b> 
                -dir . \
                -host <i>my-host.some.domain</i> \
                -service http \
                -label <i>my-host-http</i>
</pre>
And after receiving an email notice that the certificate was issued, retrieve it as

<pre class="screen">
> <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
> <b>cert-retrieve -serial 0xNNNN -label <i>my-host-http</i> -prefix http -dir .</b>
</pre>

Follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating =httpkey.pem= and =httpcert.pem=.  This certificate should be should be located in the following directory with ownership and permissions as follows:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir /etc/grid-security/http </b>
$ <b>mv ./httpcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>mv ./httpkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chown -R daemon.daemon /etc/grid-security/http </b>
</pre>
