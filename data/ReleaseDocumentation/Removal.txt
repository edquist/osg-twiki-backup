---+ Security Officer Statement on Removal from OSG

*DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT*

The interconnected nature of OSG requires that all OSG participants share responsibility for security.
The security of each OSG site and VO impacts on the security of other OSG sites and VOs, as well as on partner grids.
The OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Grid Acceptable Use Policy]] and 
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][Service Agreement]]
specify requirements for OSG participants, including security requirements.
Furthermore,
every OSG site and VO must register a security contact in the
[[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Information Management System]]
who will be responsive to requests from the Security Officer.

In the event that a site or VO presents a significant and persistent security threat to the grid,
the OSG Security Officer may recommend to the Executive Board that the site or VO be removed from OSG.
The decisions to remove and to later re-instate the site or VO ultimately rest with the Executive Board.

In the event that a site or VO presents an immediate operational security threat to the grid,
the OSG Security Officer may immediately remove the site or VO from OSG on a temporary basis,
while Executive Board review is pending.

The Security Officer aims to work collaboratively with sites and VOs to maintain the security of OSG.
Removal of a site or VO from OSG for security reasons is an option of last resort.

The Security Officer may initiate removal of a site or VO if one or more of the following criteria are met:
   * The site or VO is repeatedly unresponsive to requests from the Security Officer.
   * The site or VO persistently fails to maintain accurate security contact information in [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OIM]].
   * The site or VO knowingly uses OSG resources for unlawful purposes.
   * The site or VO repeatedly attempts to breach or circumvent OSG administrative or security controls.
   * The site or VO repeatedly fails to report known or suspected security breaches or misuse of resources or credentials to the Security Officer.
   * The site or VO has repeatedly caused security incidents to spread as a result of neglect.
   * The site or VO is unwilling or unable to take reasonable precautions to protect the security of resources and credentials.
   * The site or VO is unwilling or unable to investigate reported security incidents potentially impacting that site or VO.

The Security Officer can be contacted at security@opensciencegrid.org.
