---++ About This Document
This document describes the policy for removing a Virtual Organization (VO) from the OSG.

---++ Policy

Approved by the OSG SecurityTeam Officer (Mine Altunay) on Jun 16 2009.
Approved by the OSG Executive Director (Ruth Pordes) on Jul 15 2009.

The interconnected nature of OSG requires that all OSG participants share responsibility for security. The security of each OSG site and VO impacts on the security of other OSG sites and VOs, as well as on partner grids. The OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Grid Acceptable Use Policy]] and  [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][Service Agreement]] specify requirements for OSG participants, including security requirements. Furthermore, every OSG site and VO must register a security contact in the [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Information Management System]] who will be responsive to requests from the SecurityTeam Officer.

In the event that a site or VO presents an immediate operational security threat to the grid, the OSG SecurityTeam Officer may immediately remove the site or VO from  the OSG operational infrastructure on a temporary basis while awaiting an Executive Board decision.

In the event that a site or VO presents a significant and persistent security threat to the grid, the OSG SecurityTeam Officer may recommend to the Executive Board that the site or VO be removed from the OSG operational infrastructure.  The decisions to remove and to later re-instate the site or VO ultimately rest with the Executive Board.

The SecurityTeam Officer aims to work collaboratively with sites and VOs to maintain the security of OSG. Removal of a site or VO from the OSG operational infrastructure for security reasons is an option of last resort.

The SecurityTeam Officer may initiate removal of a site or VO if one or more of the following criteria are met:
   * The site or VO is repeatedly unresponsive to requests from the SecurityTeam Officer.
   * The site or VO persistently fails to maintain accurate security contact information in [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OIM]].
   * The site or VO repeatedly violates security requirements in the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Grid Acceptable Use Policy]] or the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][Service Agreement]].
   * The site or VO has repeatedly caused security incidents to spread as a result of neglect.

The SecurityTeam Officer can be contacted at security@opensciencegrid.org.

Please see [[Documentation.SecurityTeamBestPractices][SecurityTeam Best Practices]] for security practices recommended by the OSG SecurityTeam Team.

The SecurityTeam Officer will implement this policy according to the [[Documentation.RemovalProcedure][SecurityTeam Procedures for Site/VO Removal]].
