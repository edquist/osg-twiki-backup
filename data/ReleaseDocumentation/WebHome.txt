---++ Introduction
This section covers most topics in site planning.

Start here if you're new to the OSG or have never installed any of our software before 
   * [[DownloadOSG][OSG Software: An Introduction]].  The overall process of putting together an OSG site. 
   * [[OverviewOfServicesInOSG][Overview of OSG services]].  An outline of the different services and implementations the OSG provides.
   * [[SitePlanning][Site Planning]].  How to plan your site; includes what services you might need for different sites
   * [[SiteAdminResources][Resources for site admins]].  Who to contact if you have issues.
If you have a limited amount of time, read the overview of services and the site planning document.  If you plan on installing the CE, move on to "Preparing for installation" below.

A new site admin most likely does not to read the following documents to install the site.  However, this information might be of use to a seasoned admin or to those upgrading.
   * [[WhyUpgrade][Why upgrade?]] 
   * [[OSG12OSG10Differences][Differences between OSG 1.2 and OSG 1.0]]

---++ Compute Element
The CE is the most common grid service provided by the OSG.  This section covers preparation, installation, configuration, and verification of the CE.  A new admin will want to follow the following links approximately in order.
