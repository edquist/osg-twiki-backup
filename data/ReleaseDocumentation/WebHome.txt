---++ Introduction
This section covers most topics in site planning.

Start here if you're new to the OSG or have never installed any of our software before 
   * [[DownloadOSG][OSG Software: An Introduction]].  The overall process of putting together an OSG site. 
   * [[OverviewOfServicesInOSG][Overview of OSG services]].  An outline of the different services and implementations the OSG provides.
   * [[SitePlanning][Site Planning]].  How to plan your site; includes what services you might need for different sites
   * [[SiteAdminResources][Resources for site admins]].  Who to contact if you have issues.
If you have a limited amount of time, read the overview of services and the site planning document.  If you plan on installing the CE, move on to "Preparing for installation" below.

A new site admin most likely does not to read the following documents to install the site.  However, this information might be of use to a seasoned admin or to those upgrading.
   * [[KnownIssues][Known Issues]]

---++ Installation and update tools
An introduction and quick tutorial to the OSG software packaging tools.

The following will be useful to new admins.
   * %LINK_GLOSSARY_PACMAN% 
   * [[PacmanInstall][Installing Pacman]]

   * [[VdtRPMs][VDT software provided as RPMs]] 

The following pages address updating your OSG installations when using Pacman:
   * [[OSG12UpdateInstructions][Updating to new OSG releases]] - This document will help you update to new OSG minor releases.  For example, updating from OSG 1.2.5 to OSG 1.2.6.
   * [[ReusingConfigurationInformation][Reusing OSG configuration information]] - This document will help you reuse configuration when updating to a new OSG major release.  For example, updating from OSG 1.0 to OSG 1.2.

---++ Compute Element
The CE is the most common grid service provided by the OSG.  This section covers preparation, installation, configuration, and verification of the CE.  A new admin will want to follow the following links approximately in order.

   * [[ComputeElementInstall][Installing a compute element]] 
   * [[WorkerNodeClient][Installing worker node client]] 
   * [[ComputeElementPostInstall][Post install configuration]] 
   * [[ValidatingComputeElement][Validating]] 
   * [[StartingServices#Service_Deactivation][Shutting down]]

Run into problems?  Try the [[TroubleshootingComputeElement][CE troubleshooting guide]].

Too little time to read through documentation?  If you are experienced with the install, try the [[QuickInstallGuide][quick-install quide]].
