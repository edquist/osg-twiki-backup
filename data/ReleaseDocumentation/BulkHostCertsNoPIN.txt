This page is to help a discussion of how to improve management of
host certificates.
Diagram below shows possible workflow for managing host certificates in bulk.

   * Each host has software and context to request and download certificates, but not privilege to sign them
   * Cluster admin checks requests and installed serial #&#8217;s for issued certificates
   * Grid Admin verifies DNS scope for requested certificates.
      * Compare digital signature with DNS scope and email address for certificates
   * How much effort is this loop, and how often to do it?
      * Grid Admin stage is ~ 10 min. per bulk request
   * What reports for monitoring?
      * CN duplication
      * Publish ordered lists of valid certificates
         * Order by CN alphabetical, date, email address
      * Require cluster admin to review reports?
      * What frequency? Weekly, Monthly?
   * Does this work for new host installations?  How quickly does initial certificate need to be installed?
