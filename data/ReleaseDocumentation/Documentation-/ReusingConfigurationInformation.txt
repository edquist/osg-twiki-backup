---++ How to reuse configuration information
If you are doing a major update (from one VDT version to another, but not a minor update, such as VDT %VDT_VERSION%a to VDT %VDT_VERSION%b), you can automatically reuse some of the configuration information from the old version in your new installation.

The basic process for the installation is the same as it is documented elsewhere. Note that the old installation must be on the same computer as the new installation you will be doing.

The VDT web page [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced.html#preserve_config][documents how to reuse configuration in detail]]. The basic procedure is that you define an environment variable (=$OLD_VDT_LOCATION=) to point at the old installation before you do the installation, and the VDT installation process will copy some of the configuration from the old installation.
