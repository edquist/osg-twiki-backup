---+ Introduction

The [[http://hep-project-grid-scg.web.cern.ch/hep-project-grid-scg/voms.html][Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS)]] has three main parts: 
   * !MySQL database which is a persistent repository for VO membership information, 
   * VOMS admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VO membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat.
   * VOMS server, a daemon process which services the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests.

Also included in the installation is a VOMS client containing the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> for testing.

Here we describe how to install and configure VOMS on your Linux machine. When you install VOMS as described here, you get all three parts.  It comes with a test VO called VDT. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VO with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.

We also describe how to remove a VO from VOMS if the need arises.
