OSG 0.6.0 (based on VDT 1.6.1) is officially supported on the following platforms:

   | *Operating System* | * Architectures * |
   | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 | x86, x86-64, ia64 |
   | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 | x86, x86-64 |
   | Scientific Linux 3 | x86 |
   | Scientific Linux 4 | x86, x86-64, ia64 |
   | Debian 3.1 | x86 |
   | Fedora Core 3 | x86 |
   | Fedora Core 4 | x86, x86-64 |
   | ROCKS Linux 3.3 | x86 |
   | SUSE Linux 9 | ia64 |

Note that "officially supported" means that the VDT team tests that platform on a nightly basis. It is likely to work on other similar platforms, but they are not tested. 

If you are installing on another platform, you can tell Pacman to pretend that it's one of these supported platforms. For example, if you are installing on a platform similar to !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4, you could do:

=pacman -pretend-platform linux-rhel-4= 

Some common platform names for use with Pacman are:

   | *Pacman Name* | *Platform* | 
   | linux-rhel-3| !RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 |
   | linux-rhel-4 | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 |
   | linux-fedora-3 | Fedora Core 3 |
   | linux-fedora-4 | Fedora Core 4 |
   | linux-debian-3.1 | Debian 3.1 |
   | linux-rocks-3.3 | ROCKS 3.3 |
   | linux-suse-9 | SUSE Linux 9 | 

If you experience problems with the installation of VDT supported software or for general  system requirements, the basic [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/requirements.html][VDT 1.6.1 System requirements page]] may be useful.
