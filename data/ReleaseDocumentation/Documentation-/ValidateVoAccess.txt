---++ Site Validation of VO Access
The purpose of this section is to provide the information necessary to determine if you are configured to support all VOs and users that you intend to support.  

It is __not__ an automated or scripted process.

T he information necessary to perform this validation is described in the [[OsgSupportedVos][Supported VOs and Undefined UNIX Accounts document.]].

After you have run the _edg-mkgridmap_ or _gums-host-cron_ scripts, depending on your authorization mode, and are satisfied with the list of supported VOs and that  the list of undefined UNIX accounts is satisfactory for your site, you can consider this validataion test as complete.
