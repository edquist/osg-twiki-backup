---+ Getting Certificates (Configuring the PKI Infrastructure)
%EDITTHIS%

Read [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateWhatIs]] if you don't know about certificates.

Minimally, you will need a host certificate and private key to identify  your CE.  You may need the following additional certificates if you intend to activate certain optional components:
   * ldap certificate - for publishing the status of your Privilege authorization service (optional)
   * http certificate - for CEMon

%NOTE% For security reasons, please *DO NOT* use clones of your host certificate for these additional certificates even though it's technically possible.  There is one exception to this.  If you enable Globus web services, the Globus container requires  the host certificate.  Since the Globus container runs as _non_root_, the VDT configuration software will clone your host certificate as _/etc/grid-security/containercert.pem(containerkey.pem)_ and will be owned by the account you configured Globus to run under (normally _globus_ or _daemon_). This is the *ONLY* exception at this time.

%NOTE% If you find these certificates already installed, you might want to check their validity. Cd to their directory, as root, run the =openssl= command on each of the =pem= files, e.g.,:
<pre class="screen">
# openssl x509 -in ./hostcert.pem -enddate
</pre>

---++ Install package with certificate scripts
If you're installing the CE, it will give you the scripts you need to request host certificates.  If you prefer, you can get these scripts ahead of time, and go ahead and request your certificates prior to the install. Both ways work.

If you're starting fresh and you're installing something else that doesn't come with these scripts, e.g., VOMS, worker node client, etc., you'll have to install the scripts from the VDT cache.  Find the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html][latest VDT cache]], and download =PPDG-Cert-Scripts= from it (shown for VDT 1.8.0):

%RED%Does it matter where you run this? Should it be under /usr/local/ for instance?%ENDCOLOR%
<pre class="screen">
# pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_180_cache:PPDG-Cert-Scripts
</pre>
As you answer the installation questions, choose =r= to install the CA files in =/etc/grid-security=.

After it finishes, source the setup script. This will set $VDT_LOCATION to your installation directory.

---++ Setup and maintenance of Certificate Authority connection
Configure the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA) to be used by default. To do so, run the utility below.  

If you are given the option of more than one different CA in the  menu below, choose the option which matches DOEGrids, 
then enter =q= at the prompts.  If only DOEGrids is shown, then you can just enter =q= as shown in the output below.

<pre class="screen">

Before you use the Grid Security Infrastructure, you should first
define the DN (distinguished name) that should be used for your
organization's X509 certificates.  If you do not define a DN,
a default DN will be assigned to you.

For some questions, a default response is given in [].
Pressing RETURN in response to such a question will enable the default.
This script will overwrite the file --

     /usr/local/vdt-1.8.0/globus/etc/grid-security.conf

         [ OU=People,DC=doegrids,DC=org ]
(2) Base DN for host certificates

</pre>

During the CE installation/setup, the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.8.0/certificate_authorities.html][VDT's list of CAs]] was added under =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= as the list of authorized CAs on your system.  Also, the variable X509_CERT_DIR was set to $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA. Please review the list of authorized CAs and modify the set in $X509_CERT_DIR as needed to match your local policy.

From OSG 0.5.0/VDT-1.3.11 and greater, the daemon _edg-crl-upgrade_ has been replaced with a root cron job called _fetch-crl_ which runs daily from cron. This will refresh the CRLs from these CAs.  Some of them expire in less than 1 day and you may find it necessary to increase the frequency of the fetch-crl to be more than daily. %RED%I suppose most admins know how to do this, right?%ENDCOLOR%

%IMPORTANT%  *Change from past versions*: The OSG installation is pre-configured as of version 0.6.0 to place the CA certificates in the local =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= directory.  The <i>fetch-crl</i> cron job will be updating CRLs in this local directory only. If you want to maintain certificates in the (old) =/etc/grid-security/certificates= directory, you must link it to the local =TRUSTED_CA= location (symlink in either direction) and copy the CA files appropriately.

The host, ldap, and http certificate files still go under =/etc/grid-security=.

The [[CertScripts][Certificate Scripts Package Guide]] which has been installed can assist you with choosing Certificate Authorities to trust and periodically checking that the CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) have not expired.

---++ Request and Install Host Certificate

To authorize your resource for use, you need to get a host certificate from an appropriate Certificate Authority. 
   * Currently the [[http://www.doegrids.org][DOEGrids CA]] is the most common CA in use for OSG participants. 
   * The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra][OSG Registration Authority]] with DOEGrids handles most certificate requests for OSG participants. 

Here is a brief guide to the process assuming you have a valid [[UserCertificate][User Certificate]]. 
 
Run the =cert-request= script  to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.
$VDT_LOCATION must point to the package in which the scripts exist, e.g., the CE install directory or where you installed PPDG-Cert-Scripts.  The =-label my-host= option is not required; but if used, use it also below when you install the cert.
<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source  ./setup.sh</b>
# <b>cd vdt/setup/</b>
# <b>cert-request -ou s -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>
Processing OU=Services request.
Give reason (1 line) you qualify for certificate, such as

  collaborating with Condor team,  etc.

You must agree to abide by the DOEGrids pollicies,
at
and you assert that you are authorized to request and install this
certificate on the specified host.
Do you agree (y,N): <b>y</b>

Your Certificate Request has been successfully submitted
Your Certificate Request id: <i>2394</i>

        You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate
        has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your
        certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</pre>
The certificate request will leave a =pem= file in the directory; this will be needed when you retrieve your cert.

%NOTE% It is possible to continue with steps in the install procedure while you are waiting for your host certificate to be approved.

After the certificate is approved you will receive an email which includes the serial number of the new certificate. Use that serial number to retrieve the certificate as shown below.  

From the installation directory (where your ran =cert-request= and where the new =pem= file was placed), run =cert-retrieve=.  Again, only use =-label ...= if you used it in the request.  The =-dir .= puts it in the pwd.  
<pre class="screen">
# <b>cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0x2e7</i> -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>
Checking that the usercert and ./my-hostkey.pem match
writing RSA key
./usercert.pem and ./userkey.pem now contain your Globus credential
</pre>
Now move the =hostcert.pem= and =hostkey.pem= files to =/etc/grid-security= and set permissions:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
# <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
# <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
# <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
</pre>


The following command will verify the certificate is readable.  The output shown will be similar, but specific to your request.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>

</pre>
    
---++ Get an LDAP service certificate to publish your Privilege authorization status
The capability of publishing the status of your Privilege authorization server's status is available in this release.  This is optional and you will be asked if you desire this capability when you configure your CE node using the =configure-osg.sh= script.  If you choose to publish this information, you will need an LDAP service certificate.

Follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating =ldapkey.pem= and =ldapcert.pem=.   This certificate should be should be located in the following directory with ownership and permissions as follows:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir /etc/grid-security/ldap </b>
$ <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem </b>
$ <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chown -R daemon.daemon /etc/grid-security/ldap </b>
</pre>

---++ Get an HTTP service certificate to activate CEMon
See the [[CEInstallGuide#CEmon][CEMon section of this guide]] for the details on activating this service.  You will need the http certificate available before you activate this service.  <i>CEMon</i> runs as a  <i>tomcat</i> service and therefore the HTTP certicate must be owned by the <i>tomcat</i> user (if you installed as <i>root</i>, the owner is probably <i>daemon</i>).

<pre class="screen">
&gt;  <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt;  <b>cert-request -ou s</b> 
                -dir . \
                -host <i>my-host.some.domain</i> \
                -service http \
                -label <i>my-host-http</i>
</pre>

Follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating =httpkey.pem= and =httpcert.pem=.  This certificate should be should be located in the following directory with ownership and permissions as follows:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir /etc/grid-security/http </b>
$ <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chown -R daemon.daemon /etc/grid-security/http </b>
</pre>



---++ Get a Personal Grid Certificate (optional)
A personal grid certificate (or "user certificate"), will be needed to run tests.
See [[UserCertificate][Getting a PKI user certificate and preparing it for use with OSG]].
