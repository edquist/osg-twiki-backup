Several things have to be done to actually enable your VO to begin accepting membership, used for voms proxy generation, and used for the Compatibility and Full  Privilege [[OsgCEAuthorization][authorization modes]] on compute (CE) and storage (SE) element  nodes.

The following sub-sections will reference the default <i>VDT</i> in the text and examples.  When enabling your 'real' VO, the same steps are required and, where different, it will be noted.


---+++Establishing a VO-Admin
A person (or persons) can be designated as the VO-Admin for the VOMS VO created.  This person(s) has administrative capability within VOMS that the normal VO member will not have.  

%NOTE%
If you are doing this for the first time as the _root_ user, you may have to set a couple variables.  Try it without setting them, but if you get an _access denied_  message, this should resolve the problem.
<pre class="screen">
&gt; export X509_USER_CERT=/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
&gt; export X509_USER_KEY=/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
</pre>

There are 2 options for adding this capability to an individual:

<ol>
  <li>The individual <u>is not</u> a member of the VO.   A Global-ACL for that individual with <i>allow all</i> capability allows a person to administer the VO's VOMS from the command line and WEB UI.
    <ul>
      <li>Individual's certificate file is available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>voms-admin -vo <em>VO</em> add-acl-entry Global-ACL \
        allow all <em>usercert.pem</em></b>
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-admin -vo <em>VO</em>  -nousercert  add-acl-entry  Global-ACL \
  allow all \
 "<em>USER DN</em>" "<em>USER CA</em>"</b>
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The individual <u>is</u> a member of the VO.  This can be accomplished by giving the individual the Global-ACL capability above or by first adding them to the VO as a member (described in the next section) and then assigning them the <i>VO-Admin</i> role with the following command:
    <ul>
      <li>Individual's certificate file is available:     
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-admin -vo <em>VO</em> assign-role  <em>GROUP</em> \
                 VO-Admin <em>usercert.pem</em></b>
</pre>
	  </li>
      <li>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-admin -vo <em>VO</em> assign-role  <em>GROUP</em> \
                 VO-Admin  \
                 "<em>USER DN</em>" "<em>USER CA</em>"</b>
</pre>
	  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

---+++Adding  a user to the VO
Individuals with the <i>VO-Admin</i> role or the  <i>allow all</i> Global-ACL are referred to as VO Managers in VOMS and are the only ones who can add new members via the web UI.

In normal practice, users will request VO membership by accessing the <i>New user registration</i> menu item on the main VOMS web page.  This document will not go into the details of that process here, nor will it address the basic usage and navigation of the VOMS web ui.

The purpose of this section is to show you how to add a user for the purposes of assigning the <i>VO-Admin</i> role as a part of the initial setup.   

Four data items are required for each user:
   * DN
   * CA
   * Common Name (CN part of the DN or just 1st and last name so you can be easily identified)
   * email address 


If you have the user's certificate file available, then these 4 items are derived from that.
<ul>
  <li>Individual's certificate file is available:     
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-admin -vo <em>VO</em> add-member  \
       <em>GROUP</em>  <em>usercert.pem</em></b>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-admin -vo <em>VO</em> add-member  \
       <em>GROUP</em>   \
       "<em>USER DN</em>" "<em>USER CA</em>"  \
       "<em>USER CN</em>" <em>USER EMAIL</em>"</b>
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

If you have added the user for the purpose of assigning the <i>VO-Admin</i> role, you will want to re-visit [[VomsInstallGuide#Establishing_a_VO_Admin][Establishing a VO-Admin]] to assign the role.


---+++Verifying you are a VO-Admin
If you've established yourself with the <i>VO-Admin</i> role or with the <i>allow all</i> Global-ACL, you can now go back the VOMS web ui in a browser with your certificate and from the main menu:
   1. Under <i>For VO Managers</i>, select <i>Administer the VO</i>
   1. Then, select <i>Global ACL</i>

You should no longer see the <i>Access Denied</i> error and should be able to see the Global-ACL's  that have been created.   As a <i>VO-Admin</i>, you can do anything you want.  

%NOTE% A user with the <i>VO-Admin</i> role only has these privileges in the VOMS web ui.  The command line <i>voms-admin</i>  does not authorize using the VOMS roles.  It allow <i>voms-admin</i> command line capability, you must establish a Global-ACL with the capability you desire.  By default, only the <i>root</i> user has this on initial installation.


---+++Enabling read-only access to your VO
Another Global-ACL needs to be created with <i>allow list</i> capabilities for anyone that presents a certificate issued by a known VO.  The purpose for this is two-fold:
   * Those sites using [[InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS servers]] will be able to access your VO without the VO-Admin having to individually provide this  Global-ACL capability on a case by case basis.  
   * It allows VO members or (those that think they are VO members) to query the VOMS to troubleshoot problems in getting voms proxies and verify their membership in various groups and role assignments. 

To enable read-only access, execute the following command:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>voms-admin --vo <em>VO</em>  --nousercert add-acl-entry \
   Global-ACL allow list \
   "/O=VOMS/O=System/CN=Any Authenticated User" \
   "/O=VOMS/O=System/CN=Dummy Certificate Authority"</b>
</pre>
