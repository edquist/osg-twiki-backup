---++ Be familiar with the OSG Security web site
Information regarding incident handling, security best practices, awareness training, procedures, etc.
is linked from the main [[Security.WebHome][OSG Security twiki page]].  You should familiarize yourself with
this information and browse through it *before* you have a security incident.  Especially the sections
marked *URGENT* and *Security Awareness for OSG Participants*.
If you have any questions about any of the material *ASK*.
