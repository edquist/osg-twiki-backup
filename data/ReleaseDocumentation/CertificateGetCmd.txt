---+ Getting a certificate with the command line interface

---++ Preparation

%NOTE% If you're going to request a certificate via your web browser, skip this section and jump to the Web browser based instructions below.

Instructions below describe using the cert-scripts package in VDT to request, retrieve and renew a certificate. To check that these are available, execute the following commands
<verbatim>
For sh shell variants:
$ source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh

For csh shell variants:
$ source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.csh

$ cert-request -V
checking CertLib version, V2-7,  This is the latest version, released 18 May 2009.
  cert-request version: V2-7
  CertLib version: V2-7
</verbatim>

If this succeeds then proceed with the script based instructions below. If you get an error, then you can either install the cert-scripts package or use the web browser instructions below.

---+++ Install cert-scripts package
 Follow the instructions for installing the cert-scripts package into a temporary location in the subsection shown at [[ReleaseDocumentation.GetGridCertificates#Certificate_scripts_package][Certificate scripts package]] and then return here to continue with requesting your personal user certificate.

---+++ Before you get your DOEGrids personal certificate
 Before starting, determine which affiliation to choose (this corresponds to a Registration Authority, RA). See the list of RAs on the right side of the [[http://www.doegrids.org/][DOEGrids home page]], or type =cert-request -list=.

You'll also need to list a sponsor, an individual known to the RA who has met you in person and can vouch for your identity. Your VO can help you identify the appropriate sponsor. If you have trouble identifying a known sponsor then use your supervisor as your sponsor and be sure to mention the name of your home institution in the =-reason= message of the =cert-request= script (or "Comments" field of the web form).

Think of a unique passphrase.

Note that a DOEGrids certificate is valid for one year. You will receive email notices from DOEGrids prior to certificate expiration so that you can renew it in time to avoid an interruption in service. These notices are sent to the email address you provide when you request the certificate. If your email address changes before the certificate expires you are required to revoke that certificate, and most probably you should request a new certificate with the new email address (before you revoke the old one ;) ).

---++ Script based instructions
 The instructions here are based on using the default assumptions which includes storing your personal certificate (usercert.pem) and private key (userkey.pem) files in ~/.globus. There are additional options and capabilities available described in the [[Security.CSReadMe][full man pages]].

---+++ Requirements
 See the Preparation section above.

---+++ Obtain a certificate via scripts

has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your         
certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</verbatim>

This example shows all parameters and command line arguments. Notice that multi-word arguments are enclosed in double quotes(") , as is usual for unix commands. The script will prompt you for any required arguments which are omitted. The meaning of these arguments is

   * =-ou p= - *p* means a personal certificate, *s* means a [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][host/service certificate]]. 
   * =-agree= - means you agree to the subscriber obligation in the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf][DOEGrids CP/CPS]]. 
   * =-name= - your full name 
   * =-email= - your email address, preferably from your home institution 
   * =-phone= - your office phone number 
   * =-reason= - a short description of why you need the certificate, and include the name of your home institution 
   * =-affiliation osg= - *osg* is the name of the registration authority to handle this request. These scripts can be used for the other RAs working with DOEGrids. 
   * =-vo VVVV= - *VVVV* should be the name of your virtual organization as registered with OSG, like LIGO, CMS, USATLAS, STAR, etc.<br />If you are working with OSG but your VO is not yet registered with OSG then you can specify the VO as =OSG=. 
   * =-sponsor_name= - the name of your sponsor. 
   * =-sponsor_email= - the email address of your sponsor 
   * =-sponsor_phone= - the phone number of your sponsor 
   * =-label= - a label to use for this request, which is used to name some temporary files that must be available at the time you download the issued certificate with the =cert-retrieve= command. 

---+++ Notification of issuance
 If your request is rejected you should receive some kind of email notice from the RA or an Agent explaining why. After your certificate request is processed and a certificate is issued you will receive an email like:

<verbatim>Subject: DOEGrids CA Certificate Request 
Date: Fri, 30 Nov 2007 14:55:56 -0800 (PST) 
From: DOEGrids-CA-1@doegrids.org 
To: your@email.address  
Your Personal certificate request has been processed successfully. 
SubjectDN= CN=Firstname Lastname 999999,OU=People,DC=doegrids,DC=org 
notAfter= Nov 29, 2008 2:55:51 PM 
notBefore= Nov 30, 2007 2:55:51 PM 
Serial Number= 0xNNNN   
Complete details can be found here: 
https://pki1.doegrids.org:443/displayBySerial?op=displayBySerial&serialNumber=DDDDD  
Your certificate requested using the script interface, 
request id: 99999, has been approved and is available for download.  
To retrieve your certificate, execute the command below using the same 
working directory from which the request was made.  
# cert-retrieve -serialnum DDDDD  
If you requested the certificate with optional parameters specifying labelling 
or a non-standard directory for storing your certificate see the cert-retrieve 
and cert-request man pages for additional explanation. 
# cert-retrieve -help
# cert-request -help
</verbatim>

In the example above =0xNNNN= and =DDDDD= is the certificate serial number in hexadecimal and decimal notation, respectively. =99999= is the same request ID that was shown for the result of =cert-request=.

---++++ cert-retrieve

<verbatim>
$ cert-retrieve -serialnum 0xNNNN -label req1 -p12 mycert.p12
checking CertLib version, V2-5,  This is latest version, released 24 Aug 2007.

</verbatim>

The arguments are:

   * =-serialnum 0xNNNN= - the certificate serial number, 0xNNNN is the hexadecimal form, one can use the decimal form, DDDDD. 
   * =-label= - this label matches that used for the =cert-request= command 
   * =-p12= - optional generation of a PKCS12 format file which can be used to import the certificate into web/email applications. Without the =-p12= flag you will have a single prompt for your *passphrase*, and it must match what you used with the =cert-request= command. If you use the =-p12= flag you a receive another prompt for this same *passphrase* because there is another execution of openssl to produce the PKCS12 file after the certificate is already downloaded. Then you receive a prompt and verification for the *Export Password* which encrypts the PKCS12 file ( =mycert.p12= ). This file is in the format that can be imported into your web browser and email client, and you will use the same *Export Password* so your browser/email can unencrypt it during the import process.
