---+ What is a certificate?

By "certificate", we mean a digital identity certificate, an
electronic or digital signature that a computer program or service may
require prior to access in order to authenticate the 
person (e.g., you), computer or program that is trying to access it.  

Digital certificates are based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology, an arrangement which provides
for third-party vetting of, and vouching for, user identities. PKI
uses a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) to encrypt and
decrypt information securely.  A central principle to this technology is that
the person requesting a certificate generates the public/private key pair and
the private key stays with that person and never shared or made available
for others to copy it. Private keys are usually encrypted so that only the
owner, who knows the passphrase for the encryption, can use the private key.

Somebody has to issue you a certificate, and somebody else must decide
whether to accept your certificate when you present it. This implies
that there must be a "chain of trust" such that the acceptor trusts
the issuer. The issuer of a certificate is an organization called a
Certificate Authority (CA). A CA will only issue you a certificate upon verification by somebody it already knows and trusts. The acceptors (e.g., grid services), in turn,
maintain lists of CAs that they trust.

Certificates can pertain to different types of entities: persons,
hosts and services, and CAs. Host and service certificates are used to authenticate hosts and services to other grid- and web-related programs, hosts and services. Personal certificates are sometimes
called grid certificates because standard grid software requires
authentication via certificates, but use of certificates is not
restricted to grid computing. Other common uses include signing email
messages and administering/accessing restricted web sites.
