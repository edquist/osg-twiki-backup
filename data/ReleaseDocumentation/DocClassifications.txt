<!--
+---+++ Document Types

<!--
Documents can be of several different types.  Types are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_TYPE.  The Templates are recommended formatting and sections to be included in the associated document type.
| *Document Type* | *Definition* | *Template* |
| !HowTo | A procedure telling how to do something | DocHowToTemplate |
| Installation | A specific procedural document for installation of software | DocInstallTemplate |
| Knowledge | Any document not of another type.  E.g. general information, explanation, description. | DocBasicTemplate |
| Navigation | A document designed to help a person navigate to other documents | DocBasicTemplate |
| Planning | A document used for planning.  E.g. Planning an OSG site. | DocBasicTemplate |
| Training | A document designed for training or used organize or manage a training event | DocBasicTemplate |
| Troubleshooting | A troubleshooting document | ReleaseDocumentation.DocTroubleshootingTemplate |
-->

<!--
+---+++ Document User Roles

<!--
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be used by people in another role (called the secondary role).  Since few documents cover multiple roles, we do not specify a secondary role in a document.  Roles are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_ROLE.
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| Developer | Any software developer |
| Documenter | Any person working on documentation itself |
| Scientist | A person submitting jobs to the Grid -- an "End User" |

<!--
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training specifically written for another role would be classified as that role as primary and student as secondary. |
| !SysAdmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOManager | A manager in a Virtual Organization as contrasted with one of the above roles |
-->

<!--
+---+++ Document Areas

<!--
The documentation universe is segmented into a set of areas, each of which has an owner having overall responsibility for the documentation of that area.  The Areas are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_AREA.
| *Documentation Area* | *Definition* | *Area Owner* |
| !ComputeElement | Compute Element | Main.SuchandraThapa |
