---+!! How to get Help?
%TOC%

---+ About this Document 
This page is aimed at OSG users or site administrators looking for support channels beside the [[WebHome][OSG Documentation]].

---+ Introduction
If you are looking for documents you'll find an overview here below.
If you are approaching OSG and looking for help to get started or is you are a user submitting jobs to OSG or a site administrator look to the appropriate section here below.

If you have been sent here from a technical document look at the "Information Required to Help You" section and choose your preferred VO or OSG support channel below.

---++ OSG Documents
There are documents targeting from the novice to the experienced user or site administrator.
If you are new to OSG we recommend you to check [[WhatIsOSG][this introduction]].

A good starting point for users is Documentation.UsingTheGrid

On the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][OSG Web Site]] you can find pointers to technical documentation, monitoring, events and general information.
<!-- [[Documentation.WebHome][]] -->
The [[Main.WebHome][OSG Twiki]] is the main documentation hub. Especially the [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][Release documentation Web]], containing documents about the current release, is a good starting point for site administrators installing a Compute Element or a Storage Element.

If you are looking for informations and examples on bringing up a cluster from scratch you should look at the [[Tier3.WebHome][Tier 3 guide]].


---++ New to OSG
If you are part of an organization that already present in OSG, like the LHC experiments, we recommend you to contact your organization first. Some have support and contact informations [[#VO_Resources][below]].

If you are approaching the grid you can read the [[WhatIsOSG][introduction]] suggested above and then you may contact the Engagement VO (see below) to get you started in using the grid. 

*USER SUPPORT INFO MISSING*

---++ OSG User 
If you are already using OSG and are having problems you may [[#Trouble_Tickets][open a ticket]] about the resource or the software that is causing problems or come to the [[#Chat_support][Campfire web chat as explained below]] to receive direct support. An email to one of [[#Email_Lists_for_Support][our mailing lists]] is also a good way to receive help.

*USER SUPPORT INFO MISSING*

---++ Site administrator os OSG or ITB resources
If you are having troubles in installing and configuring OSG resources you can get support coming to the [[#Chat_support][Campfire web chat]] or sending an email to [[#Email_Lists_for_Support][one of our mailing lists]]. It the problem is a bug or some unresponsive resource you may also [[#Trouble_Tickets][open a ticket]] about it.

The [[#Grid_Operations_Center][OSG Grid Operation Center]] provides also [[#Emergency_Assistance][emergency assistance]] via phone support.

---+++ Security incident
Security incidents can be reported by following the instructions on the [[ReleaseDocumentation/IncidentDiscoveryReporting][Incident Discovery and Reporting]] page.  Additional steps to aid in the incident handling process are also linked from that page.

---+ Information Required to Help You

If you came to this page from an Installation or an !HowTo document in this Twiki, then follow instructions in the *Troubleshooting* and *Debugging* sections of the document and include results in your support inquiry, no matter which channel you choose (email, trouble ticket, web chat, ...) 

For problems with installations of some %LINK_VDT% software run =vdt-system-profiler=:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% vdt-system-profiler
</pre>

And attach =vdt-profile.txt= to your support inquiry.

---+ VO Assistance
If your VO provides user support, that should be your first line of support because it is more familiar with your applications and requirements.
If not, below there are OSG support resources.

The list of support contacts for OSG VOs can be found in the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/scsummary/index?datasource=summary&summary_attrs_showdesc=on&summary_attrs_showcontact=on&all_scs=on&active=on&active_value=1][MyOSG Support Center Tab]].
The [[#VO_Resources][VO Resources section here after]] provides additional support resources from some VO.
