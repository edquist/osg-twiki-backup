---+ OSG Security Policies and Procedures

OSG security policies are developed by the OSG security team, when appropriate in conjunction with JSPG (see below). Draft policies are approved by the OSG Executive Board and then officially endorsed by the OSG Council.
Some policies are developed jointly with JSPG, whereas some are developed solely by the OSG security team. A policy that is developed jointly with the JSPG addresses common requirements across WLCG, EGEE and OSG. For each joint policy, OSG generates an OSG-specific document, which adheres to the JSPG policy, but also states additional OSG-specific requirements.

---++ Approved Security Policies

The following OSG policies are approved and in effect:

---++ JSPG

OSG participates in the Joint Security Policy Group ([[http://www.jspg.org/][JSPG]]), which aims to generate common security policies across WLCG, EGEE and other grids such as OSG. The JSPG policies are often defined at a higher level and state common requirements across grids. A JSPG policy is designed to be accompanied by a grid-specific document where the grid defines its own specifics to a JSPG policy. JSPG submits documents to WLCG MB and EGEE TMB for approval. OSG adopts JSPG policies independently and is not required to adopt all JSPG policies. The top level JSPG [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/428008][Grid Security Policy]] specifies the overall framework that the other JSPG policies fit into. The list of working documents of the JSPG are at http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj-lcg-security/documents.html. Jim Basney (OSG Security Policy Officer) participates in the JSPG.
