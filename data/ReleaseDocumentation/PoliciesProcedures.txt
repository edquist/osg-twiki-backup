---++ OSG Policies and Procedures

OSG security policies are developed by OSG security team, when appropriate in conjunction with JSPG (see below). A draft policy would first seek OSG Executive Board's approval, and then is sent to OSG Council for official endorsement.

The compete list of OSG policies and agreement templates can be found below. Some policies are developed jointly with JSPG (indicated by the fourth and fifth columns of the table), whereas some are developed solely by the OSG security team. A policy that is developed jointly with the JSPG addresses common requirements across WLCG, EGEE and OSG. For each joint policy, OSG generates an OSG-specific document, which adheres to the JSPG policy, but also states additional OSG-specific requirements. A policy's status indicates its position at the approval process. Although some policies are identified to be necessary, they are still in their infancy, or work-in-progress (indicated by N/A in the table).

The latest versions of the documents are linked below. There are policies that are specific enough to OSG that they are not developed jointly, hence only listed as OSG documents.

---+++ JSPG

OSG participates in the Joint Security Policy Group ([[http://www.jspg.org/][JSPG]]), which aims to generate common security policies across WLCG, EGEE and other grids such as OSG. The JSPG policies are often defined at a higher level and state common requirements across grids. A JSPG policy is designed to be accompanied by a grid-specific document where the grid defines its own specifics to a JSPG policy. JSPG submits documents to WLCG MB and EGEE TMB for approval. OSG adopts JSPG policies independently and is not required to adopt all JSPG policies. The top level JSPG [[https://edms.cern.ch/document/428008][Grid Security Policy]] specifies the overall framework that the other JSPG policies fit into. The list of working documents of the JSPG are at http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj-lcg-security/documents.html. Jim Basney (OSG Security Policy Officer) participates in the JSPG.

Minutes from the [[http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=31918][May 29-30 2008 JSPG]] meeting are available at [[MeetingNotesfromJSPG_08][here]].
