---++ Incident Discovery and Reporting

The cyberspace defined by Grids transcends organizational boundaries. Although the Grid doesn't create 
fundamentally new cyber security risks it does serve to amplify some risks. A compromised identity or resource at 
one institution presents immediate risk of further compromise, attack, or identity theft to all institutions 
participating in the grid. All security incidents must be reported *immediately*.

If you suspect a security problem  e-mail security@opensciencegrid.org, or abuse@opensciencegrid.org (This email address is being protected 
from spam bots.  Javascript must be enabled to view it.) Or call Grid Operation Center (GOC) at +1 317-278-9699. In addition, a ticket to GOC can also be submitted. 

In  your email to GOC (security@opensciencegrid.org), the following information must be included: 

   * the name of the responders;

   * phone; 

   * alternate phone; 

   * e-mail address;

   * Grid Virtual Organization (VO);

   * whether your grid identity been compromised ; 

   * incident description, including time(s), systems involved and their description; 

   * any other additional information, e. g. contacts, etc.

OSG [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=19&version=2&filename=OSG_incident_handling_v1.0.pdf][Incident Response Plan]] is also available. 

If you (as the reporting party) are unfamiliar with the incident reporting process, there are a few things you should be aware of.

   1. if the incident involves your local/home organization, in addition to involving the Grid, you must report to your home/local organization by using its incident handling process,

   2. Each local organization that is a member of the grid has security contacts announced to the Grid management. If you are not the grid security contact for your local organization,  you should report the incident to the security contact designated for your organization.  

    If you already know your organization's grid security contact and have already reported the incident to him/her, you may not have to take any further action. It is the responsibility of the grid security contact to report incidents to the Grid management. In any other case, you must immediately use the email and phone numbers provided above for reporting to the Grid management.
