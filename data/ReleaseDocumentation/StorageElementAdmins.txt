This page contains how-to guides and other necessary information for setting up a Storage Element (SE) or testing a Storage Element Implementation.

For information about CE-Storages ($DATA, ...) and their configuration, please refer to [[LocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] and [[LocalStorageRequirements][Local Storage Requirements]] (for requirements and specification).

---++ Setup of Storage Element (SE)

%RED%Is this page needed? Maybe just for the gridftp-based thing and maybe srm-tester? The other setups are  just links.%ENDCOLOR%
---+++ !!How to Setup SE based on Gridftp-based File System

The easiest way to install a Gridftp server with all the required certificates is using VDT (or even the whole OSG package). There is no special requirement about the directory: it has to be a valid path for the Gridftp server and have the protections set to provide the desired access to Grid users. Sometime sticky (only the creator of a file can remove it) or setgroup (group is maintained in subdirectories) ids may be useful.

Making a Gridftp-based File System that is also a CE-Storage (like OSG_DATA) involves creating a data directory and mounting it on all worker nodes so the storage is accessible to applications running on that site via some environment variables. The SE (host, port, path) has then to point to the same data directory.

---++ How to Test SE Implementation

%RED%Gridcat is deprecated, so how to use srm-tester?%ENDCOLOR%
      <nop>SRM-TESTER is available to test SRM based storage sites as well as popular file transfer protocol such as gsiftp, http or ftp, based storage sites. SRM-TESTER is integrated into the GridCat and also available as a stand-alone tester. SRM-TESTER can be installed through VDT pacman, or downloadable from http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist.

The SRM Client Tools are an optional module in the OSG Cache. They are supported by the SRM-dCACHE team: srm@lbl.gov.
