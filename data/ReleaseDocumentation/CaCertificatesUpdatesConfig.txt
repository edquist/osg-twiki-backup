---++ Configure the CA Certificate Handling

%EDITTHIS%

%NOTE% This applies to OSG 1.2 installations, there is a [[OSG10CACertificatesUpdates][separate page]] for OSG 1.0 installions .

As of September 2008, certificate authority certificates will no longer be installed and configured during installation.  Many components of the installation will not work until these are installed.  In order to finish installing the CA-Certificates package on your system you will need to do the following one-time configuration.  For more information, see http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html

Run the following to setup up your certificates for OSG CA distributions
<pre class="screen">
# source VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
# vdt-ca-manage setupca --location [root|local|&lt;PATH&gt;] --url [osg|vdt|&lt;URL&gt;]

 Location:
    root - install into /etc/grid-security
    local - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share
    PATH - install into PATH (e.g. /nfs/certificates)
</pre>

A common example is to install the OSG-provided certificates into the OSG install directory.  If you are not quite sure what to do, this is a safe option:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
</pre>

There are 2 additional services associated with certificate authorities:
   1 _vdt-update-certs_ - a cron service that insures that future certificate updates are fetched automatically.
   1 _fetch-crl_ - a cron service that retrieves the latest certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for each CA.

On Compute Element (CE) installs, the enabling of these services  is performed by the _configure-osg_ script based on the following option in the _config.ini_ file:
<pre>
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
</pre>
