---++ Configure the CA Certificate Handling

%EDITTHIS%

You must install the CA-Certificates package on your system doing the following one-time configuration.  It is not included in the CE package to force you to acknowledge which CA you are accepting. Many components of the installation will not work until these certificates are installed. For more information, see http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html

Run the following to setup up your certificates for OSG CA distributions
<pre class="screen">
# source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
# vdt-ca-manage setupca --location [root|local|&lt;PATH&gt;] --url [osg|vdt|itb|&lt;URL&gt;] [--no-update] [--force]

 Location:
    root - install into /etc/grid-security
    local - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share
    PATH - install into PATH (e.g. /nfs/certificates)
</pre>

A common example is to install the OSG-provided certificates into the OSG install directory.  If you are not quite sure what to do, this is a safe, self-contained option: <pre class="screen">vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
</pre>

If you install CAs through RPM or DEB packages or any other external method, please specify the --no-update option. Setting this option instructs the setup to create just the symlinks and not to configure vdt-update-certs to be run automatically. This option is for installations that will not manage their own certificates, but will rely on updates through another method (such as RPM, or using vdt-update-certs from a different VDT installation). Another common use case for this is to have worker-node installations rely on the CA certificates being available on an NFS share, and the updating will happen on a single node.  
<pre class="screen">
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location /path/to/CADir --no-update
</pre>


There are 2 additional services associated with certificate authorities:
   1 _vdt-update-certs_ - a cron service that insures that future certificate updates are fetched automatically.
   1 _fetch-crl_ - a cron service that retrieves the latest certificate revocation lists (CRLs) for each CA.

On Compute Element (CE) installs, the enabling of these services  is performed by the _configure-osg_ script based on the following option in the _config.ini_ file:
<pre>
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
</pre>
