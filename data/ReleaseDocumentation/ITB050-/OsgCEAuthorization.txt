---+!!<nop>OSG CE Authorization
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction
The Authorization mode determines who can access your resources and how. A good description of the available authorization scenarios can be found on  the
<a href="http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_architecture.html#GUMS_in_the_grid_architecture">
GUMS web site</a>.  Of those discussed, OSG supports three, namely: Grid3/Local, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. All three use VOMS. Here's a brief explanation of each follows.



---+++<nop>Grid3 or local <nop>GridMap file
Authorization is performed only via the <i>grid-mapfile</i> on the Compute Element (CE) node. 

The grid-mapfile is either created manually on each CE node, or created using the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> root cron entry based upon the configuration file <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file located in <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc</i>. This file is installed by the VO package which can be updated to add or update VO information. The OSG Operations sends update announcements to each support center.  VOMS is used; GUMS is not used. 

Synchronizing all the <i>grid-mapfiles</i> for multiple CE nodes needs to be done manually in this case.  You may prefer this configuration if:
      <UL><LI>You are a small site (one gatekeeper) and,
               <LI>You deal with a small set of fairly static VOs
               <LI>You are <b>not</b> supporting <i>role-based</i> authorizations (voms proxies with extended attributes)
       </UL>

---+++<nop>Compatibility
Authorization is performed via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper, and the file is created by GUMS.  

GUMS polls VOMS Admin periodically and creates/updates the grid-mapfile. If the site has only one GUMS server (one communication point to VOMS), centralized mapping is enabled. Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).  You should consider this configuration if:
      <UL><LI>Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured using a grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipulate this file directly, without passing through globus)
                <LI>You'd rather approach with caution than jump right into running GUMS 24/7.
       </UL>

---+++Full Privilege (role-enabled) 
This scenario implements the PRIMA authorization module with GUMS and does not use the grid-mapfile.  The gatekeeper uses a callout to PRIMA upon receipt of each request, PRIMA forwards the request to the GUMS web service which performs the dynamic mapping. PRIMA can process FQAN (Fully Qualified Attribute Names), thus enabling mapping based on VO groups and roles as defined in VOMS.

We'll present the "how to" information in order of simplest (Grid3) to most sophisticated (full privilege) so that you can implement step-by-step and test as you go, if you like.
---++Changes effective with this release
Prior to this release, the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script run as a system  service and installed in <i>/etc/init.d</i>. With this release, it is being installed as a <i>root</i> crontab entry.  
If you are upgrading from a prior release, you must <i>stop</i> the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> daemon and delete that entry from system services.
<b>Note:</b> It is not installed/configured by default.

   $ %I% %RED% *NOTE* %ENDCOLOR%: It is not installed/configured by default.

---++ Grid3 or Local configuration
In this mode, authorization is performed only via the <i>/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</i> on the CE (gatekeeper) node. The <i>grid-mapfile</i> is created/maintained either:
   *  manually on each gatekeeper, 
   * or created from the VOMS Admin servers for each VO you are supporting using the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script.  VOMS is used; GUMS is not used. If you are supporting mutiple CE nodes for your site, synchronizing all the <i>grid-mapfiles</i> across these nodes is difficult.
Using a configuration file that identifies the VOMS servers for each VO your CE node supports, the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script will  pull down the VO's membership from those VOMS servers and create a new <i>grid-mapfile</i> with each invocation.

The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script is run as a cron entry with the times set randomly when  <i>configure_edg_make_gridmap</i> is run:

Before you configure your CE node to use the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script via cron, you should probably (all described in subsequent sections):
   * verify/determine the list of VO's you will be supporting
   * determine/setup your CE node for use of a local gridmap file
   * test the script and verify it produces the desired results


During installation, a default OSG configuration file, <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>,  is created providing access to all registered and approved OSG VOs VOMS servers. Review this configuration file:

   * If the list is acceptable to you, then you're done with this step. 
   * If not, then you will need to edit the file and commenting out the line(s) for each VO you wish to disable.

Comment lines start with "#" as in a shell script. This file is periodically updated by the OSG GOC and new/updated versions are issued.  For this reason, it is recommended that you do not delete entries, but comment them.  This will allow you to do a comparison of your current configuration against any new OSG version more accurately and you will be more readily aware of those VOs you omitted intentionally.

---+++ Setup and test access to each selected VOMS service

&gt  ./edg-mkgridmap  --output=test.out
The <i>test.out</i> file contains all the gridmap entries for the supported VO's and any local gridmap entries, if specified.
If you see any messages when you run the command, the members of those VO's will not appear in the <i>test.out</i> file. If you look at the files created from the above test, you will notice that the script makes a backup of your current file with a '.1' suffix.  Since this was the initial running of the script, the <i>test.out.1</i> is empty.

If the VO administrator has not enabled world read of the VO membership, then you must contact the VO
administrator and request that your site be given access to the VOMS database. You will need to provide
the Subject and Issuer Distinguished Names (DN) for your host certificate.  The simplest thing to do is send email
to the VO administrator requesting access and including the output of the command (check that the path to the hostcert.pem is correct for you):

---++ Compatibility Mode Configuration
In Compatibliity mode, authorization is still performed using the <i>grid-mapfile</i>.  The difference is in the source of the VO membership data/account assignments.  Instead of each CE node pulling independently from the VO VOMS servers.  Each CE node for your site pulls the data from your site's GUMS server.  Thus, centralized mapping is enabled.  Your site's GUMS server polls the VOs' VOMS servers much the same as the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> process did, the difference being that all CE nodes account assignments are managed in one place, the GUMS server.  Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).

<UL>
<LI>You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. 
<LI>You will introduce delays since each gatekeeper will have to regenerate the map before implementing the new policy or allowing new users. 
</UL>
A couple of points to be aware of regarding this configuration relative to Full Privilege:
   * You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. 
<UL>
<LI>One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username
<LI>The GUMS client program <i>gums-host</i> running via cron on your gatekeeper(s) to retrieve both the forward and inverse maps (forward is DN-to-account, inverse is user-to-VO).
</UL>
In the compatibility configuration, you will have:
   * One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username
   * The GUMS client program <i>gums-host</i> running via cron on your gatekeeper(s) to retrieve both the forward and inverse maps (forward is DN-to-account, inverse is user-to-VO).

---+++Compatibility Mode Requirements
Your site needs to install and configure a GUMS service. There needs to be one GUMS server per map of 'DN to local uid'. An institution would only need one GUMS server if there is a global uid assignment (eg. a single NIS domain).  If you will have multiple account domains, you will need a GUMS server for each domain.   Each account domain can cover  any number of CE hosts, clusters storage elements (SEs)  as long as all systems have a consistent set of POSIX Users|UIDs|Groups|GIDs. 

The CE administrator enable and configure the GUMS client software on the CE node(s), and for each CE, identify the appropriate GUMS server to point to (if more than one is available).

The GUMS-Client package  is installed as part of the OSG CE install.  The essential files are located in the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/gums</i> directory.

In this example, cmssrv09.  For, compatibility mode, only the <i>gums.location</i> need be changed to the hostname of your GUMS server.

This scenario implements the PRIMA authorization module with GUMS and does not use the grid-mapfile.  The gatekeeper uses a callout to PRIMA. Upon receipt of each request, PRIMA forwards the request to the GUMS web service which performs the dynamic mapping of the user's certrificate to a UNIX account.

In this configuration, requests to your gatekeeper(s) and gsiftp service(s) use the authorization callout to contact the  GUMS authorization service  which checks whether the requester is permitted access and, if access is permitted, returns a local user id assigned to the requester's grid credential. This removes the need for maintaining grid mapfiles on each gatekeeper and/or gridftp server.

The GUMS-Client package is installed as part of the OSG CE install.  The essential files are located in the =$VDT_LOCATION/gums= directory.

You need to edit the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/gums/etc/gums-client.properties</i> configuration file to point to the appropriate GUMS server:  Upon installation the file contains 2 entries both populated with the hostname of the CE node you are configuring.  In this example, cmssrv09.

   gums.authz=https://cmssrv09:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</pre>

The <i>gums.authz</i> entry is only used if you wish to use the <i>gums</i> client tool to test specific mappings from this host.  Documentation of this can be found on the GUMS web site.  This same functionality can be executed using the GUMS web UI.
