---++ Introduction

This is a minimal set of executables that need to be made available to the worker nodes in a Compute Element.

These client programs need to be available from the worker node 
so that jobs which need to access grid-enabled mass storage during
the job (e.g. via globus-url-copy, VDS, or srmcp) can do so.  The worker
node also has to have either via NFS or locally a good set of 
certificate authority files with up to date certificate revocation 
lists (CRL's) for those clients to work properly.

There are essentially three installation options:

   1. _Suggested Installation:_ Install the wn-client package on the file server separate from the CE that you use for $APP. You will be installing the fetch-crl program onto this node, which requires root access, and adds a script into cron . The updates require outgoing network access from the node it is installed on.  (Should arrange to make it accessible from the CE as well). %BR% %BR%  _(S. Timm note: What happens  once the WN-client starts to include SUID executables, which it eventually will?  This mode won't work then.)_
   1. _CE installation:_ Install the wn-client package on your CE. While we do not suggest you do this, we provide instructions, and support this installation as an option.  
   1. _Local Installation:_  In principle, it is possible to install the wn-client package locally on all worker nodes. In practice, this introduces a number of complications due to the edg-crl updates. We include a set of instructions for this from Alan Sill, but do not support this installation variant officially via OSG operations.

In all cases you need to choose a path that is common to all worker nodes (and the CE?!) You will be prompted for this path when running the =configure-osg.sh= script on the gatekeeper in order to set the =$OSG_GRID= variable.

%RED% If you answer "n" to the option to install the CA certificate files, it will install them anyway (in the "local" directory $OSG_GRID/globus/share/certificates) and puts an extraneous symlink into /etc/grid-security/certificates/certificates, also points (incorrectly) $OSG_GRID/globus/TRUSTED_CA symlink to the wrong place.  Can be worked  around by  selecting "l" for installing the CA certificate files, which is what you should be doing in all the scenarios below anyway.  &emdash; S. Timm 10/12/06 %ENDCOLOR%

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

            (existing CA files will be preserved)
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
l
Do you want to run a cron job that will upate the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible Answers:
     y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
        this one..
n
     s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
        there is already an instance running, leave it alone.

It then asks where you would like to install the CA files and whether to run the
fetch-crl cron script.

For the suggested installation option, i.e. option (1) where you install this worker node client
package on the file server that serves $APP, and you have no previous installation of
the fetch-crl cron script, you should answer "l" for the location and "y" to run the fetch-crl cron.

If you are installing this worker node client on the OSG CE, i.e. option (2) answer "l" for local 
location of CRL and "n" on running the cron script.

This process on many worker nodes can be automated with 
the following script so you don't have to type in the letters.

Look at crontab -l for root, make sure that the fetch-crl that is there is running from the correct area. Make sure that it's sourcing the correct location.


Example: If the OSG CE is installed in =/usr/local/vdt= , then the OSG WN Client is installed in =/usr/local/grid=

   * Installation of the worker node client package does imply maintenance of the certificates that it installs.  As an alternative, it is possible to simply rsync the installed full osg installation to the worker nodes, and independently of whether this option is chosen, use rsync to keep the certificates up to date.   This is true as long as the "Worker Node Client" pacman package remains a pure subset of the OSG CE installation, which is true at the moment.
   * Doing anything automatically on the worker nodes requires care.  An example script that looks to see what worker nodes on a cluster using pbsnodes is attached to this page.  It can be edited or replaced with a more general version to match your specific cluster conditions.  Note that the example script does not use the batch system itself, but uses a feature of the local batch scheduler to avoid trying to push certificates to worker nodes that are down and to build a list of operating nodes to receive the update.  To use this script with the greatest amount of integration into existing certificate update procedures, it can be called just after the edg-fetch-crl call in the edg/sbin/edg-crl-upgrade script that should be in the edg/sbin area of your OSG VDT installation.  Example code to do so would look like:

   * [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/][OSG cache directory]]
   * [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/itb/][ITB cache directory]]
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache/][VDT 1.6.1 cache directory]]
