%EDITTHIS%

[[GridCat][Integration.GridCat]] is a high level grid cataloging system using status dots on geographic maps as well as a catalog of participating sites. The status dots display site's health. The catalog contains information on site readiness, site problems, a brief reason for problems, number of job slots available, and disk space available with other valuable information per site to help job submission and job scheduling for application users and grid develpers. [[GridCat][Integration.GridCat]] tries to present the grid-site at its simplest status representation. It is used as an operations tool as well as a monitoring service.

More [[http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat][at the Integration.GridCat Home]]

!Integration.GridCat was started as a web page code development project within iVDGL and as a subproject for the Grid3 project to support the high level grid site status cataloging. First release was made with the version number 0.0.1 on April 2, 2004.

Currently, [[GridCat][Integration.GridCat]] is deployed for monitoring Grid3 project : [[http://www.ivdgl.org/grid3/catalog][Grid3 Catalog]] 

OSG-ITB instance of the [[GridCat][Integration.GridCat]] is deployed as: [[http://www.ivdgl.org/osg-int/gridcat/][OSG-ITB Integration.GridCat]]

!Integration.GridCat is operated by aggregating information from all participating computing service and storage service sites. It uses MySQL database to store site status information. The database can be accessed using a xml-rpc client tool. Certain site requirements should be met for a site information to be displayed correctly. 

---++Site Requirements
In order for a computing or storage service site to be added, the site has to pass at least one 'globusrun -a -r hostname'<br/>
!Integration.GridCat tests grid site status. The four fundamental !Integration.GridCat tests for a computing service site that will determine site's Green/Red status dot are:
   1. Authentication Test:  =globusrun -a -r hostname/jobmananger-batch=
   1. <nop>HelloWorld Test: =globus-job-run hostname /bin/echo "Hello World"=
   1. Batch Test: is a combination of Batch submission, Batch Query, and Batch Cancel
      * Batch submission:   =globus-job-submit hostname/jobmanager-batch /bin/sleep 57=
         * This gives jobid with the format =<nop>https://hostname:port/numeric_1/numeric_2=
      * Batch Query:  =globus-job-status jobid=
      * Batch Cancel, using fork jobmanager and =globus-job-clean -force -r hostname jobid=
   1. gsiftp file transfer test out- and in-bound: =globus-url-copy file:///a/b/c gsiftp://hostname/usually_tmp/c= and, if successful,=globus-url-copy gsiftp://hostname/usually_tmp/c file:///a/b/c=

In addition to the site status tests, Integration.GridCat obtains fundamental site information using the [[http://giis.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/Integration.CoreMIS][Integration.CoreMIS (MIS-CI)]] information collector and jobmanager-mis which is included by default beginning the OSG-ITB 0.1.4. MIS-CI's sensor collects information and puts them in SQLite database in the site. The information can be queried using the jobmanager-mis which is based on the jobmanager-fork and customized.<br/>

Information collected from MIS-CI are Jobs and Disks. Jobs information is the number of available CPU slots for batch submission over total available CPU slots which could be different from the number in "CPUs" column of the Integration.GridCat display because Jobs information is obtained dynamically and from the batch system's jobs query which could provide only all the batch slots configured independently of the site's intended CPUs provision. Disks information is the number of disk space available in Gbyte for the direcotries, $app, $data, $tmp, $wntmp, and osg installation over the total disk space from which these directories are mounted.

The Integration.GridCat tests for a storage service vary depending on storage services advertised through the storage service's information provider which could have a different hostname from the storage service host. Typically, in- and out-bound file tranfer client command execution must be carried out successfully in order for a storage service to be functional. The client command execution commands include globus-url-copy or srmcp for gsiftp and srm protocol, respectively. At the moment, these two service protocols are supported by Integration.GridCat. Integration.GridCat performs only very simple in- and out-bound file tranfer tests.

In order for a site to be cataloged to the OSG-ITB Integration.GridCat instance, a few requirements should be met. If the site is a computing service (CS in Integration.GridCat display), these requirements should be met :
   1. [[http://giis.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/Integration.OsgItbInstallation][Installation and configuration of OSG-ITB]]
   1. The site's gatekeeper hostname should be sent to the OSG-ITB Integration.GridCat administrator.

If the site is a storage service (SS in Integration.GridCat display), these requirements should be met :<br/>
   1. Storage service hostname
   1. Information Provider protocol, hostname, and port number
   1. Information Provider query string, e.g., "mds-vo-name=USCMS-FNAL-WC1,o=grid", should be sent to the Integration.GridCat administrator

If the site is neither CS nor SS, the service COULD BE displayed in Integration.GridCat by providing:
   1. The site's hostname
   1. A list of supported services in the site 

---+++Setting Site State To Active
At the moment, all CS sites initially added to Integration.GridCat are presumed to be inactive. All SS sites initially added to Integration.GridCat are presumed to be active. Inactive CS sites will have the site status dot with the grey color. Once the site becomes active, the site status dot will become either green or red, depending on the Integration.GridCat test results.

Since the default site state is presumed to be inactive, the CS site admin has to proactively switch the site state to be active. The switching can be done by modifying the file

<pre>
$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info
</pre>
d83 1
If the value of grid_site_state_bit is 1, the site commences its active state (i.e., the content of =$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info=) will look like:

<pre>
export grid_site_state_bit=1
</pre>

%NOTE% It might take up to 2 hours until this change takes effect in the <nop>Integration.GridCat display.
   $ %I% %RED% *NOTE* %ENDCOLOR%: It might take up to 2 hours until this change takes effect in the <nop>Integration.GridCat display.

If the site decides to become inactive for various reasons, e.g., site maintenance, the site admin can set the value of grid_site_state_bit to be other than 1.  See an [[http://www.ivdgl.org/MIS-CI/grid-site-state-info][example grid-site-state-info file]]. 


---++So How Can I Add My Site to Integration.GridCat
In order for a site to be added to Integration.GridCat, the site admin should request site addition to the grid operations center (GOC) and typically a hostname should be sent to the OSG grid operations center (GOC) [[goc-at-opensciencegrid-dot-org]]. Then, GOC will send the request to Integration.GridCat administrator.

---++Extracting Integration.GridCat Information
Integration.GridCat provides xml-rpc service from the Integration.GridCat instance to provide collected information to grid users . The Integration.GridCat service can be accessed using Integration.GridCat client. Two versions of Integration.GridCat client are provided with python and perl languages. Perl version requires various other perl module installation and is more difficult to set up. Python version is recommended to be used. They can be obtained from:
   * [[http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat/gcatc.py][Integration.GridCat Client python version]]
   * [[http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat/gcatc.pl][Integration.GridCat Client perl version]]

Integration.GridCat client accesses database and displays necessary information. The following information query are implemented and can be obtained using the client.

Sitename is determined by the site admin during installation (See OSG-ITB installation quick guide above) . It is a desriptive short name for a collection of services within the site.

Facility name in Integration.GridCat is logically chosen during Integration.GridCat instantiation. The convention is to take the TOP LEVEL domain (TLD) name. For example, ufloridaigt.phys.ufl.edu has the TLD, UFL.EDU, so, .EDU is remove to name it as the ufloridaigt's facility name.
Facility name in <nop>Integration.GridCat is logically chosen during <nop>Integration.GridCat instantiation. The convention is to take the <span class="firstterm">Top Level Domain (TLD)</span>. For example, the TLD of =ufloridaigt.phys.ufl.edu= is =ufl.edu=. Removing the =.edu= gives you the  facility name for =ufloridaigt=.
Facility is meant to be an administrative domain which is managed/operated by a number of site admins in the site. In other words, the facilities name is what describes the local administrative domain. For example at UF we have two clusters on grid3. One is the production cluster dedicated to CMS the is a production cluster for everyone. The policies implemented on each batch system differs in terms of what percetage CMS gets when compared to others. Our facility name describes the admin group here at UF HEP.  So, in gridcat, "Facility" is a level above "Site", but all displays in Integration.GridCat is arranged using the concept of "Site".

CPUs are a fixed number of CPUs which the site is presumably providing. This number is taken from batch system information and this number is populated initially using this information. However, this number can be mostly accurately provide by the site admin only. BNL site is such an example.

---++Interactively Updating Integration.GridCat
As a site admin, Integration.GridCat information may be updated interactively. Site name, Facility name, and CPUs are three fields that can be updated by site admins. Also a site status test can be performed as the site admin.  These interactive site admin role can be activated by sending an email to Integration.GridCat operator or adding a line in the following format:

The !Integration.GridCat tests for an SE vary depending on storage services advertised through the SE information provider which could have a different hostname from the SE host itself. Typically, in- and out-bound file tranfer client command execution must be carried out successfully in order for a storage service to be functional. The client command execution commands include globus-url-copy or srmcp for gsiftp and srm protocol, respectively. At the moment, these two service protocols are supported by !Integration.GridCat. !Integration.GridCat performs only very simple in- and out-bound file tranfer tests.

After these three fundamental parameters are provided to the Grid Operations Center via the resource registration forms, they will be provided to !Integration.GridCat. As the first SE test, !Integration.GridCat will try an ldapsearch query on which services are provided (gsiftp and/or SRM). Then, !Integration.GridCat will construct the second test command string.

Outbound tests are performed similarly.

If the LDAP query is successful and inbound and outbound tests pass for each service provided, the !Integration.GridCat status will become green for the SE.

In order for !Integration.GridCat to parse srm access root directory, etc, the BDII or MDS must have been configured with GIP. In the above example, the GIP is configued using the BDII service. However, since MDS comes with the OSG CE which could act as the information provider for both CE and SE or MDS can be installed on the SE directly, it is convenient for the site admin to configure the GIP.

To check if GIP configuration for SE, this script [[http://gdsuf.phys.ufl.edu:8080/releases/gridcat/gridcat-verify-ss-info.sh.txt][gridcat-verify-ss-info.sh]] can be used. The script reads in the number of Protocols, !GlueSEUniqeID, and VO from an ldapsearch (=ldapsearch -x -l 30 -b mds-vo-name=local,o=grid -h <<ldap_host_for_SE>> -p <<ldap_port_for_SE>>=) and then it compares these are aligned well with each other. If everything is as expected, the script will say 'Looks ok' and print a summary.
