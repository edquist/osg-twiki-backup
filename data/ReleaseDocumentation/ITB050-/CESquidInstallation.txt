---+!! CE Squid Installation

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%
---+++ !Integration.Squid 

The OSG and ITB caches both provide squid pacman packages.  Squid is a web caching service that speeds up downloads from http servers by locally caching files and serving the cached files rather than retrieving the files over the internet.  Due to the disk and memory requirements for squid, the typical use case would be for squid to be installed on a single server on a cluster with CE nodes using that server to proxy http and https requests.  Tests that were done in the ITB with Squid server on the same node as the CE led to rapid crash of the CE, therefore it is strongly recommended to install the Squid server on a different node from the gatekeeper.

---++++ Download and Installation

%BLUE% This is entirely optional since squid does not have to be running on the same server. %ENDCOLOR% You need to install an additional package for squid.  Install squid in your =$VDT_LOCATION= using one of the following commands as appropriate:

<pre>
> pacman -get OSG:squid
</pre>

Or for OSG-ITB substitute _ITB_ for _OSG_ :
<pre>
pacman -get ITB:squid
</pre>

---++++ Configuration

If your site is using a squid server, you can indicate by answering appropriately while answering the questions that configure-osg.sh  asks.  In particular, you will need to answer =y= to the question asking if squid is being used and give the hostname of the server that squid is running on.  

%IMPORTANT% If you indicate that squid is running on the localhost, squid will need to be installed using the instructions above, otherwise =configure-osg.sh= will not be complete the configuration of the system.
