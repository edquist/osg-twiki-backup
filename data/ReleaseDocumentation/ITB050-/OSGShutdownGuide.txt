---++CE Shutdown Guide
%EDITTHIS%

In VDT 1.6.1 and later, all services (=/etc/init.d=, =/etc/xinetd.d=, =cron=) should be turned on/off using the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control= script.  This section will provide just a general overview. There is a <i>man</i> page available for the script, just type =man vdt-control=. You can also [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/man/vdt-control.html read the man page online]]
In VDT 1.6.1 and later, all services (<i>/etc/init.d, /etc/xinetd.d, cron</i>) should be turned on/off using the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control</i> script.  This section will provide just a general overview. There is a <i>man</i> page available for the script, just type "man vdt-control". You can also [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/man/vdt-control.html read the man page online]]

To view all services controlled by <i>vdt-control</i>:
<pre>
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt; vdt-control --list
<b>.... output from a fully enabled installation ... </b>
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
gris               | init   | do not enable
globus-gatekeeper  | inetd  | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
globus-ws          | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron     | cron   | enable
MLD                | init   | enable
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-5           | init   | enable
condor             | init   | enable
gratia-condor      | cron   | enable
</pre>

To shutdown <b>all</b> services:
<pre>
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt; vdt-control --off
</pre>

To shutdown <b>individual</b> services:
<pre>
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt; vdt-control --off  Service
</pre>

---+++/etc/xinetd.d services
For <i>/etc/xinetd.d</i> services, the script will be removed from the directory.  The <i>xinetd.d</i> daemon will be restarted.

---+++/etc/init.d services
For <i>/etc/init.d</i> services, the script will be removed from the directory and the service will be stopped.

---+++crontabs
For <i>root</i> cron entries, the entry will be removed from the crontab.

---+++ VDT 1.6.0 and earlier

Earlier versions of the VDT did not contain the ==vdt-control== script.  For these earlier versions of the VDT, it is necessary to stop the services by manually running the ==/etc/init.d== control scripts.  Some or all of the following will need to be run depending on what was installed on the system:

<verbatim>
# service tomcat-5 stop
# service apache stop
# service MLD stop
# service mysql stop
# service edg-crl-upgraded stop
# service gris stop
# service bdii stop
# service globus-ws stop
</verbatim>

==/etc/xinetd.d== services can be disabled by either removing the service configuration from the ==/etc/xinetd.d== direcotry, or setting ==disable=yes== in the service's ==/etc/xinetd.d== configuration file and restarting xinetd.
an OSG 0.4.1 Installation please note also the old [[ReleaseDocumentation.OSGShutdownGuide][OSG 0.4.1 Shutdown Guide]]
---+++Additional considerations

---++++<nop>MySql / <nop>Integration.MonALISA / Globus web services
Bear in mind that <nop>Integration.MonALISA also uses a database backend.  Here is how to find out whether [[MonALISA][Integration.MonALISA]] is running, and if so, under what user: If you are using OSG 0.4.1 or higher, <nop>Integration.MonALISA is most likely using the postgres database.  

If you have installed/activated Globus web services (<i>/etc/init.d/globus-ws</i>), it will be using a <i>MySql</i> database as it's persistent storage for the current state of the services.
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww | grep -i monalisa
</pre>
and for the mysql or postgres daemons associated with !Integration.MonALISA, check using:
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww | grep -i mysql
       or
&gt;  ps -efwww  | grep -i post[master,gres]
</pre>

If you are running a Rocks cluster, be sure to kill only the OSG-related mysql processes and avoid inadvertently stopping any cluster-related ones.  In general, pay attention if you need to kill any database-related processes explicitly; for example, look to make sure they are related to !Integration.MonALISA or Globus web services,  and/or are running out of your VDT installation area before stopping them.

If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you shouldr emove the <i>/etc/init.d/MLD</i> link if it exists, as this will link to the <i>ML_SER</i> in your old <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i>.

Also check to see whether there are any stray OSG-related processes, such as run-mis-ci.sh, globus-job-manager, and so forth still running, and kill them manually if necessary.  


<pre>
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/tomcat-5 stop
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/apache stop
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/mysql stop
</pre>
