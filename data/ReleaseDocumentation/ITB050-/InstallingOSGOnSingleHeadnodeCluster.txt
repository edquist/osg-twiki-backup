---+ Installing OSG on a Single Headnode Cluster
%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

You have a cluster with a batch system, and you want to add a single OSG headnode to it that instantiates a CE and SE on one piece of hardware in the simplest possible way. We do not suggest this as a production installation as it couples CE and SE and thus does not provide a very reliable OSG site.

Complete the instructions for [[InstallingCompleteOSGSiteOnSingleComputer][Installing OSG on a Single Computer]].

Mount the file systems mentioned on the single headnode as follows:
| =/osg/grid= | read/write |
| =/osg/wngrid= | read/write |
| =/osg/app= | read/write |
| =/osg/data= | read/write |
| =/osg/users= | read/write |
| =/osg/wntmp= | read/write |

Make sure that the following file systems are read/write accessible via the gridftp server:
   * =/osg/app=
   * =/osg/data=

Mount the file systems mentioned on all worker nodes on the cluster as follows:
| =/osg/wngrid= | read only |
| =/osg/app= | read only |
| =/osg/data= | read/write |
| =/osg/users= | read/write |
| =/osg/wntmp= | read/write |

In this configuration, WN_TMP (/osg/wntmp) is not a shared file system. It should be local to each and every worker node. In fact, it could be local to each and every batch slot.


---++ OSG Compliance
This installation implements the GridThreeModel and is thus OSG compliant. However, we do not suggest this configuration unless the cluster is quite small.
