---+ Installing OSG on a Single Headnode Cluster
%STARTINCLUDE%
You have a cluster with a batch system, and you want to add a single OSG headnode to it that instantiates a CE and SE on one piece of hardware in the simplest possible way. We do not suggest this as a production installation as it couples CE and SE and thus does not provide a very reliable OSG site.

<ol>
  <li>Complete the instructions for [[InstallingCompleteOSGSiteOnSingleComputer][Installing OSG on a Single Computer]].</li>
  <li> Mount the file systems mentioned on the single headnode as follows:
| _/osg/grid_ |  read/write |
| _/osg/wngrid_ :  read/write |
| _/osg/app_ | read/write |
| _/osg/data_ | read/write |
| _/osg/users_ | read/write |
| _/osg/wntmp_ | read/write |
  </li>
  <li> Make sure that the following file systems are read/write accessible via the gridftp server:
      * /osg/app
      * /osg/data
  </li>
  <li> Mount the file systems mentioned on all worker nodes on the cluster as follows:
| _/osg/wngrid_ | read only |
| _/osg/app_ | read only |
| _/osg/data_ | read/write |
| _/osg/users_ | read/write |
| _/osg/wntmp_ | read/write |
  </li>
</ol>

In this configuration, WN_TMP (/osg/wntmp) is not a shared file system. It should be local to each and every worker node. In fact, it could be local to each and every batch slot.


---++ OSG Compliance
This installation implements the [[LocalStorageRequirements#Grid3Model][Grid3 Model configuration]] and is thus OSG compliant. However, we do not suggest this configuration unless the cluster is quite small.
