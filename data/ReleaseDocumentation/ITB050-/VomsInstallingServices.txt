The VDT is unable to recognize your platform.  This version of the VDT is
supported on several Linux releases:

    RedHat 7 x86
    RedHat 9 x86
    RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 AS x86, x86-64 and ia64
    RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 AS x86

    Debian 3.1 x86
    ROCKS 3.3 x86 
    Fermi Scientific Linux 3.0 x86
    SuSE Linux 9 ia64

The VDT may work on other platforms, but it's not guaranteed.  If you
encounter problems and send mail to the VDT team for support please mention 
that you are installing the VDT on an unsupported platform.

VDT 1.6.1 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.6.1

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] <b>y</b>

If you would like, we can configure VOMS to start automatically
at boot time.

Configuring the VOMS daemon requires
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMS server to run automatically?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.
 
   <b>y</b>
    :   -----------------------------------------------------
    :
Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.

   <b>y</b>
   :   -----------------------------------------------------   
   :
Do you want to run a cron job that will upate the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Do you want to update the CA certification revocation lists (CRLs) automatically? [y/n]
<b>y</b>
   :   -----------------------------------------------------   
   :
The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b>r</b>
   :   -----------------------------------------------------   
    :
Downloading [voms-server-1.6.16.10-x86_rhas_3.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software//voms/1.6.16.10-1]...
</pre>

The above line should be the last line of output you see.  The version number of the tarball may be different than that shown above.  Do not be concerned with this.


---+++Verify the  installation completed successfully
To verify  the pacman installation was successful, there should be a setup.(c)sh in the VDT_LOCATION.   If present, source it.

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>source setup.sh</b>
</pre>

%IMPORTANT% This does not necessarily indicated that everything was installed and configured successfully.  It just verifies that the pacman installation completed successfully.  There is a lot of other magic that occurs during the process that should be validated.
