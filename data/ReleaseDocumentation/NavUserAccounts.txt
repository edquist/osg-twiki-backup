---+!! Grid User Accounts
%TOC%

%ICON{"hand"}% The %LINK_OSG% provides access to [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsComputeElement][compute]] and [[Documentation/GlossaryS#DefsStorageElement][storage]] resources using [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509][X509]] [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificates]] which are part of a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure][Public Key Infrastructure]]. Grid User Certificates are just another form of authorization and are as easy to use as passwords or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_public_key][ssh keys]]. The technical details and the implementation of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure][Public Key Infrastructure]] do not need to be a concern to the grid user.

Each [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][Grid User Certificate]] is associated with a %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN%; a unique string containing the full name of the grid user for identification. This _DN_ is used by resource providers to map grid users to local Unix accounts on the compute and storage resources.
