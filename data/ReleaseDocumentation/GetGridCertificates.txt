---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators. After reading this document you should be able to apply for and install a grid certificate on a grid resource. This document does not explain how to apply for a grid user certificate. To apply for a grid user certificate click [[UserCertificate][here]] instead!

---+ Requirements 

We recommend to read background information on grid certificates which can be found [[Documentation.CertificateWhatIs][here]]. In order to proceed you will also need:

   * a [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] installation
   * the *fully qualified domain* name of the host you need a grid certificate for
   * the *purpose* of the certificate that explains your request to the Certificate Authority
   * the full *name of the administrator* responsible for the host
   * the *e-mail address of the administrator*
   * the *telephone number of the administrator*
   * the name of the *Certificate Authority* your project is affiliated with
   * the name of the *Virtual Organization* affiliated with the Certificate Authority


%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%

%GRAY%This all doesn't belong into an introduction%ENDCOLOR%

%NOTE% For security reasons, please *do not* use clones of your host certificate for additional certificates even though it's technically possible.  There is one exception to this.  If you enable Globus web services, the Globus container requires  the host certificate.  Since the Globus container runs as _non_root_, the VDT configuration software will clone your host certificate as =/etc/grid-security/containercert.pem(containerkey.pem)= and will be owned by the account you configured Globus to run under (normally _globus_ or _daemon_). This is the *ONLY* exception at this time.

%NOTE% If you find the http certificate files already installed, you might want to check their end date which indicates their validity. As root, run the =openssl= command on each of the =*cert.pem= files, e.g.,:
<pre class="screen">
    # openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -enddate -noout
</pre>

%ENDTWISTY%

---+ Install the Certificate Scripts Package

To ease the process of applying for a grid host certificate the OSG provides a *Certificates Script Package*. [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] is required for the installation. Please install Pacman before you proceed.

First create a new directory where the certificates will be installed and change to it:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se]# mkdir /opt/csp
[root@osg-se]# cd /opt/csp
</pre>

Next use Pacman to install the Certificates Script Package:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:PPDG-Cert-Scripts
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:PPDG-Cert-Scripts

Do you want to add [%VDT_CACHE_URL%] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): yall
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check... 

The VDT installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

    http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n]
y
All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                                        
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

If you agreed to add =%VDT_CACHE_URL%= to the list of trusted caches and to the license, you should see the directory populated. 

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%

%GRAY%The old stuff ...%ENDCOLOR%

The [[CertScripts][Certificate Scripts Package]] provides scripts to request and retrieve certificates (see also [[Security.CertScriptsPackage][PPDG-Cert-Scripts]]).  Any recent OSG or VDT installation has them.  You can install the package stand-alone if that is convenient, using [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]].

   * Note: It possible to request host certificates for any host using a VDT/OSG install on any other computer.
  
*Installation of the cert-scripts package:* Make the directory where you are going to install the package, and =cd= to it.  Note that this will be the =$VDT_LOCATION=
for this temporarily installation of the certificate scripts.  The installation can be done as a regular user or as root. Find the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html][latest VDT cache]], and download =PPDG-Cert-Scripts= from it (shown for VDT %OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%), and answer the installation questions as shown below:

<pre class="screen">
# <b>mkdir tmp-cert-scripts</b>
# <b> cd tmp-cert-scripts</b>
# <b>pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/%VDT_CACHE%:PPDG-Cert-Scripts</b>
Do you want to add [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/%VDT_CACHE%] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>
Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] <b>y</b>
</pre>

%ENDTWISTY%

---+ Update your Environment

In order to use the Certificates Script Package you will need to update your environment:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# source setup.sh
</pre>

For *c/tc shell* change setup.sh to %RED%setup.csh%ENDCOLOR%. 

---+ Setup Initial Certificate Authority (CA) Package

Next we will use *vdt-ca-manage* to install the initial set of certificate authorities:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# vdt-ca-manage setupCA --location local --url osg

Setting CA Certificates for VDT installation at '/opt/csp'
Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

This command is used for the initial setup of the CA package. The option =--location local= is used to define a location below your current directory (/opt/csp/globus/share/certificates). Alternatively you can use =--location root= to install the certificates into their standard location (/etc/grid-security/certificates).

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
%GRAY%Not sure if that is needed%ENDCOLOR%
After you have completed installation of the CE or Client packages it is probably useful to
remove this temporary certificate scripts installation to avoid confusion with the
scripts included with the CE and Client packages.
%ENDTWISTY%

---+ Request a Host Certificate

Every resource or service contributing to the grid needs a certificate issued by one of the trusted *Certificate Authorities*. To proceed you will need following information at hand:

   * the *fully qualified domain* name of the host you need a grid certificate for
   * the *purpose* of the certificate that explains your request to the Certificate Authority
   * the full *name of the administrator* responsible for the host
   * the *e-mail address of the administrator*
   * the *telephone number of the administrator*
   * the name of the *Certificate Authority* your project is affiliated with
   * the name of the *Virtual Organization* affiliated with the Certificate Authority

Next we will use *cert-request* to generate a request which will be sent to the Certificate Authority you specified:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# cert-request -ou s -dir . -label osg-se.ligo.caltech.edu
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

At this point *cert-request* has created some files in the directory you specified and an e-mail has been sent to the Certificate Authority containing your request. The files will be needed again once you receive a reply from the Certificate Authority asking you to retrieve the certificate.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%

Every resource or service running on the grid needs an X509 identity certificate from one of the trusted CAs. 
   * Currently the [[http://www.doegrids.org][DOEGrids CA]] is the most common CA in use for OSG participants. 
   * The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra][OSG Registration Authority]] with DOEGrids handles most certificate requests for OSG participants. 
 
%NOTE% Do not use a host's DNS alias when requesting a host certificate. Use the authoritative DNS name. Failing to do so can cause GSS authentication failures similar to the following when a user tries to authenticate to the host after your certificate is installed:

<pre>
GSS authentication failure 
GSS Major Status: General failure 
GSS Minor Status Error Chain: 
accept_sec_context.c:gss_accept_sec_context:403: 
Error during delegation: Delegation protocol violation 
Failure: GSS failed Major:000d0000 Minor:00000001 Token:00000000 
</pre>

Run the =cert-request= script  to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.
$VDT_LOCATION must point to the package in which the scripts exist, e.g., the CE install directory or where you installed PPDG-Cert-Scripts,
or the temporary directory as described above.  The values for the =-label= and =-dir= options need to match the values used later with the =cert-retrieve= script.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source  ./setup.sh</b>

%ENDTWISTY%

---+ Retrieve and Install the Host Certificate

Once the certificate has been approved by the Certificate Authority you will receive an e-mail which includes the *serial number* in the format *0xYYYY*. The serial number will be needed to retrieve the certificate. 

To retrieve the new certificate change to the installation directory of the Certificate Scripts Package and update your environment:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# cd /opt/csp
[root@osg-se csp]# source setup.sh 
</pre>

For *c/tc shell* change setup.sh to %RED%setup.csh%ENDCOLOR%. Next we will use the %RED%serial number%ENDCOLOR% of the certificate and the previous values for =--label= and =--dir= to retrieve the certificate executing *cert-retrieve*:

<pre class="screen">
[root@osg-se csp]# cert-retrieve  -serial %RED%0xYYYY%ENDCOLOR% -label %RED%osg-se.ligo.caltech.edu%ENDCOLOR% -dir %RED%.%ENDCOLOR% -prefix %RED%osg-se.ligo.caltech.edu%ENDCOLOR%

The certificate consists of two files (osg-se.ligo.caltech.educert.pem and osg-se.ligo.caltech.edukey.pem) which have been placed into the current directory. Note, If you did not use the =-prefix= option the default value =user= will be used and the resulting certificate will consist of the two files (usercert.pem and userkey.pem).

%ICON{warning}% Please note that these files represent a %RED%public%ENDCOLOR% and a %RED%private%ENDCOLOR% and should be treated accordingly!

Finally we will install the certificate in the default location */etc/grid-security/*:

<pre class="screen">

---+ Verify the Host Certificate

The following command will verify that the certificate is readable. The output shown will be similar, but specific to your request:

Note the %RED%Validity%ENDCOLOR% in the output above which contains the start and end date for your certificate. Once the certificate is about to expire you will receive an e-mail from the Certificate Authority asking you to renew it.

+---+ Other service certificates 

Additional service certificate can be obtained using the same procedure as for the host certificate above by
simply including the =-service servicename= option with cert-request.  For =servicename= you might use =http=.  
The name of the service is rather arbitrary.
<pre class="screen">
> cert-request -ou s -service http -host my-computer.some.domain -label http-my-computer
</pre>

Get an HTTP service certificate to activate CEMon

%BLUE%[D.O. - Seems to me that the CEMon install/configure documentation should describe what certificate
it needs rather than putting that here.%ENDCOLOR%

See the CEMon section for the details on activating this service.  You will need the http certificate available before you activate this service.  <i>CEMon</i> runs as a  <i>tomcat</i> service and therefore the HTTP certicate must be owned by the uid under which tomcat and apache run.   (If you installed as <i>root</i>, the default user  for tomcat/apache is <i>daemon</i>).

<pre class="screen">
&gt;  <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt;  <b>cert-request -ou s</b> 
                -dir . \
                -host <i>my-host.some.domain</i> \
                -service http \
                -label <i>my-host-http</i>
</pre>
And after receiving an email notice that the certificate was issued, retrieve it as

<pre class="screen">
> <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
> <b>cert-retrieve -serial 0xNNNN -label <i>my-host-http</i> -prefix http -dir .</b>
</pre>

Follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating =httpkey.pem= and =httpcert.pem=.  This certificate should be should be located in the following directory with ownership and permissions as follows:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir /etc/grid-security/http </b>
$ <b>mv ./httpcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>mv ./httpkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chown -R daemon.daemon /etc/grid-security/http </b>
</pre>
