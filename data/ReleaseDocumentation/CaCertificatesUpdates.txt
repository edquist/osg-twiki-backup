Is it really worth having a separate document page with just the additional information included above rather than just including that in the initial CaCertificatesUpdatesConfig page?

For all other installations, the following steps  should be performed (you must be _root_ user to use the _vdt-control_ script):
   1 For the _vdt-update-certs_ service:
      * vdt-control --enable vdt-update-certs
      * vdt-control --on vdt-update-certs
   1 For the _fetch_crl_ service (this will activate the service and retrieve an initial set of CRLs)
      * vdt-control --enable fetch-crl
      * vdt-control --on fetch-crl
      * $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage fetchCRL

A complete documentation of vdt-ca-manage command can be found in the [[VDTCAManage][vdt-ca-manage documentation]]
