---++Overview

While one might choose the kind of data movement that best fits the processing, it is also desirable that the processing be designed to facilitate efficient use of storage resources. In addition, the data movement portion of the computational model may depend on other factors, such as the capabilities of co-located Compute Elements and the needs of other projects acting on the same data.

DAGMan(Directed Acyclic Graph Manager) is job management software. It cannot work directly with Storage Resource Managers, but does has the ability to stage files into a job, stage files out of a job, and move files between compute resources via Condor processes.

DAGMan submits jobs to Condor in an order represented by a DAG and processes the results. An input file defined prior to submission describes the DAG, and a Condor submit description file for each program in the DAG is used by Condor. Each node (program) in the DAG needs its own Condor submit description file. Nodes may specify data movement. As DAGMan submits jobs to Condor, it uses a single Condor log file to enforce the ordering required for the DAG.  The DAG itself is defined by the contents of a DAGMan input file. DAGMan is responsible for scheduling, recovery, and reporting for the set of programs submitted to Condor. DAGMan can also be used in conjunction with the Pegasus Workflow Management System, which provides a resource-independent interface and management technologies that map the workflow specification onto Condor pools, campus clusters and other cyberinfrastrure resources.
