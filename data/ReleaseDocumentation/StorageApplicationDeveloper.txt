---++Storage for the Application Developer

---+++Overview

While one might choose the kind of data movement that best fits the processing, it is also desirable that the processing be designed to facilitate efficient use of storage resources. In addition, the data movement portion of the computational model may depend on other factors, such as the capabilities of co-located Compute Elements and the needs of other projects acting on the same data.
