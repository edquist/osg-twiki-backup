---++ User Debugging Introduction
This page will cover three things:
   * Simple certificate management
   * Connecting to and using a CE.
   * Transferring files to and from the CE.

Each part demonstrates a different capability, with the latter two interacting with an external site.  If you don't have a CE to test against, please use the [[FindAvailableResource][guide for finding resources]] to find a CE that supports your VO.  The document below uses osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu as the example CE.

The rest of this page is very thorough and includes how to verify the CE portion is working - you may safely ignore this if you aren't the CE's administrator.

---++ Conclusion
This page taught you very simple tools:
   * =grid-proxy-init=: Creates a short-lived credential which can be used to run jobs.
   * =globus-job-run=: Runs a single execution of a command on the remote host (or its batch system).
   * =globus-url-copy=: Copies a single file from your host to the CE, or vice-versa.
If you wanted to run 100,000 jobs, it would be incredibly tedious to build your applications around these tools.  Instead you want a higher-level tool focused on job-management.

Do not use these tools on a large scale, as these will cause the remote site to crash and possible get your account banned - Condor-G will work much better.

Regardless of what job management you are using, we feel understanding the basic building blocks of the grid is essential for debugging when things go wrong.
