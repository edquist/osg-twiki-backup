%ICON{hand}% This document is for grid users. Simple tests will be introduced which may help testing the correct authentication with and operation of grid resources. This document also provides a _step-by-step guide_ to determine the approximate cause of an error.

---+ Introduction

Using a grid resource involves a series of steps that differ from the steps taken on a Unix resource. The following sections introduce and demonstrate each step required to run a basic grid job submission scenario. By understanding these simple tests you will be well prepared to understand, operate and debug complex grid scenarios. The series of tests are:

   1 [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_Test][Authentication Test]]: create and verify your grid proxy used to authenticate yourself with a grid resource
   1 [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Data_Transfer_Test][Data Transfer Test]]: copy data to and from a grid resource
   1 [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Job_Submission_Test][Job Submission Test]]: execute a program on a grid resource

%NOTE% The *Data Transfer Test* and the *Job Submission Test* depend on the successful completion of the *Authentication Test*. Both tests are independent of each other for the purpose of this document and require access to a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, which is the terminology used in the OSG to describe a grid resource that can run jobs. 

---+ Requirements

   1 access to a resource that has [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][Globus client tools]] installed
   1 a [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateWhatIs][grid user certificate]] installed on the same resource in =$HOME/.globus=
   1 access to a potential test resource ( see next paragraph )

---+ Choose a Test Resource

%ICON{hand}% Except for the [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_Test][Authentication Test]] all tests require a grid resource to test against. Consider [[Documentation.FindAvailableResource][this guide]] for choosing an OSG grid resource to run the tests. Make sure to know what your membership %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO% is and that the grid resource you choose supports this VO! This document uses =osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu= as an example which should not be used to run your tests!
