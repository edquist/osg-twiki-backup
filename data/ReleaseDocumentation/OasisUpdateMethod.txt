---+!! Updating Software on OASIS

%TOC%


The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version 3.1.13* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher)


---++ High Level Overview
To update software on Oasis, you must:

   * login to oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org with =gsissh=
   * Install or update software in the =/net/nas01/Public/ouser.$VO= directory.
   * execute osg-oasis-update

In order to be authorized to use OASIS, you must:
   * Be part of an OSG VO and be [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][registered in OIM as one of the VO managers]].
   * File a [[http://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][GOC ticket]] requesting your VO have access to the OASIS service.  To meet security requirements, we whitelist the DNs who can use your VO's account; you must list any VO software manager who will need access (and each individual needs to be registered in OIM).

Once your VO has been enabled, any of the VO's OASIS software managers may login and update your VO's software at any time.

---++ Technical details


---+++ Logging in
A VO manager, regstered in OIM, logs into =oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org= with =gsissh=.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%VO%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% gsissh oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org
</pre>

By logging in, he is authenticated and authorized to initiate an update.


---+++ Updating and installing software.
Content is added/modified/removed on a staging area here at =/net/nas01/Public/ouser.$VO= where $VO is the name of the VO represented by the manager.

Files here are visible to both =oasis-login= and the Stratum 0 server (oasis.opensciencegrid.org)

The VO manager requests an oasis update with: 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% osg-oasis-update
</pre>

It is required that the requester be logged into the account associated
with a supported VO. As of this writing, these are:
   * ouser.csiu,
   * ouser.gm2,
   * ouser.hcc,
   * ouser.icecube,
   * ouser.mis,
   * ouser.nova,
   * ouser.osg
   * ouser.sbgrid,
   * ouser.uc3.

Others may be added per request.
Any other account generates a message and the update request fails.

Only one instance of =osg-oasis-update= can run at a time (across all VOs); your request may be queued behind a different VO.  If you encounter severe delays (more than 4 hours), please file a GOC ticket.

---+++ Details of =osg-oasis-update= operation.

A test is performed to determine if an update is in progress (existence
of a lock file, discussed below). If an update is in progress a "Please
try again later" message is printed and the process exits.

If no lock file exists one (vo_update_requested) is written. 

A request to update the stratum 0 generated.

The stratum 0 update is run as root and started by a crontab entry running
once per minute. The cron job detects the lockfile (vo_update_requested) written by the request
process on oasis-login.
If another lock (oasis_update_in_progress)
exists, the process sleeps and loops until it does not. This
mechanism prevents more than one update to be in progress at any time.
If oasis_update_in_progress does not exist it is created and the update process continues.
The files previously placed on the shared filesystem are rsync'ed to the 
/cvmfs directory. Upon completion a cvmfs-sync and cvmfs_server publish
are executed. All lock files are removed upon completion.

Finally, the status of the service is updated. See
http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org/stamp
A publish_age of zero indicates success. 

These mechanisms insure that:

   1. Only the VO manager can write to a location serving as the source of updates
   1. After a request is made only the files associated with one VO are updated
   1. Only one update can be in progress at a time
