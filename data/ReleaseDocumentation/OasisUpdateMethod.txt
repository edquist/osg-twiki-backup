---+++ How to initiate an update
   * login to oasis-login.grid.iu.edu
   * execute /usr/local/oasis-login/bin/vo_update

---+++ Technical details

A VO manager, regstered in OIM, logs into oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org.
By logging in, he is authenticated and authorized to initiate an update.

Content is added/modified/removed on a staging area here:
/net/nas01/Public/ouser.$VO
where $VO is the name of the VO represented by the manager.
Files here are visible to both oasis-login and the stratum 0 server (oasis.opensciencegrid.org)

The VO manager requests an oasis update with:

/usr/local/oasis-login/bin/vo_update

It is required that the requester be logged into the account associated
with a supported VO. Currently, these are ouser.hcc, ouser.csiu, ouser.nova, ouser.gm2 and 
ouser.mis. Any other account generates a message and the update request fails.

A test is performed to determine if an update is in progress (existence
a a lock file, discussed below). If an update is in progress a "Please
try again later" message is printed and the process exits.

If no lock file exists one (vo_update_requested) is written. 

A request to update the stratum 0 generated.

The stratum 0 update is run as root and started by a crontab entry running
once per minute. The cron job detects the lockfile (vo_update_requested) written by the request
process on oasis-login.
If another lock (oasis_update_in_progress)
exists, the process sleeps and loops until it does not. This
mechanism prevents more than one update to be in progress at any time.
If oasis_update_in_progress does not exist it is created and the update process continues.
The files previously placed on the shared filesystem are rsync'ed to the 
/cvmfs directory. Upon completion a cvmfs-sync and cvmfs_server publish
are executed. All lock files are removed upon completion.

Finally, the status of the service is updated. See
http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org/stamp
A publish_age of zero indicates success. 

These mechanisms insure that:

   1. Only the VO manager can write to a location serving as the source of updates
   1. After a request is made only the files associated with one VO are updated
   1. Only one update can be in progress at a time
