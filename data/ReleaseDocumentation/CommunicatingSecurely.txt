---++ Communicate Securely - working familiarity with X.509 (SSL) and PGP (!GnuPG)

There is a [[Documentation.OsgFaq#Security_and_Certificates][FAQ on Security and Certificates]] that answers several questions about using certificates in the OSG.  In particular, note the question "My web browser does not trust the DOEGrids CA?" and the answer at the bottom of that page.  Web browsers are putting up more informative (scarier?) messages these days when you try to access a web site that uses an SSL certificate from a CA which is not trusted by your browser.  Most of the grid CAs, including the DOEGrids CA used extensively by OSG, are not automatically trusted in your web browser.  It is helpful to follow the instructions in the FAQ answer and install the ESnet Root CA & DOEGrids CA certificates into your browser from the trusted repository https://www.tacar.org/repos.

In addition to trusting server certificates, there are uses for having your personal certificate (and private key) installed in your web browser so it can be used to authenticate to web sites, such as [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/home][OIM]] mentioned above.  If you need a personal certificate you can follow the [[Documentation.CertificateGet][instructions at this link]].
