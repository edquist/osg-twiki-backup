---+!! Site Responsibilities for Security
%TOC%

This describes the expectations and actions that a site administrator handles regarding security issues
as a participant in OSG.

---++ Background
It is expected that the administrative and security contacts for a resource registered with OSG (in OIM)
are capable of dealing with the normal system administration and security practices of running
a cluster of machines for scientific computing.  The security materials provided on the OSG twiki
occasionally mention examples of how basic computer security features could be handled
but that is not a replacement for for formal in-depth training on unix system administration.
We have collected some examples in a Security.BestPractices page (which you are welcome to contribute to).

---++ Site Registration
This is normally a one time occurrence and is handled by filling out the registration form
at the [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Grid Operations Center]] and attending one of the
[[Operations.ProductionMeetingMinutes][weekly Operations meetings]] to introduce yourself and your site.

It is important to provide accurate and reliable contact information with the registration.
At large sites with active involvement with OSG the operations and security contacts for a site
are likely different people (or groups). At some small sites it is likely that the operations contact
and the security contact are the same person.  The important aspect of the security contact
is to be someone who will read and understand the security notices from OSG.
If the professional computer & network security staff at your site need to be reminded of
what OSG is every time you ask them something then the security contact for OSG should be
the person responsible for the general system administration of the grid resource.

 
---++ Maintenance of Contact Info in OIM
---++ Read Security Notifications from OSG

---++ Maintain up-to-date Trusted CA information
---++ Maintain up-to-date VO and user access information
---++ Respond to requests from the OSG Security Officer
---++ Communicate Securely - working familiarity with X.509 (SSL, S/MIME) and PGP (!GnuPG)
---++ Search log files
