---+++ Document Tester Responsibilities
%EDITTHIS%
%BR%
Each installation or procedure document in the OSG Documentation TWiki should be tested. The purpose of the test is to check if the documented procedures yield expected results when carried out. A document needs to be tested:
   1. After it has been created.
   1. After major changes to the document have been made.
   1. Before major releases.%BR%
The Tester (often the Document Owner) should preferably be a person that is not:
   1. The developer of the software or procedure described in the document.
   1. The owner of the document in case 3. above.%BR%
The Tester of a document should only have a general knowledge about the topic of the document. To follow the instructions of the document, the tester must have access to facilities needed for the test (ITB-Site). The Tester is responsible for:
   1. Testing the instructions on the software and version the document is meant to be used with and noting any problems or anomalies 
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner of the document to resolve issues from a test of procedures
   1. Doing a final test (if necessary) after the issues are resolved to verify the procedure presented the document can be performed successfully
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Tester
%NOTE%  The roles of the Reviewer and Tester are different!  The Reviewer is only responsible to check documents for their readability, logical structure, and conformance to standards, while the Tester must apply the procedures as described in the document.
