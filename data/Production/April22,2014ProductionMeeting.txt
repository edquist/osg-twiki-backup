!GlueX is continuing their Data Challenge #2; so far they have used 3.9M hours since the beginning of April and they estimate to need another 1.5M hours to finish their work.  They ran into SHA-1 and SHA-2 issues with their dCache and have had to temporarily halt production while they upgrade their dCache software to enable storage of output results from production.

We are re-engaging with Purdue to find out how to get more effective production at that site; continue to see a very large percentage of pilot failures.
