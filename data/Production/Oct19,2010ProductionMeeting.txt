---+++ CDF 

Eric Wicklund said that people are trying to the KISTI site, but jobs are failing. Chander will follow up with Stephan Lammel to find out how big of a priority this is. 

---+++ DO

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9142][Ticket #9142]]: D0 has removed the !UConn SE from configuration because 100% jobs are failing. Richard Jones and Joel Snow will do further testing after Joel is back from vacation. (Richard said SAM obscures meaningful data in log files, so he will send to Joel.)


---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9362][Ticket #9362]]: When small clusters of jobs (~200) were submitted to the the UConn SE, they went through fine, but when clusters increased, Richard started seeing access failures. Dan will discuss who should work this ticket

Production: Richard is looking for a site discovery tool to find out what software is installed. Dan will initiate discussion between Richard and Igor Sfiligoi regarding pilot jobs.

Ports are now open at Jefferson Lab, so glideins will be able to be launched within the firewall.
