   * (to be updated after the meeting) John, Chris, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 8~10K running jobs, mainly MC jobs. Starting this weekend, we run out of real jobs, so number of running jobs/pilots drops a lot. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 81%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 600K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 84K jobs per day
         * failed 64K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 90%,  walltime - 96%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * USATLAS sites are asked to finish the upgrade to SL5 and OSG 1.2 by the end of January. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  no update this week. 

---++ LIGO (Britta, Rob E.)

 * Gratia reports:
   * Current week's total usage: 5 users utilized 38 sites
      * 74974 jobs total (51987 / 22987 = 69.3% success)
      * 640336.3 wall clock hours total (593458.9 / 46877.4 = 92.7% success)
   *  Last week's total usage: 5 users utilized 37 sites
      * 39869 jobs total (34898 / 4971 = 87.5% success)
      * 395944.0 wall clock hours total (383453.0 / 12490.9 = 96.8% success)

   * E@H reports
      * last day: 
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC):  992k,  Last week: 470k
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 3 (+1)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 10 (+1)
 
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Last week's availability metrics
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yek7kob][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]] - NOTE: High Level OSG Display added to monitoring per Brian Bockelman's request, SLA expected soon.
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ybp3w7z][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * Relevant to only WLCG Interop sites: SAM team indicated a couple more instances of a broker problem.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/01/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-26th.html][Production release Tuesday - Jan 26th 14:00 UTC]]*
      * MyOSG 1.14, Ticket 1.13, OIM 2.13 
   * *GOC-FNAL ticket exchange*: A meeting was held this morning between the GOC and Fermilab/Fermigrid/CMS about progressing with testing on web service ticket exchange. A few technical hurdles need to be overcome before testing web services can continue. 
      * GOC will also attempt to setup prototype exchange with RT ticketing system, possibly development ATLAS ticket system
   * Next [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2871][Registration for OSG All-Hands meeting (March 8th - 11th @ FNAL) is now open]] - hope to see you all there!
   * vo package release for change in ordering requested by cdf and addition of grid unesp

---+++ Future Events
   * RSV Collector upgrade coming up in the next couple of weeks -- waiting for VDT to release change to their production cache; ITB collector already successfully upgraded to 1.06.14 last week.
   * Migration from error-prone email-based ticket exchange to new TicketExchanger (TX) based GOC-GGUS setup to likely be released to production on Feb 3rd assuming all tests are successful - GOC is working with GGUS to ensure smooth transition
