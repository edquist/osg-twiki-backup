   * General production status
      Production has not fully reloaded, ~5K running jobs now on all USATLAS sites. There are a lot of analysis jobs to run in the mean time. Next reprocessing will probably start end of the week. Only collision data will be reprocessed.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 900K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 132K jobs per day
         * failed 123K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 88%,  walltime - 93%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred >100 TB/day data last week, with peak at 175 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites, closing.
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  space is not a problem (1TB per site), but tech details (how to access and transfer data, how long data will stay) need to be worked out. Needs input from D0 experts, will be good to test run through the workflow. 
      * We had issue of not receiving GGUS alarms, figured out with GOC.  More tests are being done.

   * One month work-flow on LIGO ITB fails 
      * Due to reoccurring of dfuse memory leak
      * Waiting for green light from Robert
   * Would like to expand testing to other non-dcache sites

   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/oim-213-bug-patched.html][OIM 2.13 patched to fix bug with downtime editor]]
      * Chance for erroneous downtime data for downtimes that were set in recent weeks. 
         * This only applies to users who EDITED AN *EXISTING* DOWNTIME BETWEEN Jan 26th and Feb 5. If you added a downtime in that time frame but never tried to go back and edit it then this does *not* impact you. 
         * Between January 26th 14:00 (when version 2.13 of OIM was released) and Feb 5th 17:00 UTC, OIM had a bug that was causing users to not be able to update already set downtimes. What made this even worse is that while it failed to update the DB with new content a user provided, the web interface was actually showing the updated content thereby leading users to think all is well!
      * GOC opened ticket to contact (via ticket CC) users who possibly edited downtimes during this time frame: [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8077][https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8077]]

      * !MyOSG 1.15 -- https://myosg.grid.iu.edu; Toned down the history graph color; Added CSS styling to force IE rendering of history graphs to be more similar to other browsers; Re-factored XML comments and added link to MySQL URL Registration form; Changed wording on several SC related filters to make its purpose clear (Related ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7848); Added parameter for report bug link so that user can specify which URL is causing the issue; Fixed service name / description inconsistencies (that wasn't corrected in last week's changes); Updated XML schema files to be consistent with changes to the XML made in last week's and this week's release; Cosmetic adjustment / Banner Changed;
         * No service outages are expected but GOC reserves 1 hour for unforeseen problems.
      * GOC Ticket 1.14 -- https://ticket.grid.iu.edu; Added anchor feature to ticket viewer so users can share permalinks for each ticket update, and highlight to chosen ticket update; Fixed the CSS style for error note, h2, required fields, field descriptions and others; Added URL reference fields to OIM / !MyOSG / Ticket forms so that each application can pass the URL where the issues are occuring; Added background to selected description - to make it more conspicuous; Cosmetic adjustment / Banner Change; [Relevant to ticket editors]: Made displayed teams to be configurable on ticket editor.
         * No service outages are expected but GOC reserves 1 hour for unforeseen problems.
      * OIM 2.14  -- https://oim.grid.iu.edu; Changed wording on several SC related filters to make its purpose clear (Related ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7848); Added check for invalid user ID for User Edit form; Added URL reference to Report Bug link to be passed to ticket form; Cosmetic adjustment / Banner Change; [Relevant to GOC and management staff]: Removed annual review controller page;

         * The production RSV collector is expected to be down for two hours but the GOC reserves 8 hours for unforeseen problems - RSV records sent by site level clients will not be lost, and will be collected when the collector is brought back up.
   * *GOC-TX*
      * With USATLAS RT: Ongoing testing .. expect migration to new setup in a few weeks
      * With FNAL Remedy: Continue new web service based GOC-FNAL ticket exchange work - GOC waiting on FNAL system access
      * Are there any other ticketing systems doing exchhnge with GOC that would like to participate in development of module for that particular ticketing system with GOC-TX?
      * Once we have RT exchange module well tested, we will contact any other SCs using RT to move to new exchange system in place of email exchange.
   * *GOC Debian repo*: Continue final testing of Debian repository deployment for CA distribution (requested by LIGO VO), then announce release. Anand/Dave Dykstra making additional changes to ensure this works properly
