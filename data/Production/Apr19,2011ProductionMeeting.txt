-- Main.DanFraser - 08 Apr 2011
---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC collisions were back last week with improved luminosity. So far this year the integrated luminosity for ATLAS is ~60pb-1, about half of which was collected during the last week, after the collisions were back. More improvements on coming 2-3 weeks.
      * US ATLAS production was relatively stable at the average level of about 10k running jobs. Fast reprocessing of 2011 data is practically finished, and production is mainly simulation jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 87%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.1M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 162K jobs per day
         * failed 85K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 93%, walltime - 98%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300~350TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * HCC opportunistic use: HCC folks will join USATLAS facility meeting to discuss their use cases etc this week.

   * E@H rank based on RAC: 6 (-2)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * Data transfers:  1 week data (0.14 TB ) to LIGO_CIT: 65 hrs, Nebraska: 33 hrs, FF: 32 hrs, CIT_CMS_T2: 9 days
   * 1 week work-flow test runs:  LIGO_CIT: 37 hrs, Nebraska: 4 days, 19 hrs, 19 mins, FF: failed, CIT_CMS_T2: to be submitted 
   * trouble shooting failed 1 week work-flow at FF work-flow

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * running two large work-flows (>10000 jobs) via GlideinWMS on OSG (4 sites, pre staged data)


---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-12th.html][Release notes]]
   * All services moved outside IU institutional firewall.
      * The [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/NDT_perf.jpg][previous]] and [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/indy-after.jpg][current]] results.
      * This was in response to a recurring problem where a dramatic decrease in network performance was noticed around 1 AM.
      * No problems observed resulting from this change. Process count on BDII servers improved, stable.
   * Incorrect RSV failures were reported for some !GridFTP sites 9-12/Apr. Mechanism understood.
   * DOEGrid maintenance 13/Apr, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/doegrids-maintenance-notice-april-13.html][Maintenance notice]]
   * SAM data consumer was down 8-11/Apr. RSV reports have "Unknown" status on 10/Apr. Data has been resent.
   * is4 placed into DNS RR, no seg-faults observed, ~1/3 load taken as expected.
   * Rob, Scott and Soichi met with David Collados regarding RSV/SAM interoperability issues.
      * Gridview to be phased out (effects RSV/WLCG comparison reports) in favor of MyEGI
      * A small change in message format of message sent by GOC will allow removal of a component at SAM. 
      * Some messages have what seems to be a non-standard service type field, investigating. 
      * Will configure SAM endpoints for failover (4 possible endpoints, geographically distributed).
      * Full meeting minutes will be published soon. 
   *  WMS Glide In Factory
      * Has a special classad for glidein max available memory to facilitate large jobs

---+++ Operations This Week
   * No announced changes for this week.
   * RSV data to be corrected, work with SAM to propagate corrections.
   * Retiring an old non-production server
   * Gratia and !ReSS
      * looking to schedule rack and subnet moves
