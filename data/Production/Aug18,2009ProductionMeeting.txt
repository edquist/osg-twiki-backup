---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2009August10][Previous Meeting Minutes]]
   * No BDII Interruptions during the week of August 10th-16th

---+++ Operations This Week
   * pyOpenSSL issue causes problems with RSV records on resources that do not have pyOpenSSL on system by default. This causes the Gratia transfer mechanism used by RSV to fail. VDT is testing the fix in the ITB.
   * Another notification went out to update OIM contact information. If you have not yet done this, please do so. (366 Contacts, 240 not Confirmed)
   * We've been contacting site administrators to turn up RSV reporting on all resources. (Of 30 original tickets, 14 remain)
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled release August 28th.

---+++ Future Events
   * September Machine Room Move in Bloomington September 19 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG. This could be delayed until October 17th if it benefits anyone in the collaboration, the original date was picked with the idea of a October LCH turn up.

---+++ Test !MyOSG 1.6 Message

<verbatim>
OSG Integration, Gratia, and Metrics,

We are finishing up on MyOSG 1.6 and would like to do testing before  
releasing into production. Here is the change log.

* Added Resource Group pages. Left original Resource pages(/ 
wizardXXXX) for backward compatibility but removed it from the main  
menu. We will gradually phase out the Resource pages.
* Changed various inter-page links to point to the new resource group  
pages (instead of resource pages)
* Changed the way item selectors worked. Previously it was a big list  
of checkboxes. Now user can search the item by typing the name, or hit  
down key to show the entire list. Applied this selector to everywhere
that makes sense except the old resource page.
* Updated so that metric detail is now pulled directly from Gratia  
(MyOSG db is projected to reach its limit within the end of year, and  
this allows MyOSG db to scale beyond the horizon)
* Added "User contributed MyOSG view" section on the home page which  
pulls content from one of our Twiki pages.

The new release is available at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. I'd like to ask  
for your help testing the new changes to be sure they do not affect  
Accounting, Metrics, or other usage of the MyOSG site. One specific  
issue we'd like your feedback on is if you are pulling XML from MyOSG,  
please make sure that you test it against myosg-itb by modifying your  
URL from myosg.grid to myosg-itb.grid with the rest of the URL still  
in tact. Also, be sure to try our new Resource Group pages which is a  
rewrite of original Resource pages and uses correct OIM hierarchy.  
Eventually we should all be using Resource Group pages to create new  
MyOSG queries and XML URLs.

Barring any issues that would prevent release into production we are  
planning an August 28th release. Please contact us if you have any  
questions or find any issues with the MyOSG 1.6 update.

Thanks,
Rob
