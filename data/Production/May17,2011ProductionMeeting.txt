---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * no updates this week, waiting for Pulsar glidein dag issue to be resolved (see below)

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * Pulsar Powerflux jobs are submitted via glidein meachanism to four 'Powerflux sites': UFlorida_PG, UCSDT2, Nebraska (Red), LIGO_CIT
   * when dag submitted, for some reason, glidein requests are being made at non-Powerflux sites, e.g. Firefly, OUHEP_OSG
   * jobs start running and fail because the Powerflux data have not been pre-staged to any sites other than the four Powerflux sites mentioned above 
   * currently, we do not know why glidein requests are being made at non-Powerflux sites, Mats and I (Britta) are troubleshooting

---++ Security (Mine)
   * I am off for the afternoon. Here is the report from security team. 
   * Panda/Us-atlas security drill. 
      * We decided to go ahead with the security drill. We are working with Atlas management and Atlas sites to identify 4-5 production sites to participate in the drill. Only the identified sites will be expected to participate. The drill will start on May23rd and end by 28th. We will give more details to identified sites as to what we will expect from them and how they will be graded.
      * Jim Barlow will work with Operations team to inform them of the drill. We do not expect any major support from operations team. There are a few points such as operations should not respond to tickets we open for the drill. Jim will go over the dates and the details of the drill with Operations asap. 
   * The certificate migration work is stalled for another two weeks. In case anybody wonders, Anand will extend his vacation in India two more weeks. This work will resume when he comes back. 
   * Smaller issue (FYI). There has been a SSL renegotiation problem affecting DOEGrids web interface -- the SSL connection were breaking. Goc ticket #10249. We found another solution that could fix the problem form the server side. A ticket will be filed with ESnet service desk. If anyone else has the same problem, please refer them to GOC.
