---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 354,083.55763, Last Week: 217,482.27536
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 3 (+3)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * no updates this week, waiting for Pulsar glidein dag issue to be resolved (see below)

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * Pulsar Powerflux jobs are submitted via glidein meachanism to four 'Powerflux sites': UFlorida_PG, UCSDT2, Nebraska (Red), LIGO_CIT
   * when dag submitted, for some reason, glidein requests are being made at non-Powerflux sites, e.g. Firefly, OUHEP_OSG
   * jobs start running and fail because the Powerflux data have not been pre-staged to any sites other than the four Powerflux sites mentioned above 
   * currently, we do not know why glidein requests are being made at non-Powerflux sites, Mats and I (Britta) are troubleshooting
