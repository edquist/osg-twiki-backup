---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2010March1][Previous Meeting Agenda]]
   * Availability metrics for the last week 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ycdecwn][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]]
         * Small blip in BDII RSV Monitoring, the GOC will investigate. This outage was seen on the OSG BDII (2170) but not the WLCG BDII (2180), this looks to be a bug in the monitoring. 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/y96wtjb][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/03/vdt-web-site-downtime.html][VDT Web Site Downtime]] - resolve
   * *GOC Debian Repo* 
      * [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/apt/][Debian CA Distribution]] was declared to be under Production status.
      * [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/][Installation/Update Instructions here]].
   * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7656][UNM Follow Up]] 
      * Rob talked to Dan Felker, there are some changes at UNM that may take a few weeks. Rob will call back then. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Upcoming ITB release*: see notification/blog for more details today; ITB release will be on March 23rd.
   * *Trouble Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * GGUS - Running Smoothly
      * BNL RT
         * Implementation Plan Being Reviewed
         * [[http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AQGl_1gJKDWDZGY5ZnR6anZfMjFmMmpzZmc1cA&hl=en#Transition_from_email_based_ex_7272405605382354][GOC-TX  section with detailed transition proposal]]
         * BNL requested addition of priority mapping - done on dev instance
      * FNAL Remedy - Initial Connections Issues Resolved, Moving Forward 
   * New VO Package later this week with HCC for ITB testing

---++ Engage (Mats, John, Chris)


14 users utilized 39 sites;

19964 jobs total (15628 / 4336 = 78.3% success);

92163.0 wall clock hours total (72294.3 / 19868.6 = 78.4% success);

No production issues.

---++ Integration (Suchandra)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)
  
   * D0 
      * MC Production ramped up further. Average 9.8 M Events/week; 115,000 wall-hours/day at 80% efficiency. 
      * D0-internal problems: disk space filled up in in submission infrastructure.

   * GLUE-X
      * Site:side: Abhishek facilitating other VOs to use GLUE-X site in production. GLUE-X site now in use by Engage, GEANT4, GPN, LIGO, SBGrid, GLOW.
      * VO-side: Next step for GLUE-X workflow management - need to decide on a scheme for job dispatch. Abhishek & Dan discussing options with Richard Jones.
      * Policy related feedback: Lack of OSG policy on POSIX account requirements; a site's support for multiple VOs; multiple sites' support for a specific VO.

   * SBGrid
      * VO-side: BNL team is setting up Panda submission infrastructure for SBGrid operations.
      * Site-side: SBGrid local site upgraded to OSG v1.2; no known issues.

   * HCC
      * David Swanson conveyed that team is currently deploying VOMS server.
   * !CompBioGrid 
      * Site-side: Local site running at full capacity; continuing to provide cycles for Engage and SBGrid.
      
   * Working with VOs to collect direct input for:
      * Production resource planning (with Dan). Input received from LIGO, D0, GLUE-X, DOSAR, JDEM.
      * Software Enhancement Proposals (with Alain). Input received from GLUE-X.

   * Staring next cycle of updates to:
      * Scientific publications resulting from substantial use of OSG.
      * Stakeholder plans/needs and requirements database, with emphasis on: (i) current production averages, (ii) future production estimates.
