---++Purpose
This document is being used to create a centralized list of problems encountered by different VOs when they submit jobs to the OSG. The purpose of this document is to use this information in developing a strategic approach for tackling/testing for as many of these problems as is reasonable.

---++ Problems encountered when accessing remote sites
   1 Do sites that advertise access to specific VOs actually allow that VO to run?
   1 Is GRAM working?
   1 Is the Grid-proxy expired?

---++ Problems encountered when trying to deploy software (either on a WN or on a Gatekeeper)
   1 Is !GridFTP up and available to be used to stage-in scripts for building software stacks? (LIGO)
   1 Are outgoing connections available? 
   1 Is $OSG_APP defined, mounted, and provisioned, and does it have the correct permissions set?
   1 Is $OSG_APP over quota? (Is the size reasonable, sometimes it is underestimated?)
   1 Are development tools available (configure, make, C & C++ compilers) (LIGO) 

---++ Problems encountered when submitting a job
   1 Does the output location for the job exist and have the correct permissions?
   1 Is the output location over quota?
   1 Is !GridFTP available to stage the job?
   1 Is Condor-G working correctly on the submit host? (Is the configuration correct?)
   1 Is the jobmanager working?

---++ Problems encountered when running a job
   1 Is $OSG_DATA defined, mounted, and provisioned, and does it have the correct permissions set?
   1 Is $OSG_DATA over quota? (again reasonable use is often underestimated)
   1 Is $OSG_WN_TMP defined, mounted, and provisioned, and does it have the correct permissions set?
   1 Is $OSG_WN_TMP over quota?
   1 Is the worker node architecture compatible with the software that was built on the head node?
   1 Are outgoing connections being blocked by a firewall?
   1 Are hostnames being resolved?

---++ How are Job error messages handled?
   1 GridJobStatus: Done; Globus error 8
   1 ...

---++ Strategic thoughts
   1 "The various discussions I had during the AHM and your presentation made me think that the pilot job should do more than just verify the OSG environment. I think the user should be able to configure the pilot in such a way that it verifies whatever requirements the user's application has. The pilots that are started on behalf of the user should also keep a record of errors which in turn could be used to create statistics. Both features are currently present in our E@OSG software." (Robert E., LIGO)
