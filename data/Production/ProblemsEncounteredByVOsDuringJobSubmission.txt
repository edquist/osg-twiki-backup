---++Purpose
This document is being used to create a centralized list of problems encountered by different VOs when they submit jobs to the OSG. The purpose of this document is to use this information in developing a strategic approach for tackling/testing for as many of these problems as is reasonable.

---++ Problems encountered when accessing remote sites
   1 Do sites that advertise access to specific VOs actually allow that VO to run?
   1 Is GRAM working?

---++ Problems encountered when trying to deploy software (either on a WN or on a Gatekeeper)
   1 Is GridFTP up and available to be used to stage-in scripts for building software stacks? (LIGO)
   1 Are outgoing connections available? 
   1 Is $OSG_APP defined, and provisioned, and does it have the right permissions?
