   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.7M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.2M managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 165K jobs per day
         * failed 72K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  94%
      * Downtime of CERN PanDA services and BNL T1 are over, all production services are operational now. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~300TB/day
   * Issues
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : working on that, will try out on RHIC resources first, then expand to ATLAS resources.  &#12288;

   * Open ticket: NWICG_ NotreDame

   * GLIDEINS
      * Submitted File transfer dag to Harvard-East, two transfer jobs fail with time out error, submitted rescue
      * CIT_CMS_T2 glidin work-flow not starting up, trouble shooting with Mats
      * NoterDame work-flow fails, looks like  /dscratch/osg/bestman may not be mounted on all WNs

   * Tested Pegasus 3.0.1 release
