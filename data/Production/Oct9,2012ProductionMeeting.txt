   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * glideinWMS software team helped us determine high load issues was due to an unexpected python behavior.
         * For each forked process using popen, python attempts to close all file descriptors by default.
         * We had set high max file descriptor limits (~50k) for the gfactory user previously to accommodate the Atlas testing.
         * Reducing limits (back to default 1k) on ITB cut the load on the machine in half.  This weekend I reduced the limits on UCSD and GOC Production.

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

At the OSG Council call today (Oct 9), SBGrid noted that they are not getting as many opportunistic cores as has been the case in the past.  This also reminds us of the remark from GLOW that they have great difficulty in getting more than 100K hours per day.  Thus there is some issue here that may need to be reviewed.  The OSG Council is asking the OSG Project to examine the broad area of opportunistic availability for VOs and determine the current state, problems, and future directions.  We need to frame the questions that need to be addressed.  Chander proposes to work with Dan and Lothar to review this matter and determine next steps.
