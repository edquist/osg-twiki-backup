   * Problems uploading RSV to SAM 10-12/Dec, problem located and resolved.
   * Software 3.0.4 [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/12/osg-software-304-release.html][release notes]]
   * ITB release
      * Pre-release repository added to repo.grid.iu.edu
      * Some broken links repaired.
      * Removed an alert that sent directly to goc@.
      * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-december.html][Release notes]] are available.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Began testing a new condor_gridmanager from Jaime Frey of the Condor team on the ITB factory to help handle some issues with held jobs we get on EGI CREAM sites.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release.
   * Two additional instances of BDII will be added to DNS RR.
      * Added at 9:00 EST, both had crashed by slightly after 11:00 EST. Removed from RR by 13:00. 
      * RCA In Progress - [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/BDIIv5RCA][Link]]. 
   * 8 hour window, statring on hour early. (8:00 eastern)
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Testing the condor_gridmanager took precedence over general testing of glideinWMS 2.5.3 and condor 7.6.4 last week so we will hold off on upgrading GOC factory this week but may still upgrade UCSD depending on how testing goes this week.
