---++ CMS (Tony)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Past Sunday LHC finished the pp collision program for this year. So we finished with the total collected luminosity for ATLAS at 5.25fb-1. LHC preparation is underway for the Heavy Ion collisions. On the way they may try a 2 day run of proton to Heavy Ion collisions. The expected period for the Heavy Ion run is Nov.14 - Dec.8.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was mainly stable, at the average level of 12K running jobs, with the exception of a drop on Mon-Tue. The problem was caused by misconfiguration of Panda at one of the ATLAS T1 sites, which created a big number of holding jobs, and backlog to register big amount of files, and load on the database. All the clouds were set to brokeroff for half a day. Situation is back to normal now, but all this event is under investigation to understand the chain of events and prevent it from reoccurring.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.1M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 87% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 915K
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 350T~550T/day at BNL T1 in last week.
   * Issues

---+++ Gratia Reports

   * Current week's total usage: 4 users utilized 13 sites
      * 65540 jobs total (46937 / 18603 = 71.6% success)
      * 109418.5 wall clock hours total (100357.0 / 9061.5 = 91.7% success)
   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 30 sites
      * 29085 jobs total (21346 / 7739 = 73.4% success)
      * 69091.6 wall clock hours total (61624.4 / 7467.2 = 89.2% success)


---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * One 50,000 job dag submitted to local glidein factory, running over 18 OSG sites
      * Monitoring progress, no issues
   * Local OSG ITB testbed "LIGO_CIT" will be decommisioned
      * LIGO would like to utilize OSG glidein factory
---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/10/goc-service-update-tuesday-october-25th.html][Release note]] was deferred.
   * OS updates on production machines. Some reboots were required.
   * The recent JAVA security issue:
      * http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuoct2011-443431.html
      * We will update this in the next regularly scheduled maintenance window and are prepared to update in the event of an incident.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Updated to most recent Tomcat
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Registered Engage VO frontend at Renci with GOC Production factory
      * Began installing itb test frontend that we will use to test changes we make to the GOC ITB factory

---+++ Operations This Week

   * BDII v5 Validation Status Check
   * ITB release
      * Adding capability to use attachments with ticket exchange
   * Next week will do previous release.

---++ Engage (Mats)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * RPM testing
      * Limited availability release of wn-client, osg-client, glexec
      * Steve Timm at FNAL will do larger scalability testing of glexec as worker nodes become available
      * xrootd installed at UC_ITB, looking for more ATLAS sites to help test
      * CE testing is going well, running into some issues but being resolved
      * Tony @ FNAL is conducting interoperability testing, no major problems so far

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ User Support (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * I am out sick. Just a written report below
   * Operational Security: 
      * Open incident and vulnerability tickets are closed. CERN incident and Java vulnerability
      * Kevin Hill replaced Jim Barlow for operational security
      * No new vulnerabilities, incidents
   * Ongoing updates and tests
      * New CA packages are in ITB being tested as the default package for all software
      * Need to hear from ITB about test progress/results/problems
      * Once tests are over, we need Productions/Operations team's help to handle the transition to production
   * Related to new VDT infrastructure (Koji, svn servers, etc), we need help from Operations team to understand CA package release process.
