---++ Action/Significant Items: 

---++ Attendees:

---++ Apologies:

---++ CMS (Tony)
   * CMS Production for the week:
      * 141,090,999 hours
      * 967,587 pilots

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was overall stable, at the average level of 43-53K running job slots.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilots, 3.3M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 70% (for single core jobs)
      * 1.9M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.  
   * Data Transfer rate is ~ 350TB/day at BNL tier1 last week.
   * osg-wn-client tarball in OSG 3.3 series drops dcap client tools (e.g. dccp), which is still being used by ATLAS production jobs on many USATLAS sites. If USATLAS transitions to OSG 3.3 *today*, many sites will have to keep the old osg-wn-client from OSG 3.2 on worker nodes.

---++ Software (Tim C.)
   * February development is (essentially) complete
   * Still working on migrating hosts away from batlab.org domain
   * Need to turn OSG CE data collection workflow into something more robust and reusable
   * Lots of site support, especially with CEs (Caltech, Clemson, Colorado, FIU, Harvard, MIT, OSC, Vanderbilt)
   * Still working (slowly) on eliminating software.grid.iu.edu
