---++ Engagement (Mats)

9 users utilized 35 sites;

13230 jobs total (10593 / 2637 = 80.1% success);

57190.1 wall clock hours total (56711.6 / 478.5 = 99.2% success);


Engagement production is still hurting from the ReSS server move.

https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=7070

Many sites, but not all, have restarted Tomcat. We inject static classads to make up for missing sites. The issue was discussed back in January and I think most of us thought the issue had been resolved. A fix is apparently in the new point release of VDT 2.0.0, which we will verify. 

Note that the DNS caching affects all services we have in Tomcat: VOMS / VOMRS / GUMS / CEMon / others, so it is very important to get the problem resolved.

Email from January:

Engagement recently upgraded our VOMS and as part of the upgrade we
moved the service to a new machine. In order to make the transition easy
for the sites, we kept the old hostname and just changed the IP address.

We were surprised when authentication stopped working on some well
maintained sites. It turns out that this is a new version of an old
problem - the fact that Tomcat/Java is set to cache resolved DNS entries
forever by default. The reason I'm saying that this is an old problem is
that I believe we had the same issue during a BDII / CEMon server move
last year. For example, see:

https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=5292

In our case, it is the GUMS servers that are keeping the IP address of
our old VOMS server.

Requiring OSG wide service restarts when we move machines seems like a
bad idea. I suggest we change the tomcat init.d scripts to set the
caching timeout to something sane. See:

---++ Operations (Rob Q.)

   * Busiest ticket month YTD ~20% up from last month. (192 opened so far in June)
   * GUGrid will be removed from OSG and do future work under the Engagement umbrella
   * Released bug fix to display of downtime.
   * Thanks to Brian for finishing up some work on the RSV-Gratia probe.
   * Jim Basney has expressed concerns about how security incidents are documented in tickets instead of the TWiki. We need to have a chat with the security team about how to best meet their needs. [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=7098][Ticket]]
   * IU has a new machine room in Bloomington.
      * September 19th will be the physical move, some downtime will be experienced for all services other than BDII.
      * Short outages have been announced for this week to do some preliminary network preparation for the move.
   * IU holiday on Friday, operations will be functioning on weekend/afterhours procedures.
