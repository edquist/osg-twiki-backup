---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * ~15 khours/day
      * 17465 jobs/day
      * 89% success

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~278TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC is continuing stable data taking, and continuing to increase the luminosity. End of the week the number of the bunches have been doubled to 48 per beam. Yesterday a new record integrated luminosity day. ATLAS production was low at the very beginning of the week and then ramped up to the usual average of 9k running jobs, mainly simulation. Waiting for the next big scale re-simulation of all the existing MC samples, as well as full reprocessing of data samples in September. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 78%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): no report this week (shift captain is on vacation)
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~400TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * Open more job slots to OSG users: talked to management at T1, decision coming soon.

      * Nebraska --> CIT_CMS_T2 transfers
         * 12 dags, transferring 5000 files each,  using 10 different gsiftp servers  at both ends
         * Submitted Wednesday, still running: data transfers finish fast, md5sum checks sit in remote queue
         * Testing fix for remote_initialdir problem at CIT_CMS_T2
      * Will test Glidein transfer dag to see if md5sum check complete faster
