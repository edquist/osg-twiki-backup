---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)
---+++ Operations last week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/35zl55c][Security Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * GGUS certificate update was completed 10:30 EST 9/Dec, one ticket generated in the downtime, it automatically re-triggered itself.
   * Some OSG Display results were affected by normal delays in the Gratia database.
---+++ Operations this week
   * Soichi Hayashi and Tom Lee available for emergencies 15/Dec through 2/Jan.
   * Operations calls 20 and 27/Dec canceled
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/12/goc-service-update-december-14th-2010.html][Release notes]]
      * RSV update delayed until 11/Jan for further testing
   * Problem with FNAL certificates due to ":" in the DN. Current evaluation is that FNAL DNs are in violation of [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt][standard]]. All known FNAL users with a problem are using their DoEGrid certificates without difficulty.
   * is4 may join DNS round robin next Tuesday, pending CMS evaluation. (Scott and Rob are available to watch/revert)

---++ Integration (Suchandra)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Metrics (Brian)

---+++ CDF

   * CDF representatives had a good meeting with Chander, Gabriele and Marko last week. There are a couple near-term action items. The VO Group/User Support would like to touch base every 2-3 months.
   * KISTI may have found its pbs errors; waiting on VOMS update. 

---+++ GLUE-X

   * believes he has fixed SE problem for D0.
   * Production running well.
   * Initial job submission through glideinWMS successful, but has a proxy issue; Richard is in touch with Jeff Dost, who recommended Richard get GUMS template updated. Next: run builds on diverse sites.
   * Errors in reporting should be addressed via GOC tickets so that sites have accurate information in BDII.

---+++ Misc
   * ALICE has two sites operating on the OSG and reporting to the WLCG. Will work future issues in this forum.
