---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Last week's status history 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yejwd2j][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector]] - NOTE: After delays due to holidays, etc. GOC has fixed minor bug that was causing service availability to be miscalculated in isolated cases.
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ybo4sjd][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/01/osg-125-release-notice.html][OSG 1.2.5 was released last week]]
   * Relevant to only WLCG Interop sites: SAM team has indicated there was a broker problem between Jan 8th 11:00 and Jan 9th 13:00 (UTC) that may be causing bad LCG availability numbers; GOC will resend RSV records, and SAM team will recompute numbers.
   * On continued examination of the case where sites stopped reporting properly to one of the collectors we've decided to wait to hear more from the gratia developers before pinging the 40-some affected sites with tickets.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-12.html][Production release Tuesday - Jan 12th 14:00 UTC]]*
      * OIM 1.12 (Updated footer link for reporting bugs, Updated the !DivRep framework to latest version, Modified certificate requirement verbiage)
      * !MyOSG 1.13 (Updated the footer link for reporting bugs, Removed the invalid link in misc page, Changed the h3 header background - and adjusted CSS accordingly, Set "Now" as the default for status history and links that leads to status history pages, Changed verbiage on Resource Group home page, Fixed the typo reported by Brian on Resource Group filter, Added filter by "Support Center" for VO page ([[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7848][related ticket]]))
      * Ticket 1.12 (Updated the h3 background, Updated the footer link for reporting bug)
      * No service outages are expected during this upgrade but the GOC reserves 1 hour for unforeseen problems.
   * GOC continuing to pursue the case of [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7913][some CEs stopping to upload data to central collector]] - according to resident CEMon expert (Parag), it may have been a combination of default configuration and timeouts; expect confirmation in the near future.
      * GOC will add is2 back into DNS RR for is.grid.iu.edu
      * Purdue Ceaser Retired
