   * General production status
      * During the last two weeks USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 8~10K running jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 81%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 648K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 93K jobs per day
         * failed 44K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 94%,  walltime - 94%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. 
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:

  * Gratia reports:
 
   * Current week's total usage: 3 users utilized 33 sites
      * 2675 jobs total (2601 / 74 = 97.2% success);
      * 34.9 wall clock hours total (28.8 / 6.1 = 82.5% success);
   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 30 sites;
      * 2424 jobs total (2372 / 52 = 97.9% success);
      * 30.4 wall clock hours total (25.7 / 4.7 = 84.5% success);
 
 
   * E@H reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 78,298.67015, Last Week: 170,585.60004
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 10 (-7)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 13 (-2)
   
   * Robert is implementing changes to improve error handling
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace

    * LIGO-Pegasus face-to-face meeting was held yesterday

    * 3 day test work-flow on Firefly: Gap in data error
      * suspected to be bug in LIGO code
      * Duncan Brown was alerted   
      * Test run on a different data set in progress, no failed jobs so far
