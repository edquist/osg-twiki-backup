---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) John M., Xin, Armen, Britta, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * Short collision data taking periods past Sunday and Monday. LHC stops Dec.16 afternoon for Christmas break. Technical preparations during January. Beams restart not earlier than Feb.14. 
   * General production status
      * During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 7-8K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. 
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1043K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 92%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 979K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 140K jobs per day
         * failed 85K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 95%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 transferred ~75TB/day data last week. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. Ganglia routine check in place, no conclusion yet.
      * GOC ticket 7798: automatic ticket routing between BNL RT and GOC ticket system, under investigation. 

---++ LIGO (Britta)

---+++ Einstein at Home

   *  NEW FORMAT   (?)
This weeks Gratia reports show 5 users utilizing 31 sites, 35221 jobs were completed with 84.7% success rate. Wall clock hour consumption lies at 289669.3 with 90% success rate. Einstein at Home reports 702,805.33843 recent average credits (RAC) which puts the Caltech Open Science grid team at rank three in the list of top participants this week. The rank based on accumulated credits moves up to 11 from last week's 12.  Work has started to expand to Fermilab sites. Two GOC tickets are open for LIGO: UC_Teraport ( outgoing connections needed on worker nodes) and MIT_CMS (authentication problem). No further production issues occurred.

   * OLD FORMAT

   * Gratia reports:
      * 5 users utilized 31 sites
      * 35221 jobs total (29847 / 5374 = 84.7% success)
      * 289669.3 wall clock hours total (260581.5 / 29087.8 = 90.0% success)
 
   * E@H reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 702,805.33843
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 3 (+1)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 11 (+0)
  
   * Robert has started work to expand to Fermilab sites

   * Two GOC tickets are open for LIGO:
      * MIT_CMS authentication issue
      * UC_TERAPORT we need outgoing connections on worker nodes  

---+++ Binary Inspiral
   * There was no activity this week due to vacation taken by Britta Daudert.

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/Minutes2009November30][Previous Week Agenda]]
   * Last week's status history 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yejwd2j][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector]] - NOTE: minor bug causing service availability to be calculated in isolated cases, GOC has fix they hope to release tomorrow
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ybo4sjd][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-december-8th.html][ITB - !MyOSG and Ticket updated]]
   * RSV daily reports show inaccurate WLCG GridView numbers - SAm/GridView experienced DB errors plus they are old algorithm for daily numbers, which they expect to fix in a couple of weeks.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * GOC VOMS (serving OSGEDU and MIS, VOs) will updated to latest release - short downtime to be expected - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-december-8th.html][release note]]
   * Ticket and MyOSG will be updated - no outage expected - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/12/goc-service-update-tuesday-december-8th.html][release note]]
