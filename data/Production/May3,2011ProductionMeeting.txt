---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.0M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 148K jobs per day
         * failed 71K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%, walltime - 97%
      * Panda jobs processed, as reported by Panda monitor, on USATLAS sites:
         * 620K panda jobs processed for last week. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * HCC opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: general agreement reached, implementation details (group quota) are in work progress at BNL.
      * LIGO jobs excessively accessing BNL srm server caused problems.
         * opportunistic VOs need to be prepared for massive preemption 
         * resource owners need to be prepared to stop new connections if needed 
      * ATLAS asks for updating LFC packages in VDT/OSG client.  Met with VDT last week to flesh out details.

      * 254621.3 wall clock hours total (128106.9 / 126514.4 = 50.3% success)
   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 38sites
      *  49448 jobs total (20275 / 29173 = 41.0% success)
      * 285275.0 wall clock hours total (191149.9 / 94125.1 = 67.0% success)

   * E@H rank based on RAC: 4 (+2)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * Data transfers:  1 week data (0.14 TB ) to OUHEP_OSG 2 days, 11.5 hrs
   * 1 week work-flow test runs:  Submitted to CIT_CMS_T2, OUHEP_OSG
   *  trouble shooting failed 1 week work-flow at FF work-flow

---++ Security (Mine)
   * No new vulnerabilities/incidents. It is still unclear if the Incident at Oak Ridge lab has affected TeraGrid resources. If so it may affect OSG users who have access to TG. 
   * Received a request from EGI security team for a joint incident drill (SSC5). We had another joint incident drill involving tier1s couple years ago. This one seems to involve only Atlas job submission framework and some select sites -- not all the production sites. I will need to get more information on what is tested, which sites are targeted, whether our production sites are willing to participate, and given all these plans, whether security team has sufficient effort to plan, prepare and conduct the drill in OSG. European target dates are to start on May 23rd and end on May 29th.
