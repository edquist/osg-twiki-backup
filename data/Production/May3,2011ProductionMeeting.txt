   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.0M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 148K jobs per day
         * failed 71K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%, walltime - 97%
      * Panda jobs processed, as reported by Panda monitor, on USATLAS sites:
         * 620K panda jobs processed for last week. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * HCC opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: general agreement reached, implementation details (group quota) are in work progress at BNL.
      * LIGO jobs excessively accessing BNL srm server caused problems. LIGO changed their workflow to use local NFS area. 
      * ATLAS asks for updating LFC packages in VDT/OSG client.  Met with VDT last week to flesh out details.
