---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.15 / 1.2.32
      *       70 (0) OSG 3.x (      13 are 3.1.15)
      *       36 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       1 are 1.2.32)

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

SNOWMASS LHC-Theory group is in full production via vo=osg; used >100K hours per day for the last two days.

Talked with SMU staff yesterday; they have biologists who need more computing than is locally available.  We are discussing options with them including BOSCO, using their local cluster, flocking to OSG-XSEDE, or setting up a front-end.  They are working to understand the characteristic of the user’s job.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incident
      * None
   * Operations
      * Traceability requirements. Security team installed and ran a test frontend to examine the tracing capability. This Friday we will do a security exercise with OSG-XSEDE frontend. We will go through in detail how much of the traceability requiremenst can be met by the frontend as it is. WE will share our findings with area coordinators. 
      * New CIlogon Basic CA feature. Enhanced command line client. It can create a certificate and proxy on the command line instantly. It works very similar to CIlogon Basic CA that works with browsers. User authenticates with their campus and receives an automatic certificate form CILogon Basic. If you have users who can benefit, please contact security team. 
      * Security team is integrated into the new VO registration process. First two VOs Jlab and Glas. How should we connect with them? 
      * CVMFS risk assessment is completed by security team. We will send this to GOC staff tomorrow. If there is no mistakes and disagreement, we will send this to OSG Mgmt and file our assessment. 
      * OSG PKI. DOEgrids stopped issuing certificate yesterday. From now on we only use OSG CA. Still documentation work needed. We notice many release documents still point to DOEGrids, we are working on this and clean it up by next week. The documentation for the new PKI was completed a while ago, but it did not get linked into all other OSG documentation.
