---++ LIGO (Britta)

 * Current week's total usage: 4 users utilized 12 sites
      * 40041 jobs total (16260 / 23781 = 40.6% success)
      * 43626.7 wall clock hours total (35387.1 / 8239.6 = 81.1% success)
   * Previous week's total usage: 3 users utilized 7 sites
      * 21810 jobs total (6419 / 15391 = 29.4% success)
      * 14306.5 wall clock hours total (9116.6 / 5189.9 = 63.7% success)

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR

   * Monitoring 50,000 job dag submitted to local glidein factory, running over 12 OSG sites

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Short outage in Ticket exchange between GOC and !ServiceNow. Patched and currently working.
   * ITB release, largely internal updates. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/goc-service-update-tuesday-february-28.html][Release note]]
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Investigated outage between GOC-TX and !ServiceNow.  Both S. Timm and A. Tiradani are now on !ServiceNow integration list which means we will get a heads-up from further WSDL changes.  Support model still under discussion with !ServiceNow maintainers to work with Axis and other Java-based services.
      * GOC ticket 11711, a spam ticket about hair extensions, was opened via ticket.grid.iu.edu and forwarded to !ServiceNow on Sat. 2/25.
      * Gratia operations investigation discovered a !MyOSG bug that wasn't sending email to contacts that didn't have DN's, will that be fixed in production release this week?
      * Gratia total VO count now stands at 87, down from a max of 564.  Much of it traced to misconfigured PBS and LSF sites.  Patches already made available for Gratia PBS in osg 1.2.27, in progress for LSF.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Condor failing with bug when calling glexec in europe; ATLAS pilots require glexec
         * Dan Bradley from condor team gave us a patched condor tarball to send out with glideins only for problem sites.
         * This only affects UCSD factory since ATLAS only submits from there for now while ramping up.
      * Hold limits have changed for gwms 2.5.4.  If any single VO reaches the limit it stops submission for all other VOs.  This is not expected behavior.
         * Should be fixed in gwms 2.5.6
         * Until then we have to manually remove glideins as they approach limits.
      * XSEDE pilots now accepted at Nebraska (was gums mapping error)
      * We are testing glideinWMS 2.5.5

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release, notes above.
   * Domain switch and web page move are in progress. 
      * opensciencegrid.org DNS will be moving to IU.
         * Ongoing - [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OpenScienceGridDomain][Plan]]
      * Current webpages at www.opensciencegrid.org will point to the OSG TWiki. 
         * Done - [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OpenScienceGridWeb][Plan]]
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * May upgrade ITB Factory only to glideinWMS 2.5.5 
      * Will begin testing condor 7.7.4
      * No plans to upgrade Production Factories this week

---+++ Gratia Review

   * 21 Tickets opened on sites that had stopped or never reported to Gratia
      * Deactivated: NYSGRID-CUNY-GRID, OSG_LIGO_MIT, UTA_DPCC, GLOW-OSG, UCLA_Saxon_ Tier3, SBGrid-Harvard-Exp 
      * 14 Tickets Still Open

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)

---+++Bosco
