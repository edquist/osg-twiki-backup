---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC is continuing mostly stable data taking, and continuing to improve the luminosity.ATLAS production was low at the very beginning of the week and then ramped up to the usual average of 8-9k running jobs, mostly simulation.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.0M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 73%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 917k managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 131K jobs per day
         * failed 37K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 91%, walltime - 93%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~500TB/day.
