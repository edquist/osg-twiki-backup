   * General production status
      * US Cloud production was stable at ~8K/day running jobs last week. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.1M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 81%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.4M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 206K jobs per day
         * failed 133K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 94%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate is 200~250TB/day last week. Consistent with 
   * Issues
      * BDII uploading to WLCG: info size limit exceeded, causing no info from BNL on cern BDII, critical for production
         * cern BDII has a limit of 5MB
         * some mis-configured info from BNL CE GIP, being worked on.   
      * Opportunistic SE usage for D0 : mapping issues should be fixed. Further tests are interrupted by a major problem on the local xrootd SE at UTA T2, which is now understood. Will continue and do more testing this week.

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Availability metrics for the last week 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/y48765w][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]]
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/y27mhfv][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * *BNLT1 issue with top level WLCG BDII*
      * Resource_group (BNL_ATLAS) got dropped from top level WLCG BDII sometime on Friday; [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8451#1271454066][See followup ticket here]]
         * Note from ticket: The EGEE/WLCG top-level BDII currently has a limit of 5 MB per source: if a site produces more, it is rejected as a protection against misconfigured sites. An update is expected to be released soon that will increase the limit to 10 MB.  In the meantime sites will have to comply with the 5 MB limit to avoid problems.
         * It was suggested that the GOC alert members whose BDII entries may soon reach the limit.
   * *IUPUI Network Glitch on April 18th 2010*
      * IUPUI based GOC services [is2, myosg2, ticket2, oim, twiki] may have been intermittently unavailable for 1-2 hours on the early morning (US-Eastern) hours of Sunday, April 18th 2010 
         * is1 based out of Bloomington continued to work fine through the morning as did myosg1, ticket1
   * *Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * *GGUS*
         * GGUS presented null data for some fields where this was not allowed; GOC patched production instance to check for this case, and present warning
      * *BNL RT*
         * Tweaked OIM SC registration to use GOC-TX for real production tickets; following approval from ATLAS; Working well
            * [[http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AQGl_1gJKDWDZGY5ZnR6anZfMjFmMmpzZmc1cA&hl=en#Transition_from_email_based_ex_7272405605382354][GOC-TX  section with detailed transition proposal]]
      * *FNAL Remedy*
         * Further connections issues and problem with web service interface reported to Remedy developers; Not high priority at FNAL
      * *VDT*, *PROD_SLAC*, *UC_CI*, *SBGrid* - No change

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * *GGUS*
         * No updates
      * *BNL RT*
         * Add custom field setting on BNL-RT to provide GOCTicket number (shown on RT side under meta-data) - under ITB testing
         * Discussing further action items with BNL developer
      * *FNAL Remedy* - No Change, waiting on FNAL action discussed above
      * *VDT*, *PROD_SLAC*, *UC_CI*, *SBGrid* - No Change, waiting on GOC action discussed below
         * GOC has promised simple instructions on how to setup RT to use GOC-TX; depending on ease and priority, these SCs may adopt use of GOC-TX
   * *Ongoing - Top Level WLCG BDII Monitoring* 
      * GOC is still working out details with CMS; Monitor top level WLCG BDIIs (list of IPs RR'ed by DNS) for presence of recent data for all WLCG-Interop-BDII enabled OSG resources
      * Action items upon finding a problem still not clear - being worked out with CMS and OSG management
