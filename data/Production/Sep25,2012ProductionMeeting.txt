---++ CMS (Tony)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Most of last week was technical stop for LHC, with slow restart on Friday with cryogenics problems. Almost no change in collected luminosity, currently for ATLAS is ~14 fb-1. Agreement between LHC and experiments on luminosity in 2012 - minor changes with slight expected increase for instantaneous luminosity.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was mostly stable, at the average level around 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type. Saturday there was a short ATLAS wide drop in production due to panda server proxy expiration, with quick recovery after the updated proxy was installed.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.1M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 107% (?)
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around ~350TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues

   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/special-maintenance-window-for-goc.html][Glidein special maintenance]] completed without issues.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/osg-campus-infrastructures-community.html][OSG Campus Infrastructures Community Workshop]] announced. 14-15/Nov at UCSC.
   * ITB release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/goc-service-update-tuesday-september_19.html][Release note]]
      * rebuilt oim-itb from offsite backup in 8 minutes.
   * Adjusted the timing of the rsv-collector-available probe, rsv.grid.iu.edu now showing 100% A/R (last few days)
   * FermiGrid Ops
      * ReSS was down for <1 hour. Cause is still under investigation.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * ITB Factory stuck again after reboot, Tom discovered it may be due network adapters failing to startup correctly
      * Discovered glideinWMS bug causing the wrong condor tarballs to be selected on the workernode for the glideins to use
         * This is only affecting ITB Factory right now (running special glideinWMS branch_v2_6_1_gf1) and we are working with glideinWMS support to get it solved.
