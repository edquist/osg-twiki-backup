---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Most of last week was technical stop for LHC, with slow restart on Friday with cryogenics problems. Almost no change in collected luminosity, currently for ATLAS is ~14 fb-1. Agreement between LHC and experiments on luminosity in 2012 - minor changes with slight expected increase for instantaneous luminosity.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was mostly stable, at the average level around 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type. Saturday there was a short ATLAS wide drop in production due to panda server proxy expiration, with quick recovery after the updated proxy was installed.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.1M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 107% (?)
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around ~350TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
