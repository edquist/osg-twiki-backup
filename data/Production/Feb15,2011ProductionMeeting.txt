   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.5M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 215K jobs per day
         * failed 88K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 95%, walltime - 96%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~400TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * RSV issues in the new OSG release caused lower WLCG availability and reliability for BNL T1. Rolled back to previous OSG release. Needs help from GOC to correct the RSV numbers for the last several days, before WLCG report is out for the month. 
      * Downtime info was resent by GOC to WLCG, to correct the WLCG site availability report for last month. 
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : OSG quota is in place, available job slots for OSG users is increased to 60.
