---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC hardware commissioning will finish by the end of the week, first beam expected Saturday, starting beam commissioning period.
      * ATLAS production was relatively stable during the week at the average level of 10-12k running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.5M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 215K jobs per day
         * failed 88K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 95%, walltime - 96%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~400TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * RSV issues in the new OSG release caused lower WLCG availability and reliability for BNL T1. Rolled back to previous OSG release. Needs help from GOC to correct the RSV numbers for the last several days, before WLCG report is out for the month. 
      * Downtime info was resent by GOC to WLCG, to correct the WLCG site availability report for last month. 
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : in progress.

At the VO Forum call last week, we had a discussion on VO's experiences running long jobs. Marko Slyz & Gabriele Garzoglio have a user with earthquake simulation jobs running ~46 hours+ (typically, many jobs don't run at the same time). Tests have generated job disconnects, blocks, or evictions, so they are trying to figure out ways to optimize. Do VOs have any recommendation of either how to find clusters or knowledge of clusters that permit long job runs that do not have a fixed time limit?
