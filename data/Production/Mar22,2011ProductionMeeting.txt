---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * ITB testing ongoing
      * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p26.html][Changes for OSG 1.2.19]]
      * In ITB testing,  tentatively scheduling for next tuesday (March 29)
      * Troubleshooting RSV probe issues and timing
   * HTPC
      * Waiting for payload or test job to run against ITB sites

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Production testing of the new certificates are under planning. We wrote full directives on how a site admin should conduct the tests. 
   * Important operational test: We made a test of incident response process over the weekend. We discovered several issues. We will follow up with GOC on this important issue. 
   * A lot of ssh attacks and Trojan activity. Nothing targeted towards the grid. Nevertheless, CERN security team and REN-ISAC decided to encourage sites to report the incidents to the law enforcement. We are working on what type of an announcement should OSG send out the our sites. We will focus on technical information.
   * No severe vulnerabilities. A few kernel level exploits were reported last week but none has escalated to the root. 
   * No sites reporting to Pakiti seems to have a high level exploit. 
   * RA ticket metrics. We are analyzing the ticket lifetimes on a per ticket basis weekly. We are setting up meetings with RA Agents to go over the process.   
   * Bugs/errors/support tickets: 
      * GOC ssl re-negotiation ticket is closed. Security team evaluated the proposed solution and approved it.
      * DOEgrids host certificate problems: WE found the problem for one type of certificate type. Suchandra will get a new personal certificate. For other people, we understand the problem is different. WE are creating separate tickets and continue to debug.
   * Training: Igor sent out the security survey to site security contacts as we reported at last week. We received 6 responses so far. We are discussing what best ways to follow up on this work item. 
   * Items in waiting: SBgrid requested an evaluation of their authentication portal. Xrootd requested an evaluation of their authentication mechanism.
