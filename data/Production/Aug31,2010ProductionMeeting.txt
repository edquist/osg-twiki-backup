---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC has another good week with significant collected luminosity. At the moment technical stop till Thursday. ATLAS production level during last week was quite low (2-4k running jobs), and not stable. Yesterday ramped back up to the normal level of average 9-10k running jobs.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.1M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 64%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): no report this week (shift captain is on vacation)
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was ~400TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * SE-only info publishing to WLCG BDII for all USATLAS T3 sites: under test now.  
      * Open more job slots to OSG users: no updates, people on vacation
