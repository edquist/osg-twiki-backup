---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/ct2mfy6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/OASISStatusUpdate][Oasis Status]]

   * ITB release, release note in preparation
      * update wordpress version on web.grid
      * update condor on osg-xd machine
      * New  RSV collector/reporter has been certified
   * Software Repo did not need disk increase. 
   * OSG-XSEDE experienced some issues for select users using SSH. 
      * locauthorize wasn't turned on in authconfig.

   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded SDSC Factory to glideinWMS v3_2 (pre-release) and HTCondor to 8.0.2.
      * Discovered HTCondor-G bug that affects submission to cream and nordugrid sites if using OSG rpms for globus libraries.
         * nordugrid_gahp processes were stuck in busy loops, hogging cpu
         * Jaime Frey provided a patch and it will get into HTCondor 8.0.4
      * Discovered glideinWMS 3_2 bug where NordurgridRSL was not properly being passed on glidein submission.
         * glideinWMS developers provided a patch and it will be put into official v3_2 release.
      * SDSC disk became over 80% full. This was due to starting the new v3_2 instance. We cleared out all the logs from the old v2 instance freeing 100G.
         * Cleanup took ~7 hours. SDSC was in effective downtime on Friday during this time but the GOC and CERN factories continued to serve the frontends while SDSC was down.
   * OSG-Connect
      * New Operational Effort, attendance should start soon.

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

We appear to have identified the scaling issue in Public storage using iRODS; Tanya will recode a module to use substantially less memory.

Snowmass and ECFA appear to be wrapping up their work.  So many more cycles are likely to be available for other users.

Next week we plan to integrate in the OSG-XD adjunct server to increase the overall capacity of the front-end (estimate that we will be able to do 20K simultaneous jobs).  As part of this we plan to start sending jobs to FNAL without invoking GLExec (this will only be done for jobs submitted at the OSG-XD host – not for jobs that flock to this system).

There is modest growth in the number of active users per week from XSEDE; at the beginning of the year we averaged 4 and now we are seeing about 8 per week.

We continue to help identify issues for gGactory operations that are affecting production for vo=osg; the most recent was pilots failing at RENCI-Blueridge


---++ Security (Kevin)
   * No new major incidents or vulnerabilities last week.
   * Investigating what OSG software release is the oldest safe release from a security vulnerability perspective. Looks like cvmfs update was the most recent big security issue, but still investigating other recent security updates.
