---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status.
      * LHC started collisions with stable beams since Friday. USATLAS total production over the past week was stable, at the average level of 53-60K running job slots.  
      * Degraded performance for transfers from BNL to CERN reported last week. BNL switched the primary circuit to the secondary circuit with different path, which recovered the throughput to normal levels. The investigation of the primary path found a faulty fiber optic module installed at one of routers at CERN. Until replacement the production traffic will continue using the secondary circuit.   
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.0M pilots, 3.9M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 85% (for single core jobs)
      * 1.5M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.
