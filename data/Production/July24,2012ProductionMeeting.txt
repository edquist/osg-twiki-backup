</ins><del>   * Emergencies/Incidents/Vulnerabilities
</del><del>      * No emergencies. 
</del><ins>---++ Integration (Suchandra)
</ins><del>      * Evaluated the sudo vulnerability. Turns out does not affect osg sites. Made a blog posting. will not make an announcement.
</del><del>   * Operations
</del><del>      * Phasing out old layout certificate bundles from production. Checked the logs for CA bundles RPM and tarball packages. 
</del><ins>---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
</ins><del>         * For RPMs, 18 unique machines are downloading the osg-ca-certs-compat RPM bundles. 19 unique machines are downloading the igtf-ca-certs-compat RPM bundles. 211 unique machines are downloading the osg-ca-certs RPM bundles. 8 unique machines are downloading the igtf-ca-certs RPM bundles 
</del><del>         * for tarballs: FNAL and SMU downloads the new layout. 
</del><ins>---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
</ins><del>         * Focus is on checking VOMS versions. We know the older VOMS version did not work with the new layout. 
</del><del>      * Updating the CA bundles at sites automatedly. Recent RSV failure due to sites needing to perform a manual yum update. Waiting on software team to send us their decision document. 
</del><del>      * RSV CA probe. We contacted WLCG Security officer and EGI ops teams as to whether we can increase the time limit after which probe reports a failure if a site does not update its ca bundle. Found out that we can increase it up to 8 days. Currently investigating whether we can reduce this probe criticality to medium. 
</del><ins>---++ Security (Mine)
</ins><del>      * Pakiti service. Sent an inquiry to EGI ops team whetehr they allow OSG sites subscribed to their instance. Technically this is possible. Talked to the developer, the software funding does not seem to be an issue. 
</del>
