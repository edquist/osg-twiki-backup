---++ Security (Jeny, Mine) 
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * OpenSSL? vulnerabilities published last week
      * RedHat published the vulnerabilities as Low and Moderate, stating that most of their distribution is not affected.  
      * SVG has rated these vulnerabilities as ‘Low’: https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisories
   * Operations
      * New CA bundle (1.51) with IGTF 1.70 ready to be released in OSG software 3.2.32 and 3.3.6.
    OSG CA transition
      * Discovered some issues that OIM needs a software release for switching VOs to CILogon. We thought this was a configuration change not requiring a software release. But, GOC agreed to make an out-of-schedule delivery to transition Atlas. We will meet with GOC staff weekly to go over transition schedules and coordinate all other details. 
      * Atlas is transitioning this week. Still some changes to be made in OIM. Atlas expiry noticed fixed. OSG CA subscriber agreement should be put into OIM. 
      * CMS needs more testing, transition postponed for January.
      * Fermilab is in testing stage, software stack needs to be fully tested before transitioning in January. We will need a new VOMS package or the upgraded VOMS servers. We will do several voms package updates as we transition VOs. 
      * CDF and DUNE VOs are going to be also transitioned in January.
      * Multiple FQDNs in the SAN field: Implementation for command-line has been developed. This implementation is scheduled for OSG Software release in January
        Meanwhile, Atlas and CMS sites that need certificates with multiple SANs need to contact Neha Sharma (neha@fnal.gov) or Jeny Teheran (jteheran@fnal.gov). They will address the request with a manual process.
   * DCAFI Project. Distributed Computing Access with Federated Identities. This project's goal is to move IF experiments to CIlogon Basic CA and federated identities.
        There are great advances in the implementation.
