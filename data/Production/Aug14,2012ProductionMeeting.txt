---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * Bosco v1 is fundamentally code complete. We are doing a final round of testing with the development team to understand networking (e.g. firewall) limitations and then want to expand our round of testing to ITB and some Atlas T3 sites before releasing to 'production'.
   * On the HTPC front, we finally got many more partitionable slots deployed at Wisconsin and are having good luck with them. Documentation is progressing nicely.
   * Our new Campus Researcher Club engagement request form is in production now. We are working on an OSG home page link to the service.
