---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) John, Chris, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Reprocessing of the real data (only the collision data) is going on. Today the reprocessing of the simulation data started as well. US production over the week was at the level of 8K running jobs, mixture of reprocessing and simulation.  
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.5M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 208K jobs per day
         * failed 131K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 96%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred >100 TB/day data last week, with peak at 175 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  Mark from USATLAS and Joel from DZERO are in contact now.

---++ LIGO (Britta, Rob E.)

      * 64974 jobs total (45347 / 19627 = 69.8% success);
      * 713487.7 wall clock hours total (620271.2 / 93216.5 = 86.9% success);
   * Previous week's total usage: 5 users utilized 35 sites;
      * 87164 jobs total (64235 / 22929 = 73.7% success);
      * 1150309.1 wall clock hours total (1070486.7 / 79822.4 = 93.1% success);

   * E@H
      * production levels still very low on some major resources:
         * GridUNESP_CENTRAL (down, no ticket - resource not official in production )
         * BNL_ATLAS_1 ( all jobs pending for days , opened ticket )
         * BNL_ATLAS_2 ( all jobs pending, one running, opened ticket )
         * UFlorida-HPC ( -90% )
         * LIGO_UWM_NEMO ( -90% )
         * Purdue-RCAC ( 250 jobs pending, none running, opened ticket )
         * prairiefire ( -90% )

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Last week's availability metrics
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yh3t766][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]] 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yhbmbzl][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/goc-service-update-tuesday-february-9th.html][Production release Tuesday - Feb 9th 14:00 UTC]]* complete
      * MyOSG 1.15 
      * GOC Ticket 1.14
      * OIM 2.14
         * No service outages
      * RSV Collector 1.06.14 
         * The production RSV collector was down for about two hours during this upgrade; records were collected back from clients when the collector came back up. Nebraska did not come back up after the outage. Nebraska should be particularly watched in future upgrades.
   * *GOC-TX* 
      * (This concerns the project where we are developing an exchange with webservices; our production system is functioning as normal)
      * With USATLAS RT: Ongoing testing - mostly working
      * With FNAL Remedy: No update, GOC waiting on access to FNAL system
      * Ticket Exchange 1.1 Patched
   * *GOC Debian repo*: Anand/Dave Dykstra figured out additional changes required to ensure this works properly; waiting on LIGO testing results before production deployment. We will be releasing 1.11 when it is ready.
   * New CA Distribution 1.12 Today
   * TWiki Google Analytics Added 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Gratia Accounting service moving to new hardware on Thursday, Feb 18 2010 09:00 Central*
      * Data collection and DB updates will be suspended to allow a copy of the live DB. Reports will still be available at this time, but obviously will not include data not received. This procedure is expected to take 4-6 hours, during which time,  data will be backlogged by probes and sent when service resumes.
      * On Thursday, Feb 25 2010 (Time??), the migration will occur. Since this will involve a migration of service IPs to the already set-up and operating new systems, the outage for each service is expected to be under 5 minutes barring unforeseen circumstances. Any probes attempting to contact during this time will backlog the data and re-send as before upon resumption of service. In addition, Gratia proposes to retire the unused "GRATIA-ITB-OSG-PERM" service at this time. 
      * The upgrade is expected to result in a significant increase in performance. 
      * The nightly reports should have already gone out before the upgrades, people should only notice if checking their probes that the records will not be sent during the upgrade. 
      * Chris is requesting a degraded service/partial outage option from OIM downtime schedule.
   * *GOC-TX*
      * With USATLAS RT: Further ongoing testing .. No ETA yet on move to new system because of production upgrade freeze
      * With FNAL Remedy: Continue new web service based GOC-FNAL ticket exchange work once GOC gets FNAL system access
   * *GOC Debian repo*: If LIGO testing succeeds, then deploy CA-dist 1.11 to production 
   * *Internal System Improvements*: GOC will continue working on improvement monitoring its own services, etc. through this month

---+++ WLCG Items
   * Retest of the GGUS ALARM Mechanisms Monday morning
   * Some corrupted messages for RSV records to WLCG. ActiveMQ bug opened. 

---++ Engage (Mats, John, Chris)

12 users utilized 37 sites;

50352 jobs total (39070 / 11282 = 77.6% success);

184484.5 wall clock hours total (166587.8 / 17896.7 = 90.3% success);

We will not be able to make the call today due to a conflicting workshop.
