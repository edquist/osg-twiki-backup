---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC was not productive every day last week, but still delivered about 250pb-1 luminosity to ATLAS. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now is 2.55fb-1. 
      * US ATLAS production during the week continue to be not very stable, with mixture of simulation and reprocessing activities. Nevertheless the reprocessing progress is quite good, without problems. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 3.0M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 78%. 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 860K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300TB~400TB last week at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites
         * GLOW VO: work in progress on MWT2/UTA/WT2, other T1/T2 sites already support it.

   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 2 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * 50000 job dag submitted to frontend, running over 32 OSG sites, continually cleaning up file system that fills up on daily basis
   * Resubmitted 5 work-flows via Corral glidein service after cleaning up directories on hadoop file system


---++ OSG Operations (Rob Q.)
---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3k3lqjh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/08/network-outage-at-indiana-university.html][Network outage]] 16:15-18:35 16/Aug. All services were unavailable during this period. All services continued to run during the outage, no action by GOC to recover was required.
      * Tracked to Human error in Institutional DNS. 
      * Weekly Availability should be reduced by 1.39% due to the network outage experienced 16/Aug
      * Monthly Availability will be reduced by 0.32% due to the network outage experienced 16/Aug
   * ITB release
      * Moved several ITB services to new hardware, frees up a host.
   * New OSG CA Package Removing Syrian CA which is not responding
   * RPM repository, [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RPMRepositoryPlan][some ideas]] are being discussed.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Lost power to GCC-B facility from 8/16/2011 20:45 to 8/17/2011 13:30.  OSG Gratia reporting services failed over as scheduled but the daily reports (which run from cron) did not get E-mailed out that day.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Installed itb factory instance at glidein-itb.grid.iu.edu

---+++ Operations This Week
   * TWiki moves to Bloomington host.
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/08/goc-service-update-tuesday-august-23rd.html][release note]]
      * RSV-SAM Uploader, Minor update to the logging & monitoring script
      * Gratiaweb, Updated graphtool RPM, ticket: [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/METRICS-3][METRICS-3]]
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * We will mirror the UCSD factory configuration into the itb factory, we will announce as soon as it is ready for itb testing
