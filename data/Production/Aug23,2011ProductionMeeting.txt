---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC was not productive every day last week, but still delivered about 250pb-1 luminosity to ATLAS. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now is 2.55fb-1. 
      * US ATLAS production during the week continue to be not very stable, with mixture of simulation and reprocessing activities. Nevertheless the reprocessing progress is quite good, without problems. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 3.0M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 78%. 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 860K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300TB~400TB last week at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites
         * GLOW VO: work in progress on MWT2/UTA/WT2, other T1/T2 sites already support it.
