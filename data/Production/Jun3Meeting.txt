---++ Notes:
   * Brian B. dialed in and answered questions about Hadoop
      * Most important aspect of Hadoop is the reliability that it offers
      * Hadoop does not have the same capabilities as XRootD as far as enabling jobs to run on nodes where key data-blocks are local.
         * Would be good if the Root group could perhaps work with Hadoop as they have in the past with XRootD
         * This is not an effort of the T3 group, but if we could encourage the effort and help get it off the ground, that would be helpful.
   * Will continue action items from last week listed above.
