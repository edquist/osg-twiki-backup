      * gratiaweb updates
      * TX housekeeping
      * OS updates with reboots.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * We had a disk fail on the OSG gratia database machine.  It was a raid10 mirror and within a couple of hours of that disk failing the mirrored disk start getting errors reading sectors on the disk.  This caused database corruption and we lost the filesystem.
      * We provisioned a new SLF6 mysql 5.1 machine and restored the database to it.  There were a few issues initially getting this setup to work but we did get that up by Thursday.  It became clear that there were performance issues and we tried tuning a few variables related to memory heap sizes but by Friday evening the database was backed up again.
      * The database group here at Fermilab is working with Mysql consultants at the RDX consulting company to optimize the performance so queries don't pile up as they're doing now.  We're hoping these guys are expert enough that we'll get fast results.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Applied Tony's patch to fix HTCondorCE support for glideinWMS v3_2_4 on GOC-ITB, confirmed it works.

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

It has been a challenging week due to the Gratia DB outage; we are unable to see if our users are getting the needed production levels.  

As follow-up from the 2014 OSG AHM we are in contact with two potential OSG users.  

   * Zhiyong Zhang is part of the Stanford Research  Computing Center which is lead by Ruth Marinshaw and he is interested in exploring the use of OSG for Stanford researchers; we have redirected him to get an OSG-Connect account as a path for becoming familiar with OSG.

   * Santosh Suram is a researcher at Caltech/JCAP and he gave a presentation at the OSG AHM on their work with fast protyping and selection of materials.  OSG User Support is working with him to explore the feasibility of running his application on OSG; we are setting him up as an OSG-Direct user on the OSG-XD submit node.
