---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/ct2mfy6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * ITB release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2013/05/goc-service-update-tuesday-may-28th-at.html][Release note]]
   * OS updates, reboots required.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgrade UCSD and CERN to use glideinwms official 2_7_1 release.  Plan to upgrade GOC factory to 2_7_1 on next production window.
      * Continue to ensure running 64 bit HTCondor as default for glideins is working as expected at UCSD and will make 64 bit the default at other factories next production window.


---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release
      * IU operated github outage made service update for display.grid.iu.edu impossible. [[http://itnotices.iu.edu/notice.aspx?id=32332][All available information]] is in the link. Display is the only service using github but change from current SVN repository is being considered.
      * tomcat on OIM did not restart automatically. Problem fixed.
   * OS updates, reboots required
   * Memory increased from 48 to 144 GB on osg-xsede
   * At the request of the Fermilab admins, we have configured the UCSD and GOC factories to require that multi-user pilots going to Fermilab use glexec. This has the effect of enforcing FNAL's glexec policy at the factory level. From now on, multi-user pilots will not be sent to Fermilab that do not use glexec. This change will not affect CMS pilots.
   * Power outage scheduled (4/Jun 8:00-5:00 EDT) for part of the Bloomington data center. Should not affect GOC services but we will  be standing by. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2013/05/power-maintenance-in-indiana-university.html][Announcement]] was made.
