---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 7-8K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. Reprocessing sample in preparation to validate the sites.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1158K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1164K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 166K jobs per day
         * failed 71K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 94%,  walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. Ganglia routine check in place, needs script update to check SE info.
      * GOC ticket 7798: Solved.  

---++ LIGO (Britta)
---+++ Einstein at Home

   *  NEW FORMAT   (?)
This weeks Gratia reports show 4 users utilizing 38 sites compared to last week's 31 sites. 52218 jobs were completed with 86.2% success rate. This is a 48 % increase form last week. Wall clock hour consumption lies at 423634.2 with 95.1% success rate. Einstein at Home reports 867,960.74835 recent average credits (RAC) which keeps the Caltech Open Science grid team at rank three in the list of top participants this week. The rank based on accumulated credits stays at 11.  
Work is progressing to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace. Otherwise LIGO is utilizing all the cpu cycles that are available on operational grid resources that support LIGO.
Ten GOC tickets are open for LIGO. For details please see:  https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/navigator.

   * OLD FORMAT

   * Gratia reports:
      * 4 users utilized 38 sites
      * 52218 jobs total (45026 / 7192 = 86.2% success)
      * 423634.2 wall clock hours total (402913.4 / 20720.8 = 95.1% success
      * Last week: 5 users utilized 31 sites
      * 35221 jobs total (29847 / 5374 = 84.7% success)
      * 289669.3 wall clock hours total (260581.5 / 29087.8 = 90.0% success)
 
   * E@H reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 702,805.33843
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 3 (+0)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 11 (+0)
   
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace
   * Running up to capacity on all other operational sites
   * Ten GOC tickets are currently open for LIGO.
 
---+++ Binary Inspiral
   * small test work-flow fails
   * ff-grid.unl.edu resolves its own hostname to the internal address, that causes transfer of executable to fail
   * waiting for fix
 
---++ Engage (John, Chris)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Started ITB cycle
      * Plan to complete before Christmas
      * Minimal changes
   * Progress on ITB/Panda test infrastructure
      * Have basic testing jobs running on UC_ITB site / proof of concept 
      * Working on adding further sites
      * Expanding testing to encompass a simple example job (transfer from se/computation/transfer out to SE)
