---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)


---++ LIGO (Britta)
---+++ Einstein at Home

   *  NEW FORMAT   (?)
This weeks Gratia reports show 4 users utilizing 38 sites compared to last week's 31 sites. 52218 jobs were completed with 86.2% success rate. This is a 48 % increase form last week. Wall clock hour consumption lies at 423634.2 with 95.1% success rate. Einstein at Home reports 867,960.74835 recent average credits (RAC) which keeps the Caltech Open Science grid team at rank three in the list of top participants this week. The rank based on accumulated credits stays at 11.  
Work is progressing to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace. Otherwise LIGO is utilizing all the cpu cycles that are available on operational grid resources that support LIGO.
Ten GOC tickets are open for LIGO. For details please see:  https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/navigator.

---+++ Binary Inspiral
   * small test work-flow fails
   * ff-grid.unl.edu resolves its own hostname to the internal address, that causes transfer of executable to fail
   * waiting for fix
