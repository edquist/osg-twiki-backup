---++ Significant/Action Items:
   * Next meeting is targeted for Sep 9
   * Arranged for an Atlas specific meeting to discuss documentation on Aug 27
   * Documentation needed for cluster management solutions (Marco/Dan/Alina?)
   * Rob to connect with one of Tanya's SEs (and run STEP09 tests) for file system comparisons (Rob/Tanya)

---++ Attendees: 
   * Rob S.,Tanya, Marco, Doug, Rik, Dan

---++ Notes:
   * Dan discussed the role of OSG in supporting T3s
      * OSG to add support for cluster configurations (previously OSG stack assumed a cluster already installed)
      * OSG exploring ways to build a social networking environment for T3s to get help and help themselves
      * OSG to add security docs and support for T3s (partially completed and used at the Sys Admin meeting)
      * OSG will not provide VM support at this time since this is outside of our expertise
   * It became apparent that there is no clear documentation on how to set up clusters for CMS or Atlas
      * Since some successful sites are using a ROCKS deployment, one config using ROCKS + Condor would be helpful
      * Also a guide for installing a Condor cluster directly from the VDT stack (?) would be helpful
      * Plan to find/develop these docs (Rob S agreed to help test when this is done)
   * Notes from Doug B. (via email)
      * Work continues on making VM's that contain Tier 3 services (condor, gridftp, xrootd, Bestman gateway etc).  
      * Our baseline is Xen Hypervisor and VMWare hypervisor.
      * the VM's will be SL 5.3 64bit and OS included in CERN VM. 
      * We have agreed to use the OSG/VDT cache's, Atlas code repositories and CERN VM cach
