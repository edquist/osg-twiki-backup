---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * 235 khour/day. 91% success rate
   * Much of that: WMAgent scale-testing and Monte Carlo production
   * Machine luminosity took another jump forward up to 25x25 bunches; last weekend got 125 nb^-1 delivered (roughly 25% increase in dataset)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * After the technical stop LHC is back with quite improved luminosity. During the week period ATLAS doubled the collected luminosity (to 700 nb-1).Production was low at the beginning of the week and picked up to normal level of average 8-9k running jobs. Event generation of the new simulation campaign is going on. Will be proceeded with G4 simulation, and then reconstruction during September. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 72%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 473k managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 68K jobs per day
         * failed 56K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 90%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~400TB/day.
   * Issues
