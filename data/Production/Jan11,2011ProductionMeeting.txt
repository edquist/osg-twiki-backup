   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.6M managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 232K jobs per day
         * failed 91K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  95%
      * Failure rate is at normal level. 
      * Upcoming downtime for ATLAS production (ATLAS-wide)
         * Jan 15~17, 2011  
         * driven by Oracle DB upgrade at cern, panda servers will be unavailable
         * BNL plans piggyback maintenance and upgrade to network, OS, dcache, gatekeepers, and pilot submit hosts. All services will be down, and expect to be restored on Monday Jan 17 by 5pm EST.

---++ Engage (Mats, John)

Struggling with users with high runtime and/or memory requirements.

Slow week:

18 users utilized 36 sites

28376 jobs total (21875 / 6501 = 77.1% success)

171849.4 wall clock hours total (155185.2 / 16664.3 = 90.3% success)

---+++ D0 

   * Joel still has a problem with jobs being restarted at various sites, particularly UFla. He's seen an increase lately. Marco suggested that Joel contact individual sites via the GOC to see what their pre-emption policy is and whether they can remove pre-emption. 

---+++ GLUE-X 

   * Richard is successfully running the first major GLUE-X production through the main glide-in factory. He is happy with the performance (generally running at 5-8 sites).and plans to getting the first novice user running jobs this week or next.

   * a few issues he has noted or is investigating: firewall rules make it impractical to run firewalls; if user job has bugs, it produces a ~1GB standard error file--these are saturating the submit host; the last few jobs take longer than eariler jobs (if 70 jobs left, 170 glide-ins waiting). Richard will talk to Igor.
