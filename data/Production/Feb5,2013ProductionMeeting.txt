      * USATLAS production, over the last week, was quite stable, at the average level around 20-25K running jobs, mostly simulation type. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 89%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.8 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 650TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/9oh5bzh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Fifth Tuesday
   * Drive failed on NAS device. Oasis service depends on this device. Repairs complete.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * All OSG Production Gratia collectors and reporters upgraded to Gratia 1.13-8 on Wednesday Jan. 30.
      * Longest downtime for GRATIA-OSG-TRANSFER, ~5 hours. Others were done in less than 1 hr.
      * Hardware failure on gratia13 which hosts reporting DB queried by  gratiaweb and OSG Display at 14:40 on Thu. Jan. 31.  We manually failed over the database IP to the alternate database about 1 hr later.  Machine restored at 18:00.
      * We have approval from OSG mgmt. to turn off GRATIA-OSG-DAILY, going through Fermilab internal processes now to get it done. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, release note in preparation
      * JIRA update
      * OIM PKI updates
      * !MyOSG, removed deprecated code
      * Ticket, internal changes
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Expect Kernel update and firmware update of Gratia machines, HA should keep all services available.
      * Now that production Gratia supports the OSG-XSEDE project name in the summary table, will work with Gratia developers to merge in the project name summary table data from the 3-4 months that it was being collected on an alternate collector in FermiCloud.

Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.13 / 1.2.31
      *       64 (1) OSG 3.x (       9 are 3.1.13)
      *       39 (0) OSG 1.2.X resources (       2 are 1.2.31)
