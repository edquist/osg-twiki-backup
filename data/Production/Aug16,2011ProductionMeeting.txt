   *

   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC had relatively good week (not as good as the previous one), with some cryogenic problems at the end of the week, so no beam since then. Trying to bring back today. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS is 2.3fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was not very stable, at the average level of about 6k running jobs (at about half capacity). Data reprocessing campaign started at the end of the week, with some delay, and actually the simulation activities were withheld last week, in the anticipation of its start. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 3.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 79%. 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 920K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300TB~550TB last week at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites
         * GLOW VO: work in progress on MWT2/UTA/WT2, other T1/T2 sites already support it.    
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : released

---+++ Gratia Reports

   * Current week's total usage: 4 users utilized 29 sites
      * 67939 jobs total (43154 / 24785 = 63.5% success)
      * 376655.2 wall clock hours total (331604.7 / 45050.5 = 88.0% success)
   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 26 sites
      * 57697 jobs total (14354 / 43343 = 24.9% success)
      * 144979.5 wall clock hours total (100903.6 / 44075.9 = 69.6% success)

---+++ LIGO / E@OSG

   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 825,085.96112, Last Week: 755,510.03584
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 2 (-1)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * 50000 job dag submitted to frontend, running over 32 OSG sites
   * unexpectedly filled up hadoop file system with powerflux results,  aborted all work-flows and am in the progress of transferring results to different machine 
     to make space before resubmitting work-flows
