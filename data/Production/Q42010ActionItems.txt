|12| All | Marcia Teckenbrock will be taking over Abhishek's role for reporting VO data on the production call. Welcome Marcia! | 10/19/2010 | |
|11| All | LIGO usage on OSG \ is steadily building back up, still holding rank 1. | 10/19/2010 |
|10| All |  Burt's team completed one round of data comparisons between BDII v4 and v5. A handful of discrepancies were found including a minor bug in the GIP (Burt to send out an email describing this) and several sites publishing incorrect data (these have been contacted), but no issues were found with the BDII itself. Burt is planning to rerun the comparison data script tomorrow before giving final approval to schedule the change. | 10/19/2010 | |
|9| All | Lots of folks at CHEP this week. | 10/19/2010 | |
|8| Mine | Pakiti now being used to monitor security patches on the CMS Tier-3 sites. | 10/12/2010 | |
|7| All | Opportunistic usage back at roughly 70% (LIGO), and the overall peak OSG usage is holding at ~8M hours per week. | 10/12/2010 | |
|6| All | Rob to discuss with Lawrence (next week at CHEP) the need for getting Soichi's fix for keeping the BDII update process from dying into a release version ASAP. | 10/12/2010 | |
|5| Burt | Time varying consistency checks between the BDII versions are needed from Burt's team as the next step in the possible BDII upgrade from v4 to v5. Should have these tests completed in the next few days. | 10/12/2010 | |
|4| Dan | BDII access has now scaled to the point that one BDII is no longer capable of maintaining the entire load. We need to either a) update to the latest v5 that has a factor of ~3 improvement very soon, or b) introduce another BDII server into the round robin, or c) upgrade the hardware on the BDIIs. | 10/5/2010 | |
|3| All | Burt has agreed to allow the GOC to upgrade to BDII v5 once the v5 system has been sufficiently stress tested, and the data has been proven to be consistent with the v4 system. (BDII stress testing is underway at the GOC). While Burt's team was investigating the consistent data issue however, they noticed that there were some inconsistencies between the production BDIIs. Burt's team is continuing to investigate and will provide detailed info in the next few days. | 10/5/2010 | |
|2| All | GOC is planning a machine room move of the BDIIs on Oct. 12. Notice will be sent out that there may be some SAM tests failing for ~10 minutes while the BDII is transitioned. | 10/5/2010 | |
|1| Dan | Plan to have a meeting in the next few weeks with Michael E, Chander, Dan, and Rob G. on opportunistic usage for Atlas T1s and T2s. Dan to setup. | 10/5/2010 | |
