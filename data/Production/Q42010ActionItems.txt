|4| Dan | BDII access has now scaled to the point that one BDII is no longer capable of maintaining the entire load. We need to either a) update to the latest v5 that has a factor of ~3 improvement very soon, or b) introduce another BDII server into the round robin, or c) upgrade the hardware on the BDIIs. | 10/5/2010 | |
|3| All | Burt has agreed to allow the GOC to upgrade to BDII v5 once the v5 system has been sufficiently stress tested, and the data has been proven to be consistent with the v4 system. (BDII stress testing is underway at the GOC). While Burt's team was investigating the consistent data issue however, they noticed that there were some inconsistencies between the production BDIIs. Burt's team is continuing to investigate and will provide detailed info in the next few days. | 10/5/2010 | |
|2| All | GOC is planning a machine room move of the BDIIs on Oct. 12. Notice will be sent out that there may be some SAM tests failing for ~10 minutes while the BDII is transitioned. | 10/5/2010 | |
|1| Dan | Plan to have a meeting in the next few weeks with Michael E, Chander, Dan, and Rob G. on opportunistic usage for Atlas T1s and T2s. Dan to setup. | 10/5/2010 | |
