| # | Owner | Action/Significant Item | Open Date | Close Date |
|21| All | On Nov 4 & 5 LIGO was running a significant number of jobs on the CMS T1, but Gratia reported no activity on the T1 for this period. Dan to follow up with the Gratia team. | 11/9/2010 | |
|20| Rob | A new BDII (IS3) running v5 was added in parallel to the production BDIIs according to the transition plan; it will not added into the BDII round robin until OSG has the all clear from Atlas and CMS. There was an issue however where IS3 stopped accepting new entries after a few hours and needed to be restarted. The GOC team is investigating this problem with the developers. | 11/9/2010 | |
|19| All | Atlas continues to have issues with the CERN BDIIs and Sam BDIIs where BNL (and some Atlas Tier-2) data is stale or unavailable. It is unclear if this problem is related to case sensitivity issues or another problem altogether. The data appears fine in the OSG BDIIs. Action is for Dan to start an email activity with the CERN BDII developers to help track down the problem. In parallel, Rob is planning to examine the "-debug" output from the BDIIs that will show when case sensitive issues appear. | 11/9/2010 | |
|18| Rob | There was an Atlas critical alarm at about 3:30 am on Sunday morning against the T1 dCache system. In addition to getting the problem resolved (in two hours), this demonstrated that the emergency communication channels are working properly. | 11/9/2010 | |
|17| All | The CMS T1 noted that when they tried to upgrade to the latest OSG CE version 1.2.15, CEMon failed to publish data so they failed back to 1.2.8. Burt is working with Parag to try and resolve this. | 11/9/2010 | |
|16| All | Doug Olsen is transitioning to a position with Magellan and will no longer be working as part of the OSG Security team. | 10/26/2010 | |
|15| Robert | LIGO is now up to 90% of its August peak. | 10/26/2010 | |
|14| All | Burt and Xin have given approval to begin the transition to BDII v5. Scott T. presented a transition plan that will introduce additional (virtualized) BDIIs into the round robin and allow for power user testing before incorporating these into production. In the future, as demand increases, this will enable the GOC to easily add extra virtual servers. | 10/26/2010 | |
|13| All | There was a problem with the Indianapolis-based BDII (is2.grid.iu.edu<http://is2.grid.iu.edu>) between the hours of 18:30 UTC and 21:45 UTC. The issue was traced back to a IP renumbering project (as part of the maintenance) which had unforeseen affects on the internal DNS and LDAP. As soon as the issue was identified, the maintenance was stopped and service was rolled back to the pre-maintenance configuration. | 10/26/2010 | |
|12| All | Marcia Teckenbrock will be taking over Abhishek's role for reporting VO data on the production call. Welcome Marcia! | 10/19/2010 | |
|11| All | LIGO usage on OSG \ is steadily building back up, still holding rank 1. | 10/19/2010 | |
|10| All |  Burt's team completed one round of data comparisons between BDII v4 and v5. A handful of discrepancies were found including a minor bug in the GIP (Burt to send out an email describing this) and several sites publishing incorrect data (these have been contacted), but no issues were found with the BDII itself. Burt is planning to rerun the comparison data script tomorrow before giving final approval to schedule the change. | 10/19/2010 | |
|9| All | Lots of folks at CHEP this week. | 10/19/2010 | |
|8| Mine | Pakiti now being used to monitor security patches on the CMS Tier-3 sites. | 10/12/2010 | |
|7| All | Opportunistic usage back at roughly 70% (LIGO), and the overall peak OSG usage is holding at ~8M hours per week. | 10/12/2010 | |
|6| All | Rob to discuss with Lawrence (next week at CHEP) the need for getting Soichi's fix for keeping the BDII update process from dying into a release version ASAP. | 10/12/2010 | |
|5| Burt | Time varying consistency checks between the BDII versions are needed from Burt's team as the next step in the possible BDII upgrade from v4 to v5. Should have these tests completed in the next few days. | 10/12/2010 | |
|4| Dan | BDII access has now scaled to the point that one BDII is no longer capable of maintaining the entire load. We need to either a) update to the latest v5 that has a factor of ~3 improvement very soon, or b) introduce another BDII server into the round robin, or c) upgrade the hardware on the BDIIs. | 10/5/2010 | |
|3| All | Burt has agreed to allow the GOC to upgrade to BDII v5 once the v5 system has been sufficiently stress tested, and the data has been proven to be consistent with the v4 system. (BDII stress testing is underway at the GOC). While Burt's team was investigating the consistent data issue however, they noticed that there were some inconsistencies between the production BDIIs. Burt's team is continuing to investigate and will provide detailed info in the next few days. | 10/5/2010 | |
|2| All | GOC is planning a machine room move of the BDIIs on Oct. 12. Notice will be sent out that there may be some SAM tests failing for ~10 minutes while the BDII is transitioned. | 10/5/2010 | |
|1| Dan | Plan to have a meeting in the next few weeks with Michael E, Chander, Dan, and Rob G. on opportunistic usage for Atlas T1s and T2s. Dan to setup. | 10/5/2010 | |
