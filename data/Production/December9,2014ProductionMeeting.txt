   * The new CE at Syracuse is operational and accepting jobs from all VOs (the name of the CE is SU-OG-CE).  Currently usage can be seen at http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/site?facility=SU-OG-CE

   * In the last 12 months we accessed more than 120M opportunistic hours; the query below only counts the major opportunistic VOs: osg, gluex, glow, engage, sbgrid, and hcc.  But there is additional opportunistic usage from others (e.g. NOVA) which is harder to quantify …: <br />

   * In the most recent quarter, we have been averaging about 3M hours per week; a year ago we were averaging  about 2M hours per week: <br />
