---+++ Release Schedule


---++ Security (Jeny, Mine)

   * Vulnerabilities/Announcements
      * New vulnerability affecting NSS and NSPR. It allows to an unauthenticated user to execute remote code. Announcement sent today. We strongly recommend sites to apply the security updates ASAP.
   * Operations
      * OSG release 3.2.29/3.3.3 with new CA bundle that includes CIlogon OSG CA which is just accredited is available since last Tuesday.
         * Facing issues with incompatibilites between cilogon-ca-certs and CA bundle packages: igtf-ca-certs and osg-ca-certs. A fix was put in place: CILogon CA certificate files have been reorganized between various CA certificate packages. It is coming out today in the new OSG Release.
         * All the sites should install this new bundle ASAP. 
      * OSG CILogon CA:
         * Transition has started. CMS and Atlas are in testing phase, getting ready for the final transition during Nov/Dec. 
         * An OSG CA meeting is being planned with the larger project staff. We need to discuss the needs for the (Subject Alternative Name) SAN-enabled certificates. Globus intend to move the globus gsi clients to use the 'STRICT_RFC2818' rather than 'HYBRID' default mechanism most probably by the end of the year. EGI is requiring compliance. 
      * Switching to the new SHA-2 intermediate CA certificate for Digicert happened last Tuesday. No issues so far. 
      * FIFE experiments switch to CILogon Basic CA: architectural review next Monday. 
      * OIM-ITB certificate has expired. A new certificate needs to be put in place ASAP.
