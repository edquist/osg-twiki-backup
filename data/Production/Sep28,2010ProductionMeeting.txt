---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC finished commissioning on last Wednesday, and started collisions with increasing number of bunches. Since then the collected luminosity is more than doubled. ATLAS production was generally stable during the last week at the level of 8-9k running jobs all the time, mainly simulation jobs. A lot of defined simulation jobs, so there will be no problem keeping all the cpus busy in the coming weeks.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.7M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 82%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.5M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 222K jobs per day
         * failed 139K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%, walltime - 96%. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 200~300TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * OIM adds one more capacity field to allow T1 sites to report the tape capacity info to WLCG. 
      * Intermittent WLCG BDII interruption caused sam job failures on USATLAS sites today, opened GOC ticket to trace it. 
      * Open more job slots to OSG users at BNL T1: no decision yet

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3867342][Reliability/Availability of GOC Services]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3xmsghb][Reliability/Availability of Security Services]]
   * ITB Release:
      * OIM 2.25
      * MyOSG 1.27
      * GOC Ticket 1.27
      * Ticket Synchronizer 1.13
      * Install Redhat updates, including kernel update for the x86_64 32-bit compatibility mode stack pointer corruption vulnerability, which will require reboots (however, we will be using the DNS round-robin to avoid downtime on the services that utilize it)
   * Gratia and !ReSS 
      * System ress02 now has 32GB of RAM
      * Systems ress01 and ress02 rebooted to get latest security updates
      * Gratia database was behind for period from 9/16/10 to 9/21/10, root cause was that an unexpected database housekeeping process was unexpectedly restarted when the system rebooted as part of the 9/16/10 unscheduled Fermilab network outage.  Process was stopped and made so that it won't autorestart again.

---+++ Operations This Week

   * Production Release (identical to ITB release)
   * VO-Package Update
      * New Belle VO
      * New MicroBoone VO (SubVO of FermiGrid)
      * DZERO Update
   * Expect brief outages for TWiki and OIM. 
   * BDII will operate at reduced capacity for two hours (single server while other is updated)
   * Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by !FermiGrid Ops)
      * Gratia machines will reboot on Wed. 9/29/10 to pick up security updates.  High availability will keep user reports available throughout the process.   Remote gratia probes will wait to send data until the collectors are back up.
