---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3867342][Reliability/Availability of GOC Services]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3xmsghb][Reliability/Availability of Security Services]]
   * ITB Release:
      * OIM 2.25
      * MyOSG 1.27
      * GOC Ticket 1.27
      * Ticket Synchronizer 1.13
      * Install Redhat updates, including kernel update for the x86_64 32-bit compatibility mode stack pointer corruption vulnerability, which will require reboots (however, we will be using the DNS round-robin to avoid downtime on the services that utilize it)
   * Gratia and !ReSS 
      * System ress02 now has 32GB of RAM
      * Systems ress01 and ress02 rebooted to get latest security updates
      * Gratia database was behind for period from 9/16/10 to 9/21/10, root cause was that an unexpected database housekeeping process was unexpectedly restarted when the system rebooted as part of the 9/16/10 unscheduled Fermilab network outage.  Process was stopped and made so that it won't autorestart again.

   * Production Release (identical to ITB release)
   * VO-Package Update
      * New Belle VO
