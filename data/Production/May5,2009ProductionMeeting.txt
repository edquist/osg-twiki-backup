During the last week US sites were running MC simulation jobs. The 
production was quite stable at the level of 6k running jobs.

From Gratia report: USATLAS sites ran 903K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 

From World-wide Panda production report (real jobs) : 
   * completed successfully 643,635 managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs
   * average ~91,947 jobs per day
   * failed   163,191  jobs
   * average efficiency:
      * jobs     - 79.8%
      * walltime - 93.5%

The CPU efficiency is higher last week because the reprocessing exercise has stopped. 

No particular site issues to report.

Panda server setup at CERN : Beginning of the next week (May 11) Panda for US clouds will migrate to
Oracle database.

Condor team provided us with a new grid monitor binary, which is running in our production now.
