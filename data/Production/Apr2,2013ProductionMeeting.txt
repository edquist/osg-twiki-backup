---++ Attendees:  

---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 17,110 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~307 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS production over the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 20-26K running jobs, mostly simulation type. Many new simulation tasks were defined, so some relative slowdown in recent production rate must be over.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.8M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 85%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.4 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around ~700TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * USATLAS working on providing opportunistic resources to more VOs, on more USATLAS sites.  
   * Issues

   * !XRootD fire today
      * EPEL released xrootd-3.3.1 in early March
      * Breaks OSG updates of installs that include xrootd-server (but *not* fresh installs)
      * Have a workaround for now
      * Will update OSG !XRootD package ASAP
      * Will improve automated testing to avoid this kind of problem in the future

   * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3116][Release 3.1.16]] today
      * LSF fixes (lsf.pm, osg-configure, Gratia probe, etc.)
      * OSG PKI tools version 1.1
      * New =osg-ca-scripts=, which works in RPMs and tarballs
      * Update vo-client with VO data (v44 from last week)
      * Small fix to =osg-ca-certs-updater=

   * [[Documentation.Release3.Java6Migration_draft][Java migration from Oracle JDK 6]]
      * This week: Building and rebuilding some packages
      * Next week: Round 2 of testing (more thorough)
      * ~2 weeks? Beta testing (osg-upcoming-testing)

   * [[SoftwareTeam.NonRootClients][Non-root client installs]]
      * Will make new tarballs corresponding to 3.1.16 release
      * Plan to announce a beta test tomorrow
      * Still aiming for a release by end of April

   * Other projects
      * SLURM support (Suchandra)
      * Hadoop 2.0
      * HTCondor RPM work
      * HTCondor-CE


---++ Integration (Suchandra)

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
In the last 2 weeks, vo=osg has been able to access an average of 193K hours per day; the peak was 380K hours.  We want to thank the many sites who have provided these cycles:

Tusker, MWT2, red-gateway, Nebraska, PNNL_OSG, GridUNESP, UCSDT2, SPRACE, SMU, CIT_CMS_T2, Firefly, Purdue, BNL_ATLAS, TTU_ANTAEUS, MIT_CMS, and many others

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Emergencies/Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * Gsi-ssh vulnerability is reported. Moderate level vulnerability. users can switch identities by exploiting a memory bug. The PermitPAMUserChange option must be turned on for the exploit to happen. This is by default turned off. Advisory said this option is used in association with MyProxy. we are checking if the osg services such as oasis-login and software packages have this option enabled or not.
   * Operations
      * User jobs without certificates. Traceability requirements. Did a security exercise with OSG-XSEDE frontend. Went successful. Initially they were able to easily find out the list of users who have submitted jobs to a worker node at a given time frame. Upon further investigation, we found out that the frontend has the capability to uniquely identify the end user whose job is being traced at the worker node. 
      * Traceability next steps: will do a security exercise with a site. Goals are to understand how does a site detect, monitor and identify a problem job. can they provide the information needed by glideinwms factory and frontend to trace it back to the user. We emailed nebraska site and asked for help. 
      * CIlogon Basic usage at U of Wisconsin. U of Wisconsin is fully functional with CIlogon Basic CA and also provides a command line tool for users. Glow VO is very interested in using this for end users submitting jobs to Fermilab. Security team set up a test machine at Fermilab for Zach Miller to test the workflow end-end. We also gathered the next steps form Fermilab security team to move this into production if Glow VO decide to request that. 
      * Oasis/cvmfs security assessment. Fully completed. Will upload to docdb and send to ET and area coordinators. 
      * We promised April as the beginning of sha-2 tests. Brian and Suchandra got their personal certs to test. Anyone else. The software team? The sceurity team is reday to provdie the test certs form DigiCert.
