---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Availability metrics for the last week 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/y9ctxkg][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]]
         * On April 1st, [[http://tinyurl.com/ybrpc29][both the OSG and the WLCG BDIIs on both is1 and is2 were claimed to be down by GOC's RSV monitoring as shown on MyOSG's status history]] -- GOC found a bug in the RSV probe's sorting of dates that manifested itself around 00:00 UTC on April 1st (Unintended subconscious all-fools day prank on self?!); the bug has been fixed; NOTE: Since this was not a real outage there were no alerts sent out to GOC staff by our alerting mechanism
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/y9p67ng][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * *Production release*: See [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-march-30th.html][blog]] for more details -- Complete

   * *[[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/03/osg-106-update-announcement.html][OSG 1.0.6 released]]*

 
---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * GGUS
         * USCMS had question about origin of alarm tickets from training/ITB systems; We had contacted GGUS admins about this...
            * GGUS developers test alarm mechanism to US-T1 sites after each production release (usually last Wednesday of each month); changes in release date, if any, are announced in advance.
            * GGUS developers may occasionally create alarm tickets on GGUS-Train but these tickets do *not* send a text message to the relevant party; however these tickets will create corresponding GOC-Ticket-ITB tickets, and consequently corresponding support center tickets (for example: on BNL's production RT system)
      * BNL RT
         * GOC testing the deployment; we are close to declaring this ready for real production tickets.
         * [[http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AQGl_1gJKDWDZGY5ZnR6anZfMjFmMmpzZmc1cA&hl=en#Transition_from_email_based_ex_7272405605382354][GOC-TX  section with detailed transition proposal]]
      * FNAL Remedy
         * Further connections issues and problem with web service interface reported to Remedy developers; Not high priority at FNAL
      * We urge everyone to move to using using GOC-TX -- contact GOC if you do ticket exchange with us! (In the near future, we will also start initiating contacts to our ticket exchange collaborators]
         * GOC discussing this with several support centers since last week - stay tuned
   * *Reminder*: GOC Ticket emails will begin to appear from osg [at] tick.globalnoc.iu.edu instead of of osg [at] tick-indy.globalnoc.iu.edu -- starting mid April.
      * GOC working with collaborating SCs that do ticket exchange to try to ensure nothing breaks

10 users utilized 35 sites

35003 jobs total (19186 / 15817 = 54.8% success)

37152.4 wall clock hours total (33600.6 / 3551.8 = 90.4% success)

Low job success is because a user submitted a 64 bit executable to 32 bit sites.
