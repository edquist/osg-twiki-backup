      * US ATLAS production during the last week was mostly stable, at the average level around 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 730K pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 81%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around ~500TB/day at BNL T1.

   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/09/goc-service-update-tuesday-september_19.html][release note]]
   * OSG-XSEDE failed, /var filled. A large number of !GridFtp operations and an excessive logging level to blame. Detected by operations munin monitoring infrastructure. Problem has been corrected and should not recur.
   * Corner case logic problem with RSV-->SAM forwarding. Believed to be corrected.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * There was a one hour ReSS outage on 9/27
         * related to kernel updates, service didn't restart
   * WMS Glide In Factory
   * glidein developers fixed the tarball selection issue, will be added to v2_6_2 which is soon to be released.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, note in preparation.
      * May need to postpone this release due to subversion issues. 
   * Scott on vacation next week, week after.
   * Propose freeze change, weeks of Thanksgiving, Christmas
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Experiencing high cpu usage on all factories, including itb, even when there are no glidein requests.  Don't recall seeing this in the gwms 2_5_x series.  Will investigate further this week and report to glidein team.
