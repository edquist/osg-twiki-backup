-- Main.DanFraser - 06 Jul 2009
---++ Action/Significant Items
   * Follow up on extension of security RSV probe to compare VO accessibility with GIP data and flag errors (Mine/STG).
   * IceCube follow-up on opportunistic storage (Abhishek)
---++ Attendees (to be updated after meeting):
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * Last week the production was stable at the level of 6-7k running simulation jobs. Cosmic data taking at CERN has been finished. Preparation of the fast reprocessing of that data. Staging is done, reprocessing will start tomorrow. Smooth operation of USATLAS sites during Step09, post mortem review.

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 726M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 555K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs
         * average  ~79K jobs per day
         * failed 50K jobs
         * average efficiency: 92% for jobs and 94% for walltime

   * STEP09 post mortem 

---++ LIGO (Britta)

 * ITB validation: LBNL_DSD_ITB, CIT_ITB_1  have not updated VORS

   *  E@H statistics: 
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 152,378.43727, last week: 143,541.10125
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 6 (+2)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 25 (+0)

   * GEO600-1.3.x code
      * Fully migrated to new code
      * Running at 14 sites

   * Details 
      * Remaining problems at:
         * gpn-husker ? jobs pending, no gratia reports
         * red GOC ticket open
         * MIT_CMS, GOC ticket open
         * SBGrid-Harvard-Exp: (Condor) Error in submit file
         * UTA_DPCC deployment fail: svn
         * Purdue_Caesar
         * UCLA_Saxon_Tier3 
         * UCSDT2 (?) app does not start
         * TTU_ANTAEUS globus error
      * Fixed: 
         * STAR_BNL  



---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Currently undergoing VO validation and component validation
   * Reviewing documentation
   * About a week behind schedule


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Engagement (Mats)

9 users utilized 27 sites;

6143 jobs total (5831 / 312 = 94.9% success);

51599.0 wall clock hours total (51543.4 / 55.6 = 99.9% success);


ReSS server move problem: Mostly resolved. Just a couple of sites left which have not restarted Tomcat - we will send friendly reminders. We have installed ITB, and made sure the Tomcat fix is in there. We have also verified the fix by changing the ress server address in /etc/hosts and making sure CEMon picked up the change. The change was picked up, so I think this issue has finally been resolved.


New production problem: we have had several complaints that we are sending hour-long compile jobs to jobmanager-fork. The argument has been that they use so much resources so that should go to a compute node instead. The catch-22 here is that the storage description recommends $OSG_APP to only be writable on the head nodes and mounted read only on the compute nodes. Another question is if sites provide a build environment on their compute nodes. One solution would be to use the lrm jobmanager, and install the software into $OSG_DATA instead of $OSG_APP.
