-- Main.DanFraser - 19 Aug 2010
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg, John, Brian, Horst, Burt, Dan B., Dan F. 
---+++ Notes:
   * CMS parallel Jobs
      * Currently these are multi-fork jobs
      * Plan to piggyback on the HTPC scheduling work when complete
   * Glide-in Configuration at Wisconsin
      * Plan to have the factory up and running by next Friday (Greg)
   * HTPC availability on Tier-1
      * A sleeper test was successfully completed on the Tier-1 but we forgot to inform Burt that it was a success
      * Next test is to submit a handful of jobs that require minimal transfers to ensure the system is working
      * Another test is to submit 1000 sleep jobs to the sleeper pool
      * Two additional items need to be completed to enable HTPC jobs
         * Update the Monitoring system to correctly track multi-core jobs
         * Update the Condor config on the worker nodes to accommodate HTPC jobs
         * Time frame is the next few weeks unless bumped by higher priority CMS work
   * HTPC Accounting
      * Dan B. completed a new accounting probe that will work for Condor 7.5.4 sites (Stable release not available for several months)
      * A project has been targeted for the Gratia team to query the scheduler as to the correct accounting multiplier for HTPC jobs.
         * Development is on-hold until the current Gratia collector problem is fixed. 
   * HTPC at RENCI
      * John has made a new hire, Stephen Cox, who is ramping up on Grid technology in general.
      * Stephen will eventually be available to help users
      * Plan is to set up a Glide-inWMS submit host in the next several weeks and interface it with the HTPC pilot factory that Greg is building.
   * HTPC users
      * Currently have 3 main user communities
         * Wisconsin Chemistry group (regularly submitting 20-30 jobs per day)
         * RENCI ADCIRC community (have done some runs but not currently running; will need effort from Stephen Cox as he ramps up).
         * Wisconsin Chem E jobs - actively running, sporadic submissions
      * Several new user communities have been identified
         * There is a team wanting to run AMBER 9 at RENCI (John/Stephen to engage as Stephen ramps up)
         * RENCI also has several other communities to work with. 
            * Plan is to first work with these users to enable job submission through Condor on a local cluster, then run on the Grid.
         * Greg has identified several more users in ChemE at Wisconsin
   * HTPC on OSCER
      * Site is working well, we often have bursts of up to 100 HTPC jobs running,
      * There was a problem with one ChemE username; this week the accounts have been remapped and all users should now be able to run.
