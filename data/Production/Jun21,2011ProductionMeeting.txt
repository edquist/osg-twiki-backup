---++ Security (Mine)
   * Change request from DOEgrids. Change in DOEgrids CA certificate. Created an ITB CA package release with the new DOEGrids CA. Since the GOC's ITB cache was temporarily not stable last week due to changes being deployed, we will have the tests completed by next week.
   * A security vulnerability announcement. Not public yet. secure message sent to site security contacts. If you received it, please do not publicly announce the vulnerability.
   * IGTF is also planning a new release. We may delay IGTF release (there is nothing urgent for this release) based on the test results on changes in DOEGrids ca. DOEgrids will submit their new format to IGTF. DOEgrids asked our feedback on submitting to IGTF and we found this reasonable. 
   * Certificate migration is moving along well. Scott created 4 new caches: osg, osg-new, igtf, and igtf-new. Caches are ready now. We will create an ITB CA release today which will have CA packages for all 4 caches (osg and igtf in old and new CA format). Then we will have the process tested on ITB and prepare a new production release next week. We will also have to update vdt-ca-manage and the rsv probes.Minor updates required due to new caches.
