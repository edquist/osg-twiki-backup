   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2014/06/goc-service-update-tuesday-june-10th-at.html][Release note]]
   * Software release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2014/06/announcing-osg-software-versions-3211.html][Notification]]
   * DigiCert host certs problem
      * Fix went to production Friday afternoon
      * Verified to work
   * Users were reporting a host certificate issue that was causing the prefix before a slash to be omitted in the CN after a host certificate is being issued.  We were able to 
     confirm this and requested DigiCert to investigate.  DigiCert discovered what the issue was that prevented the service_name from being added to the CN on the certificate.  
     They implemented the fix last Friday.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded GOC factory to glidienWMS v3_2_5
         * Scott noticed what looked like a huge "drop" in running glideins. In fact what can be seen in our monitoring is a bug fix in v3_2_5 where previously CMS glideins were wrongly magnified by a factor of 10:
