---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC operation last week was stable, without any significant technical issues/stops. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~9.6 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 200~400TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * understanding how availability/reliability value is calculated for multi-CE sites
      * GT5 issue with OSG 3 CE installation at USATLAS sites

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
   * Currently cannot get gratia statistics on Baker Lab use of OSG; we need to install/configure campus grids gratia probe
   * Accounting for OSG-XSEDE (including project id for allocation) now being sent to FNAL gratia collector; but we need queries and graphs to get user friendly reports
   * SAGA team (at Rutgers) will use OSG Public Storage as the first "live trial"; they have 20-100 GB of read-only data that needs to be pushed to sites
