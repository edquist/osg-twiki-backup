---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Quite stable running from LHC, with record luminosities during the last days. Collected luminosity for ATLAS 10 pb-1. ATLAS production was very stable during the last week at the level of 9-10k running jobs all the time, mainly simulation jobs. A lot of defined simulation jobs, so expect stable running for the coming weeks. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 86%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.7M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 244K jobs per day
         * failed 66K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 96%, walltime - 98%. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 300~400TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * Intermittent WLCG BDII interruption caused sam job failures on USATLAS sites last Tuesday: issue understood (GOC ticket 9287), further measure to be taken by GOC.  
      * Open more job slots to OSG users at BNL T1: no decision yet

      * 70224 jobs total (35894 / 34330 = 51.1% success)
      * 563704.1 wall clock hours total (515963.9 / 47740.2 = 91.5% success)
   * This  week's total usage: 4 users utilized 37 sites
      * 66747 jobs total (35978 / 30769 = 53.9% success)
      * 516758.1 wall clock hours total (452804.0 / 63954.1 = 87.6% success)

---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 1,197,762.70601 
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 1 
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 4 (+-0)

---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * Catch up after vacation

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)
   * OSG Display 1.0.7 
   * GOC Ticket 1.28
   * Renumber Private VLAN IPs
   * Discuss how to handle Oct. 12 machine room move. 
   * ITB resources currently report to RSV-ITB which is then replicated to RSV, GOC proposes ITB resources report directly to RSV
