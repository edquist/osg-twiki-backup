---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt) 
   * Last week's usage: 179 khour/day, 91% success
   * We were affected by this morning's OSG BDII outage -- how are we moving forward?
   * Lots of high-demand short job workflows on the way (due somewhat to WMAgent testing); the CMS Tier 1 may temporarily become less friendly to opportunistic jobs for a week or two.  Expect job throttles, manual preemptions and the like.
   * LHC milestone: delivered 1 inverse picobarn.  999 more to go!

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)


---++ LIGO (Britta, Robert E.)

      * 1026454.3 wall clock hours total (826967.3 / 199487.0 = 80.6% success)
   * Last week's total usage: 5 users utilized 39 sites
      * 75717 jobs total (47017 / 28700 = 62.1% success)
      * 1042961.4 wall clock hours total (933233.0 / 109728.4 = 89.5% success)

 ---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC):  2,318,979.29049, Last week: 2,316,619.81474
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 1 (+-0)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 4 (+-0)

 ---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * OSG-LIGO  storage task force
      * 60000 files, 12 dags 5000 files each,  LDG->Nebraska
         * 1 dag fails: hadoop file system error at Nebraska
         * 11 dags finished (all with rescues)
            * 2 dags run without major issues: run time in betweeen 4 and 5 hours (this seems to be average run time for a 5000 file dag)
            * 2 dags get caught in Nebraska outage ( 8/2 20:29 - 08/03 9:38) 
            * 7 dags get caught in Pegasus http source outage (approximately: 08/04 14:00 - 19:00)?
      * Successfully ran 5000 file transfer Nebraska --> FIREFLY, run time: 4 hours 11 mins
      * Running test transfer Nebraska -->CIT_CMS: 5000 files, 37 hours 45 mins
      * Ran RLS population 60000 files, run time: 6 hours 32 mins
      * Wrote documentation 'How To' page on file transfer procedure
         * http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~bdaudert/INSPIRAL/FILE-TRANSFERS/
      * More stats are on the way!
   * Tested Pegasus glidein tool on Firefly
      * Run time: 69 hours for three day data set
      * Compares to 36 hours run time without glidein (Test run performed a few month back)
      * LIGO priority at Firefly?

   * We will start testing CILogon CA (A Shibboleth based CA) with OSG users. We identified Clemson university as the candidate. Clemson has the Shib framework installed an running on campus. We will contact OSG contact and users at Clemson whether they want to try and test this new CA. 
   * We are ready to start hosting the new certificate request web page at GOC. We like this to be finished in the next two weeks. We understand all technical details have been worked out. 
   * We identified a problem in our processes. When Doug left for a two week vacation, he forgot to assign a deputy RA. this resulted in some certificates being issued with a twi week's delay. We added this into our leave-vacation process.
