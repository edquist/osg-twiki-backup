 ---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * OSG-LIGO  storage task force
      * 60000 files, 12 dags 5000 files each,  LDG->Nebraska
         * 1 dag fails: hadoop file system error at Nebraska
         * 11 dags finished (all with rescues)
            * 2 dags run without major issues: run time in betweeen 4 and 5 hours (this seems to be average run time for a 5000 file dag)
            * 2 dags get caught in Nebraska outage ( 8/2 20:29 - 08/03 9:38) 
            * 7 dags get caught in Pegasus http source outage (approximately: 08/04 14:00 - 19:00)?
      * Successfully ran 5000 file transfer Nebraska --> FIREFLY, run time: 4 hours 11 mins
      * Running test transfer Nebraska -->CIT_CMS: 5000 files, 37 hours 45 mins
      * Ran RLS population 60000 files, run time: 6 hours 32 mins
      * Wrote documentation 'How To' page on file transfer procedure
         * http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~bdaudert/INSPIRAL/FILE-TRANSFERS/
   * Tested Pegasus glidein tool on Firefly
      * Run time: 69 hours for three day data set
      * Compares to 36 hours run time without glidein (Test run performed a few month back)
      * LIGO priority at Firefly?
