---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * During the last week ATLAS production was at the average level of 7-8k/day running jobs, mixture of reprocessing and simulation. Reprocessing started at the end of the week, and is progressing without problems. LHC had improvements with high intensity collisions and delivered record luminosity over the weekend. Now technical stop until Thursday. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.1M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 82%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 150K jobs per day
         * failed 92K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 92%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate is 200~300TB/day last week. 
   * Issues
      * BDII uploading to WLCG: info size limit exceeded, causing no info from BNL on cern BDII, critical for production
         * cern BDII limit increased to 10MB (confirmation?)
         * some mis-configured info from BNL CE GIP, solved, reduced the size of the info to 2MB now. 
      * Opportunistic SE usage for D0 : mapping issues should be fixed. Further tests are interrupted by a major problem on the local xrootd SE at UTA T2, which is now understood. Will continue and do more testing this week.

   * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 4 (+-0) 

---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * Testing work-flows (one day data sets) on Firefly/LIGO ITB cluster for run-time comparison, Firefly:  gatekeeper crash
      * LIGO_CIT: 3 hours, 21 mins
      * Firefly: submitted 4/16 1pm, still running, all jobs idling
   * Testing dagman ( file transfers and md5sum check) on Firefly/LIGO ITB (1000 gwf files):
      * LIGO_CIT: 56 mins
      * Firefly: 3 days
