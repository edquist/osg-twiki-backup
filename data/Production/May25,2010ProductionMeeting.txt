---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Mediocre weekend, didn't get the lumi increase as expected
   * Job slots were ~100% filled last week 
   * Job statistics for last week
      * ~79 khours/day
      * 189540 Jobs/day
      * 97% success 
   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~48 TB/day 
   * Reported Issue
      * LIGO has more diskspace available now

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC operation continues as previous week, mixture of commissioning and physics run. New achievement is 13 bunches per beam. Overall ATLAS collected luminosity ~15 nb-1. Overall ATLAS production, after the reprocessing, on the first half of the week was low, going down to a level of 1-2K on the second half. Waiting for the new defined simulation jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.3M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 70%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 427k managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 61K jobs per day
         * failed 97K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 82%,  walltime - 76%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was about the same as the previous week, 200~400TB/day.  
   * Issues
      * Opportunistic SE usage for D0 : UTA T2 still has authentication problem. 
      * Request to have a standalone and lightweight GIP/CEmon package, to allow USATLAS T3 sites to publish only the SE info to BDII.
