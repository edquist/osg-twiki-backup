---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
OSG-XD submit node upgrade appears to be working well after two weeks of use.  The OSG VO has been averaging over 400K hours per day for the last two weeks.

In the last couple of weeks we enabled UFlorida and Oklahoma sites for OSG VO access.

Production continues to be demand limited; we are working a couple of avenues to find more researchers who can benefit from OSG DHTC.

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * No new vulnerabilities or incidents
   * Upcoming security drill testing HTCondor-CE
   * Several requests for robot certs recently. Digicert working with IGTF to get their robot cert profile to align with IGTFs.
