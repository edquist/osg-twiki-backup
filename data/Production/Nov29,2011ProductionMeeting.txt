   * Vulnerabilities/Attacks: New security compromise at an EGI site. No affects found on OSG sites. Announcement will shortly follow. 

   * A communication interface to software security contacts is being added to GOC announcement tool. 
   * ITB tests
      * Need to organize the tests for DOEGrids CA updates. This update is important to keep operations going. Working with Alain and Suchandra to schedule tests
      * DigiCert pilot tests. still going on in ITB. We need to hear from FNAL-CMS (Tony), FermiGrid (Steve Timm) about test results. Suchandra has gotten most tests done. 
      * Having multiple tests planned at ITB regarding CAs is an issue. We have limited resources and ITB admins who can conduct multiple tests. We are working with ITB/VDT to schedule them in most suitable way without being late on updates.
