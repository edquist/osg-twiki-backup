The OSG-XSEDE has been adapted to send jobs to the CMS-T1 at FNAL when end-user certs are available with the job.  This has substantially increased the available opportunistic resources for the Snowmass group.  We are still working thru the issues associated with long jobs for the Snowmass group as well as the read-only access, via CI-Logon Certs, to their 10TB archive at BNL.
