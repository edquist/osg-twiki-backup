   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan (to be updated after the meeting)
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 632K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 260K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  37K jobs per day
         * failed   26K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 91% for jobs and 97% for walltime

   * Site issue
      * BNL dCache transfer gratia probe is restarted, after several bug fixes and new query with daily time range to avoid partition bottleneck. The dcache gratia report is caching up. There are still problems when an overloaded collector caused the number of accumulated records to reach 2M on the probe node. 
      * BNL is changing the sitename for WLCG today, from BNL-LCG2 to BNL-ATLAS, this requires all ATLAS sites to update their FTS channel information.

      * Robert deployed Condor_G code (1.4.x) on 17 sites and tested over the weekend
         * gpn -no g++ compiler

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * OSG 1.2.1 released on monday
   * Working on 1.0.5 update instructions
   * Testing dcache 2.4.1 release
   * Testing packages for 1.2.2 release

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Another notification went out to update OIM contact information. If you have not yet done this, please do so. Security contacts that have not responded will be targeted by the Operations and Security Team.
   * No BDII Interruptions week of August 17th to August 23rd.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * pyOpenSSL issue causes problems with RSV records on resources that do not have pyOpenSSL on system by default. This causes the Gratia transfer mechanism used by RSV to fail. This was put into the production cache on Friday evening and announced Monday.
   * VORS was removed from the network this morning and GridScan site verify tests were stopped. Please let us know if you are experiencing any issues so we can help you gather information from !MyOSG
      * Down to 12 RSV-Tickets open for non-reporting CEs. 3 are NERSC and targeted for an early Sept update. 
   * !MyOSG 1.6 is under testing at myosg-itb.grid.iu.edu. See testing request at bottom of agenda scheduled release August 28th. We've talked with Metrics and Gratia, we targeted several VOs last week, including STAR, Fermilab, NYSGrid, and SBGrid.

---+++ Future Events
   * September Machine Room Move in Bloomington September 19 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG. This could be delayed until October 17th if it benefits anyone in the collaboration, the original date was picked with the idea of a October LHC turn up. 
      * ATLAS has confirmed this date is OK
      * Waiting for word from CMS
      * High probability that this will happen on October 17th and not September 19th
