   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 632K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 260K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  37K jobs per day
         * failed   26K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 91% for jobs and 97% for walltime

   * Site issue
      * BNL dCache transfer gratia probe is restarted, after several bug fixes and new query with daily time range to avoid partition bottleneck. The dcache gratia report is caching up. There are still problems when an overloaded collector caused the number of accumulated records to reach 2M on the probe node. 
      * BNL is changing the sitename for WLCG today, from BNL-LCG2 to BNL-ATLAS, this requires all ATLAS sites to update their FTS channel information.
