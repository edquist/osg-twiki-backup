   * Machine Room Move in Bloomington October 17 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII and !MyOSG traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis-based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG.
