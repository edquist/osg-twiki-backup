---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ VO & User Group (Chander)

SURAGrid reports that users are having good success getting their sites online using OSG  documentation.  SURAGrid has 17 resource contributors; 3 sites are already OSG sites; 3 sites actively working on converting to OSG.


---++ Security (Mine)
   * The security controls with GOC completed. Went very well. A few recommendations. Will prepare a report on the results for all OSG service before the July retreat.
      * Other production service owners on this call please take a look at the questionnaire I sent to you. I need answers by the end of June. 
   * WLCG Incident drill is completed. WE did not have any major issues during the drill. Leif from EGI is leading the grading of sites. Barlow will meet with him after June 20th to review the grading of OSG site. They need time until June 20th. 
   * Anand is back and we re-started the certificate migration work. GOC will set up a new CA cache with new hashes. They will maintain both caches. First it will get into IB test cycle and then be released. (2-3 weeks) Once new cache is active, we gradually move sites and VOs. 
      * VDT CA cache (only serving plain IGTF CAs) will also be moved to GOC. VDT will put a redirect. VDT customers will still get the plain-IGTF CAs. But VDT folks would not have run a operational service
   * New tickets and problems with VOMS/VOMRS. If you hear user complaints on voms-proxy-init, open a ticket with goc. I am aware of ongoing problems. These are different than problems we had 2-3 weeks ago. 
   * Old VOMS-admin upgrade issue. What does dites think about migrating to new version of VOMS-Admin? Alain thinks a patch can be made by teh end of August.
