   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * On Wed. Oct. 5 we discovered a serious glideinWMS bug where glideins were not respecting retire times.
         * This allowed glideins to run indefinitely on sites.
         * We put the GOC Factory in unscheduled down time and notified Scott due to it being high priority.
         * We first applied a patch to UCSD and when we were sure it fixed the problem we patched the GOC factory and brought it back up Thurs. morning Oct. 6
         * We removed all glideins from before the patch to ensure there are no more long running glideins.
