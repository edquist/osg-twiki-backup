OSG-XD node continues to access about 190K opportunistic hours per day on average during last week.  We have seen a large number of pilot failures at Purdue and MWT2 which are being investigated.

We are enabling the ePHENIX group (from BNL) for simulation use on the OSG-XD node.

Working with U-of-Maryland staff to get the UMD-IGS site integrated into OSG.
