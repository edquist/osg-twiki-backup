   * Grid Operations Center
      * No issues encountered over the holiday weekend.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * GFS filesystem used by Fermicloud melted down on Saturday.   Still working to get it back up.

---+++ This Week
   * Grid Operations Center
      * ITB week, expect notification tomorrow afternoon
      * OS updates this cycle, no maintenance 3rd, 4th Tuesdays this month
      * Minor changes in ticket, tx. Mostly internal changes.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Will be adding 30 worker nodes to GP farm this week (64 cores each).  No one should notice.
   *  OSG-Connect
      * Report stash is down.
         * stash and login.osgconnect.net were both rebooted (details not yet known; should have more info tomorrow)
         * after a reboot stash does not mount automatically on login, nor start http and globus services automatically, due to a messy dependency relationship at bootstrap
         * made some changes today to defer stash mounts via automounter; hope this will skirt the dependency chain and allow everything to start automatically
         * system is functioning again (as of ~2pm Eastern) and we will monitor during next reboot to see that dependencies are working well


---++ Software (Tim C.)

   * News
      * HTCondor CE overview document is drafted and undergoing review
      * HTCondor CE scalability tests are still trying to push past ~9.5K jobs
      * Working on fairly minor tweaks to HTCondor CE tools, plus waiting on HTCondor team for others
      * Updating to HTCondor 8.2.5
      * Have HTCondor CE metapackages (e.g., for PBS) depend on the batch system; matches globus-* behavior
      * Possibly getting a round of updates to !gLExec, LCMAPS, and friends

   * Ongoing (and no significant news)
      * EL 7: Working on various Java builds for the worker node client; will review progress and plan next steps
      * New RSV !perfSONAR probe &ndash; wrapping up development for an initial release
      * Testing the !PanDA packaging a little, but mostly waiting on ATLAS now
      * IPv6 evaluation of OSG software &ndash; start testing soon (hopefully)
