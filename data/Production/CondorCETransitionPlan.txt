---+ Condor CE Transition Plan 

| Version | Name | Date | 
| 0.1 | Rob Quick | 5/28/2014 | 

---++ Introduction
The !HTCondor-CE aims to provide an end-to-end gatekeeper technology built entirely out of core !HTCondor components. The first version of the !HTCondor CE was release into produciton by the OSG Software group on May 13, 2014. This release began the move to an !HTCondor based compute element and away from the current Globus (GRAM) based compute element. This document will describe the issues and timelines associated with this transition with the final goal of having all OSG compute elements using the !HTCondor-CE and no reliance on GRAM based CEs. 

The transition team will consist of members of the OSG Operations, Technology, Software and Security teams. *Others??* Add someone from ATLAS and CMS. 

SGE and LSF no end to end verification. WLCG still dependent on GRAM for SAM testing. Pin down road map for SAM update. Discussed today at the ATLAS facility meeting, Sal at Boston and Wei at SLAC are willing to test. Training session for support desk? 

---++ Scope

The scope of this change is limited to the OSG Production CEs and the CEs interaction with other components of the OSG topology. 

*Describe the interactions with other Elements including SEs, submit nodes, !GlideIn Factory (done), infrastructure services, accounting, and RSV. This may have no affect on some components but should be stated for the plan.*
*Prioritize LHC sites (Tier2 and Tier1)? Done before the restart.*
*How do we quantify !CondorCEs vs GRAM CEs*

---++ Risks and Contingencies

---+++ Risks
As with all major changes there will be risks involved. This includes but is not limited to failure in the software or components of the new software, security concerns, functionality changes, and scalability issues.

Security Incidence Response Drill - Training for Security Team. 
*What are other risks areas?* </br>
*What are some of these risks?* </br>
*How should we categorize these risks?* These categories should map to the contingencies </br>
SAM... Back end support for LSF and SGE... Adoption rates... Unknown security issue.

---+++Contingencies
Based on the risk level contingencies will include corrective actions up to canceling and removing the HTCondor-CE software. 

*What are appropriate timelines for the correction of discovered issues based on severity?* 

---++ Strategies

A staged strategy of continuing the production deployment of the GRAM based CE as the preferred installation during the initial adoption period, followed by a period of having a preferred HTCondor-CE with the GRAM CE supported as a backup, followed a period where support for the GRAM CE is dropped yet it is still available to the community, and concluding with the removal of all GRAM based CE content from the OSG distribution. 

---++ Transition Schedule, Tasks and Activities

| *Date* | *Task* | *Responsible Team* | *Completed* | *Release Version* | 
| 5/13/2014 | Initial production deployment of HTCondor | Technology - Software | %Y% |
| %RED%8/1/2014%ENDCOLOR% | Target of 10 production sites fully !HTCondor | Operations | |
| %RED%9/1/2014%ENDCOLOR% | Incidence response drill | Security | |
| %RED%10/1/2014%ENDCOLOR% | All LHC Tier1 and Tier2 resources transitioned | Operations | | 
| %RED%10/1/2014%ENDCOLOR% | !HTCondor-CE given preferred installation status and is not the default CE for OSG resources | Operations - Software | 
| %RED%7/1/2015%ENDCOLOR% | Drop Support for GRAM CE | Operations - Software | |
| %RED%1/1/2016%ENDCOLOR% | OSG software no longer configures GRAM CE | Operations - Software | |

Target Sites are... FNAL, UCSD, Florida, Nebraska, Boston, AGLT2, SLAC, one non-LHC site?
Match Up with Release Schedule Document - OSG no longer configures GRAM date. 
Notification to the community at 3 month, 1 month and 1 week before Support deprecation. 

*What is the appropriate timeline?* </br>
*What are the interim tasks not covered in this timeline?* Security Review??? </br>
*What should be the timeline to seek transition acceptance from OSG Stakeholders?* </br>

---++ Management Controls 

At each step of the Transition Schedule above the Area Coordinators responsible for the task will sign off as completed in this document. Completion notice and sign off will be sent to the OSG Project Manager for review.
