---+ Condor CE Transition Plan 

| Version | Name | Date | 
| 0.1 | Rob Quick | 5/28/2014 | 

---++ Introduction
The !HTCondor-CE aims to provide an end-to-end gatekeeper technology built entirely out of core !HTCondor components. The first version of the !HTCondor CE was release into produciton by the OSG Software group on May 13, 2014. This release began the move to an !HTCondor based compute element and away from the current Globus (GRAM) based compute element. This document will describe the issues and timelines associated with this transition with the final goal of having all OSG compute elements using the !HTCondor-CE and no reliance on GRAM based CEs. 

The transition team will consist of members of the OSG Operations, Technology, Software and Security teams as well as members from ATLAS and CMS.

---++ Scope

The scope of this change is limited to the OSG Production CEs and the CEs interaction with other components of the OSG topology. 

Priority consideration will be given to transitioning WLCG sites to avoid clashes with the LCH restart in April of 2015. 

---++ Risks

As with all major changes there will be risks involved. This includes but is not limited to failure in the software or components of the new software, security concerns, functionality changes, and scalability issues.

At the point of this documents creation ATLAS and CMS are still dependent on GRAM for SAM monitoring, while this is on the road map to change there is not definite date the dependency will be eliminated.

SGE and LSF have no end to end verification. This has been added to the timeline and volunteers resources have been identified to do this verification. 

Adoption rates will be monitored during this transition, while ATLAS and CMS are expected covert quickly non-LHC resources may lag. OSG Operations will monitor and publish metrics based on the number of GRAM CEs Vs number of Condor-CEs monthly during the transition, these number will be reported and discussed during the weekly Production Meeting. 

---++ Strategies

A staged strategy of continuing the production deployment of the GRAM based CE as the preferred installation during the initial adoption period, followed by a period of having a preferred HTCondor-CE with the GRAM CE supported as a backup, followed a period where support for the GRAM CE is dropped yet it is still available to the community, and concluding with the removal of all GRAM based CE content from the OSG distribution. This process will be undertaken based on the [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/ReleaseSeriesSupportPolicy][Release Support Policy.]]

---++ Transition Schedule, Tasks and Activities

This is an estimated timeline and will be adjusted based on transition activities and will conform to the [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/ReleaseSeriesSupportPolicy][Release Support Policy.]] </br></br>

** Notification to the community at 3 month, 1 month and 1 week before event. 

---++ Management Controls 

At each step of the Transition Schedule above the Area Coordinators responsible for the task will sign off as completed in this document. Completion notice and sign off will be sent to the OSG Project Manager for review and an update will be given during the weekly Production Meeting.
