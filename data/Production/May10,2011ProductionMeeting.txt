---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC since last Tue was doing beam studies and is in technical stop now.Will be back in operation Thu. Integrated luminosity is ~270pb-1 (same as last week).
      * US ATLAS production was quite stable at the average level of about 10-12k running jobs, mostly simulation. Waiting for new Geant4 re-simulation campaign of all existing MC samples with new software release. Probably will be ready to start next week. Reconstruction step to be done during summer. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.1M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.1M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 165K jobs per day
         * failed 98K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 92%, walltime - 95%
      * Panda jobs processed, as reported by Panda monitor, on USATLAS sites:
         * 950K panda jobs processed for last week. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300~350TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC: running at MWT2_IU an d OSCER, working in progress on other sites.
      * Problem with propagating site downtime info to GOCDB from OSG OIM, reported to OSG GOC. 

---++ LIGO (Britta, Robert E.)

   * Previous week's total usage: 5 users utilized 34 sites
      * 39556 jobs total (14412 / 25144 = 36.4% success)
      * 254621.3 wall clock hours total (128106.9 / 126514.4 = 50.3% success)
   * Current week's total usage: 5 users utilized 37sites
      * 26522 jobs total (23278 / 3244 = 87.8% success) 
      * 116448.8 wall clock hours total (106535.3 / 9913.5 = 91.5% success)

---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 217,482.27536,  Last Week: 271,134.36499
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 6 (-2)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   *  trouble shooting failed 1 week work-flows at FF, OUHEP_OSG

---++ Security (Mine)
   * No incidents/serious vulnerabilities. Oak Ridge Incident has been found to have no effect on teraGrid resource at Oak ridge. 
   * WLCG Mgmt board wants to perform a security drill against panda submission mechanism. The target date is start of the drill May 23 -- end of the drill: May 28th. 
      * We notified us-atlas mgmt whether they want to participate. We have a list of us-atlas sites WLCG security team has proposed to include in the drill. We will also check with the proposed site manager's on their availability. 
      * Within the security team, we are evaluating whether we can get ready given we have a month. We are creating a list of items that will not get done if we decide to participate in the drill. I will send the list to ET. We will also ask WLCG whether we can perform the drill at a later time if we decide we cannot get ready.
   * I reported before on production test of the certificate layout and gives heads-up to production sites that we will ask them to test. Unfortunately this work is delayed. Anand is in India due to death in the family. 
   * I received trouble tickets on contacting DOEGrids web site. The issue is the re-negotiation failure. It only affects firefox version 4 clients. the browser has tighter security configurations. There is a workaround posted. Please open tickets if you have issues. We are working with DOEgrids to find out if they can solve the problem from the server end.
