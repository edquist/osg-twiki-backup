---++ Announcements:   

---++ Action/Significant Items: 
   * BNL has limited OSG VO to 2000. Jobs create large outbound network traffic saturating firewall. Some jobs were killed. Trying to research the problem. Stopgap measure of 2000 will probably be rolled back once the traffic subsides. Will create a ticket and then followup next week. 
   * Request notification to upgrade to most recent version of CVMFS Client (2.2.3) for FIFE support. Ticket will be created and linked at end of call.

   * Job statistics for last week.     
      * Gratia report: 1.5M pilots, 4.2M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 78% (for single core jobs)
