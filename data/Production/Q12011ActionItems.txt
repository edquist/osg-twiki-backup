|3| All | The Operations team has not yet found a way to successfully restart the BDII v5. Instead it needs to be rebuilt whenever a restart is needed. Ops will work with CERN to see if there is a workaround to this problem. However, until this is resolved BDII v5 is not targeted to be put into production. | 1/4/2011 | |
|2| All | The current filter on the Production BDII excludes SE-only sites. It was agreed to go ahead and update the filter at the next Change cycle on Tuesday. | 1/4/2011 | |
|1| All | Production continued steadily over the break; no major issues reported. | 1/4/2011 | |
