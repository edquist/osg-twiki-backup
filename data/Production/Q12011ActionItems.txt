| # | Owner | Action/Significant Item | Open Date | Close Date |
|10| All | Since HTPC is an upcoming requirement for both CMS and Atlas, Dan has requested that ITB sites begin enabling HTPC and add relevant HTPC tests to be ready for this transition. | 2/8/2011 | |
|9| All |  CMS Tier-1 is now HTPC enabled (Burt); Dan to provide information on config.any to Burt in order to start adding the HTPC attributes to GIP. | 2/8/2011 | |
|8| Britta | Neither Burt or Britta received the OSG Metrics report this week. | 2/8/2011 | |
|7| Rob, Scott | In January (Ticket 9809<https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9809>) there was an incorrect downtime recorded by the WLCG. RSV showed correctly that BNL had scheduled downtime; WLCG reported this as unscheduled downtime. Scott to reopen and try to understand what happened. | 2/8/2011 | |
|6| Britta, Robert |  LIGO hit a maximum usage day on Saturday: between 9k and 12k simultaneous jobs; 259 khours | 2/8/2011 | |
|5| All | Due to delays in the BDII v5, the Operations team is working on adding a third BDII v4 to the round robin. This way even if one of the BDII systems is down, the remaining BDIIs can support the full load. | 2/8/2011 | |
|4| All | The Atlas Tier-1 has turned off reporting data transfers due to the internal database filling up. | 2/1/2011 | |
|3| All | The Operations team has not yet found a way to successfully restart the BDII v5. Instead it needs to be rebuilt whenever a restart is needed. Ops will work with CERN to see if there is a workaround to this problem. However, until this is resolved BDII v5 is not targeted to be put into production. | 1/4/2011 | |
|2| All | The current filter on the Production BDII excludes SE-only sites. It was agreed to go ahead and update the filter at the next Change cycle on Tuesday. | 1/4/2011 | |
|1| All | Production continued steadily over the break; no major issues reported. | 1/4/2011 | |
