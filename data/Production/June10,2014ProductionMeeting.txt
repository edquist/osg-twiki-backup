---+++ Release Schedule

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
Beginning dialog with University of Toledo on: 1) using OSG opportunistically for their researchers; and 2) connecting their clusters to OSG.

We continue to experience file system bottlenecks in the OSG-XD submit host.  For now, Mats has stabilized the situation but we need to address the systemic issues.  One possible solution is to move SPLINTER and OSG-Blast to another submit node that flocks into the OSG-XD system.  And the planned hardware upgrade, still a few weeks away, will assist.

---++ Security (Kevin)
   * New !IOpenSSL vulnerability. Not as bad as the last one. Mainly affecting VPN/VOIP applications.
