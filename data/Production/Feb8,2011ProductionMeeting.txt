---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Marcia, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Machine: LHC to run at sqrt(s) = 7 <nop>TeV; long shutdown not until 2013.  Physics to start in March
   * Last week: 353 khour/day, 89% success
   * CMS Tier 1 now HTPC-enabled
   * Requested that cms voms.fnal.gov be temporarily removed from VO package until it is included in EGI LSC files
 
---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC in preparation for the start of the new run period. First beam expected on Feb.19. Mid-March first stable beams. 
      * ATLAS production was relatively stable during the week at the average level of 10-12k running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. Preparation for reprocessing of Heavy Ion data. Discussions on optimization of the data management scheme for the upcoming run period. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 84%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.5M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 217K jobs per day
         * failed 211K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 88%, walltime - 87%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL dCache billing DB is reopen, gratia report resumed on late Feb 2nd. Transfer rate was around 300~400TB/day in the last several days. 
   * Issues
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : farm group is working on that

   * #9899 (Purdue-RCAC), some nodes without outbound connectivity, solved
   * #9901 (STAR-BNL), jobs remain pending for weeks in queue, no progress on ticket in weeks
   * #9900 (Firefly-2), gatekeeper has issues, not a problem since we can use the other two still

---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL

   * discovered bug in srm client (concurrency setting), fixed in new client, installed client this morning 
   * talked with LIGO scientist to get data set recommendation for 1 week science run 
      * transferred 7 day LIGO data set from LDG to LIGO_CIT (concurrency = 4): 2 days, 17 hrs, 46 mins
      * populated rls catalog with corresponding file entries
      * submitted 7 day work-flow on this data set at LIGO_CIT
   * trouble shooting plotting dags fails
   * generated statistics for Glidein runs at USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE3, NWICG_NotreDame
