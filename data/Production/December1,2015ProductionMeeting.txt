---++ Software (Tim C.)
   * December software is all in testing or ready for release, except for rebuild of CA certificate packages
   * Possibilities for January:
      * Add support for extra hostnames in host certificates to OSG PKI Tools
      * HTCondor-CE tweaks
      * Updates to HTCondor 8.4.3 (or later) and HTCondor 8.5.1 (or later)
      * EL&nbsp;7 software (!BeStMan, GUMS, etc.)
      * Update to !MyProxy 6.1.15 (or later)
      * Add load limits to !GridFTP-HDFS
   * Still working (slowly) on eliminating software.grid.iu.edu
   * Building workflow to consolidate OSG CE data to help Operations push on HTCondor-CE migration


---++ Release (Tim T.)
---+++ Release Schedule

---++ Security (Jeny, Mine) 
   * Vulnerabilities/Incidents
      * No new vulnerabilities or incidents affecting OSG
   * Operations
      * OSG CA
         * User certificates request has been disabled for Atlas in OIM.  There is a  warning message for Atlas users indicating that they should request certificates to CERN CA. 
         * No further software testing needed for Atlas. Atlas was transitioned to OSG CA today according to the schedule.  
         * CMS is still in testing mode. Some components from their software stack need to be fully tested.
         * Intermittent issues with OIM-ITB. A user received an error while certificate issuance. Unknown error code, further investigation needed.
         * Fermilab transitions in January. They are in testing stage. 
      * Multiple FQDNs in the SAN field: Implementation for command-line has been developed. It is being tested and it is expected to be release on January. 
         * Atlas and CMS sites that need certificates with multiple SANs need to contact Neha Sharma (neha@fnal.gov) or Jeny Teheran (jteheran@fnal.gov). They will address the request. 
      * New IGTF bundle 1.70 is out
         * Removed the wrong Digicert SHA-2 intermediate CA certificate.
      * DCAFI Project. Distributed Computing Access with Federated Identities. This project's goal is to move IF experiments to CIlogon Basic CA and federated identities. 
         * Architectural review happened before Thanksgiving. Coding is going on.
      * HEPCloud.
Security review is continuing. Reviewing Amazon's credential management process and understanding how that entails with CMS and OSG submission systems.
