      * 7/31/16 @22:23 gums2 went down and the primary got paged.  gums2 is the host for gums.fnal.gov.
      * 7/31/16 @22:44 gums2 was brought back up by secondary and check_mk alarms cleared.
      * This morning at around 7:38am we noticed that gums.fnal.gov was not responding.  Upon further investigation it appears that when gums2  rebooted the OS decided to rename the network interface and the device that gums.fnal.gov was assigned to was not setup to be 'ON" at boot time.
      * Requests started getting on gums.fnal.gov and jobs started running by ~8:45am.  However, on some of the CEs, a service restart was required to get jobs flowing again.
      * To prevent this issues happening in future, we are:
      * Using puppet to setup the device configuration such that the device name is fixed and will not change again
      * better monitor service ip availability (gums.fnal.gov and gums-crit.fnal.gov)
