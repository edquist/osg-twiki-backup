---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * ITB Service Release - Tuesday May, 17
      * Inclueded OS Updates
   * IS4 Removed from RR after inconsistencies with publishing UCSD found, we believe a fix is in hand, will observe over the next few days before considering it's return to DNS RR
   *  WMS Glide In Factory
      * Discovered a Condor-G issue where jobs that get held on the remote site they don't report the status change back through GRAM.  This causes the factory to lose track of glideins that are held on the remote side.  We opened a vdt-support ticket:
         * http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=9237
         * Not a major problem but it affects our monitoring and can make debugging difficult for factory operations

---+++ Operations This Week
