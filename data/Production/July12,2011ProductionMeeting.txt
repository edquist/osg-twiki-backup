   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.4M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 196K jobs per day
         * failed 88K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.0M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * No report of transfer data for last week, due to gratia probe crash on the BNL node. Restarted, will recover the missing data and catch up shortly (in next week's report). 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC: roadblock cleared for SLAC, SLAC should be up soon; NET2 T2 still needs to find cycles to enable it. 
         * Engage: no update last week
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : preliminary version under testing

---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 998,006.72413 , Last Week: 802,186.97374
   * E@H rank based on RAC: 1 (+1)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * Caltech Glidein Frontend testing:
      * Successfully ran a small Powerflux test dag
      * Submitted larger test work-flow, no fails so far
      * Troubleshooting 32 bit install of LIGO code

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * One 100,000 job dag running at UFlorida_PG, UCSDT2, LIGO_CIT, Nebraska
   * Twelve 50,000 job dags running at  12 OSG sites: USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE3, GridUNESP_CENTRAL, LIGO_UWM_NEMO, Purdue-RCAC, Firefly, UFlorida-PG, 
     UCSDT2,  Nebraska, LIGO_CIT, SPRACE, STAR_BNL, CORNELL
   * submit host slow and at times unresponsive, possibly due to too many condor shadow processes or heavy I/O
