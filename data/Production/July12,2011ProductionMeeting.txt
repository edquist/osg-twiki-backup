   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.4M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 196K jobs per day
         * failed 88K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.0M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * No report of transfer data for last week, due to gratia probe crash on the BNL node. Restarted, will recover the missing data and catch up shortly (in next week's report). 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC: roadblock cleared for SLAC, SLAC should be up soon; NET2 T2 still needs to find cycles to enable it. 
         * Engage: no update last week
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : preliminary version under testing

      * Successfully ran a small Powerflux test dag
      * Submitted larger test work-flow, no fails so far
      * Troubleshooting 32 bit install of LIGO code

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * One 100,000 job dag running at UFlorida_PG, UCSDT2, LIGO_CIT, Nebraska
   * Twelve 50,000 job dags running at  12 OSG sites: USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE3, GridUNESP_CENTRAL, LIGO_UWM_NEMO, Purdue-RCAC, Firefly, UFlorida-PG, 
     UCSDT2,  Nebraska, LIGO_CIT, SPRACE, STAR_BNL, CORNELL
   * submit host slow and at times unresponsive, possibly due to too many condor shadow processes or heavy I/O

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * ITB release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/07/goc-service-update-tuesday-july-12-2011.html][Release notes]]
   * Network maintenance in Indianapolis machine room [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/07/outage-notification-sunday-july-10.html][Outage notice]] Actual downtime was 1h20m, all within announced window.
   * New format CA distribution is available on software-itb.  
   * Conversations with ITB led to no change in process for ITB cache. The software-itb.grid.iu.edu site is an ITB instance and no standards for uptime will exist, development of the CA package will continue as necessary.
   * Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by !FermiGrid Ops)
      * Gratia Outage last weekend. Network Glitch around 2:30 that caused the issue.  Took some time to diagnose and bring Gratia back up.
   * Glide In Factory
      * Second factory delayed, hardware required specific drivers not in GOC default install. 
      * OSG Installation Ongoing as we speak. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Work continues on new format CA distribution as testing results become available. Interruptions on software-itb should be minimal.
   * Production release. Minor changes to ticket exchange and ticket.
   * Some network cables were moved, outages of a few seconds duration may occur on Bloomington service instances.
   * IU engineers will perform power maintenance 14 and 15/Jul Indianapolis machine room, we have been informed this should not interfere with existing power. We have [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/07/maintenance-notification-july-14-and-15.html][notified]] the community.
   * New VO Package [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PackageV38][Change Log]]
   * New Gratia version coming soon.
