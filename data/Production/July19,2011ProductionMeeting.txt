   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC had a long recovery from the Technical Stop, so was off most of the last week. Some technical glitches at the moment too. US ATLAS production was quite stable at the average level of about 12-14k running jobs. Majority of the jobs were simulation jobs, continuing the  Geant4 re-simulation campaign. Also small part are some reprocessing jobs.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.3M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 181K jobs per day
         * failed 117K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 92%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 882K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200TB~400TB last week at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC: roadblock cleared for SLAC, SLAC should be up soon; NET2 T2 still needs to find cycles to enable it. 
         * Engage: no update last week
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : preliminary version under testing

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)
---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Power maintenance by IU engineers in Indianapolis machine room completed without incident. (14-15/Jul)
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-vo-package.html][New VO Package]] - GCVO, GCEDU, DREAM, and SuperB
   * Minor [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/07/goc-service-update-tuesday-july-12-2011.html][Production Service]] Upgrade. 
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * GOC instance hardware up and running, OS installed, accounts created.
      * Installed glidein factory test instance to verify hardware works as expected.
         * Defined entry points for UCSDT2 gatekeepers.
         * Configured CMS Frontend at UCSD to request glideins.
         * Test instance appears fully functional with no problems.
      * Moving forward:
         * We plan to initially support only "vanilla OSG" entry points.
            *This means not HTPC or weird RSL parameters.
         * We have to decide what glideinWMS version to use.
           * We currently have the UCSD branch installed. Version 2.5.1 is not really usable, and 2.5.2 is not yet out.
           * We will re-evaluate once 2.5.2 is out.
         * We need clarification on how we decide which VOs/frontends to support.
           * Do we still have full autonomy, or do we need to co-ordinate with GOC on this?
           * Will use GOC Change Mgmt Procedures and Windows for Software Updates not "Data" Updates
         * We need to formalize the change management plan. Until now it was a very abstract concept in our discussions.
            * BTW: We are supposed to get a "test gfactory" node. What are the plans at GOC for this?
            * GOC will provide this when Lifecycle replacement machinery is ready. 
         * We need to agree with GOC what areas need backing up, monitoring, etc.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * New [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-vo-package-goc-ticket-10666.html][VO Package]] with CMS Update
   * Another network outage planned by IU network engineers, Indianapolis machine room only.
      * Scheduled for 6-8 AM EDT, actual outage expected to be much shorter. Announcement forthcoming.
   * OS updates on ITB machines. A reboot is required.
      * InCommon Certs will be added to Public Production Websites next week. 
   * Installed-capacity report on OIM-ITB
   * Gratia Web available and nearly ready for production (July 26th Target)
      * Is there anything left at UNL for GOC to take over?
   * Gratia and !ReSS
      * Maintenance to improve hardware performance on replication (reporting) db. HA should prevent outages, but short gaps are possible.
      * New Gratia Version has been cut, move to production estimated at 2-3 weeks. 
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Setup monitoring for GOC instance.
   * http://blogs.grid.iu.edu/ goes into production next Tuesday 26/Jul
