   * General production status
      * Since June 18 LHC was in scheduled stop, doing machine developments, and this week is in technical stop, will go back to normal operations at the end of the week. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS ~6.3 fb-1. Data from this year is being analyzed, with results to be presented next week at ICHEP conference. Very much anticipated CERN seminar on July 4, where first official Higgs results of this year will be presented.
      * US ATLAS production during the past week continue to be very stable, at the average level around 20K running jobs, mostly simulation type, with high priority to finish MC production for Higgs analysis for ICHEP.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 89%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 400~500TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues
