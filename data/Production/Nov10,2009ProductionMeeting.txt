---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * Due to the on-going USATLAS T2/T3 workshop, Armen and Xin will miss today's phone call. 

   * User Analysis Test (UAT) is completed, post-mortem coming soon. We are running MC jobs, at ~6000 jobs level on USATLAS sites.
   * There was a dip in the number of running jobs last Tuesday, due to the network maintenance at BNL Tier1. 
   * The gratia job counts for last week is much higher than previous week, because previous week's record had BNL gratia report dropped, due to the site config issue at BNL. 
      Thanks to Brian noticing this, it's fixed now. The old records are not lost, will be re-loaded to gratia to make up the old records. 
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 700K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 700K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 102K jobs per day
         * failed 61K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 95%
   * Work to include ATLAS OSG sites downtime info to the general ATLAS downtime page continues
   * USATLAS T2s are asked to publish their SE information to cern BDII, which is on-going, site admins are checking BDII info and will enable the interop BDII option on OIM soon. Some T2 sites will need to register their SE storage as a separate OSG resource, instead of combining both CE and SE into one resource registration.
