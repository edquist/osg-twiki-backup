-- Main.DanFraser - 09 Jul 2009
---++ Action/Significant Items
   * Data transfers are still behind for BNL by ~25 days. This has been the case for several weeks. The bottleneck appears to be at BNL.
   * Should we also explore the idea of reducing the number of Gratia data transfer records to minimize problems in the future?
   * There are a variety of issues that have arisen from STEP09. Need to explore/fine-tune mechanisms to ensure that Burt and Xin are kept in the loop.
   * Memory leak fixed in Globus for Atlas.



---++ Attendees (to be updated after meeting):
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan


---++ Executive Director Input
  I still do not see any data movement/access information from ATLAS. We know there are problems in this area. How do we help Xin find and feed us this information? From the Step09 summary from Ian Bird (July21 WLCG MB) I have the following q's for production and the US ATLAS/US CMS participants:
   1. Real time monitoring of throughput and transfers per experiment tools for site and grid - should OSG be contributing here? 
   1. Tier-2s: shared sw areas affecting CPU efficiencies - does this happen on OSG? Does it affect our recommendations for $OSG_APP?
   1. What are our plans for V5 BDII deployment if at all? 
   1. Monitoring/dashboards - should OSG operations/support be looking at the WLCG Site dashboards?

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Last week USATLAS production was a little bit low, because there were not enough defined jobs to run. It's back to normal this week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 802K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 87%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 325K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  46K jobs per day
         * failed   79K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 81% for jobs and 95% for walltime

   * Now we are preparing for the reprocessing of summer 2008 data. The reprocessing will start from August 10th, if everything goes as planed. 

   * Site issue
      * BNL completed the OS upgrade to SL5 on all farm nodes. Phased out all storage spaces from all worker nodes. 
      * BNL tried to consolidate the OSG resource name under the new resource group name, but failed. Need better understanding of the OSG model and how different services (BDII, RSV, VO test, and accounting) handle them. 

   * Condor-G 
      * memory leak problem in globus/gahp_server is fixed. 
      * stresstest starts this week
