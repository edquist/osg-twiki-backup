-- Main.DanFraser - 09 Jul 2009
---++ Action/Significant Items
   * Data transfers are still behind for BNL by ~25 days. This has been the case for several weeks. The bottleneck appears to be at BNL.
   * Should we also explore the idea of reducing the number of Gratia data transfer records to minimize problems in the future?
   * There are a variety of issues that have arisen from STEP09. Need to explore/fine-tune mechanisms to ensure that Burt and Xin are kept in the loop.
   * Memory leak fixed in Globus for Atlas.

---++ Attendees (to be updated after meeting):
   * Xin, Armen, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Last week the production was quite stable at the level of 6-7k running jobs, mainly simulation.
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 802K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 87%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 325K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  46K jobs per day
         * failed   79K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 81% for jobs and 95% for walltime

   * Condor-G 
      * memory leak problem in globus/gahp_server is fixed. 
      * stresstest starts this week
