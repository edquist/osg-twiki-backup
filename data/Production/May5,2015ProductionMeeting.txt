---++ Software (Tim C.)

   * News
      * Last week still had lots of May release work
         * Restored default phone-home behavior in our HTCondor 8.2 and 8.3 builds
         * Trouble with HTCondor 8.3.5 + HTCondor CE + EL 5; will stay on HTCondor 8.3.4 for EL 5
         * Trouble building GUMS 1.4.3, due to missing dependency on EL 5, but we got around that one
      * Working on adding CILogon OSG CA certificates to automated tests, but may have issues
      * Starting some June release tasks
         * Getting rid of glite-security-trustmanager (and friends) in favor of emi-trustmanager (and friends)
      * OSG 3.3 work
         * Made lots of progress on builds and setting up repositories
         * Investigated switch from glite-fts-client to fts-client in OSG 3.3 – looks good

   * Other major activities in progress
      * Other OSG 3.3 activities: Define packages to include
      * EL 7: Working on various Java builds for the worker node client; chipping away&hellip;
      * IPv6 evaluations are well underway (Operations.OperationsServicesIPv6Compatibility)


---++ Release (Tim T.)

---+++ Release Schedule

---++ Security (Mine)

   * Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * None
   * Operations
      * OSG CA tests.
         * The ITB tests are going well. There are no errors with the software. Thanks to Suchandra, Brian, Horst, Garhan and Xin for testing. 
         * Testing GOC Services. We are VERY concerned about this. GOC has many services that should be tested. Neva contacted Scott 1.5 weeks ago but got no response. We need help from GOC team.    
      * DigiCert CRL expiry warnings. These warnings do not affect OSG. We are not yet switched to using the DigiCert SHA-2 enabled intermediate CA. Dogcart had a mistake with the naming of the intermediate CA and it looks invalid right now. So, that si why we are not using this CA yet.
