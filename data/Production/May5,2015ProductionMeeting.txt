---+++ Release Schedule

---++ Security (Mine)

   * Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * None
   * Operations
      * OSG CA tests.
         * The ITB tests are going well. There are no errors with the software. Thanks to Suchandra, Brian, Horst, Garhan and Xin for testing. 
         * Testing GOC Services. We are VERY concerned about this. GOC has many services that should be tested. Neva contacted Scott 1.5 weeks ago but got no response. We need help from GOC team.    
      * DigiCert CRL expiry warnings. These warnings do not affect OSG. We are not yet switched to using the DigiCert SHA-2 enabled intermediate CA. Dogcart had a mistake with the naming of the intermediate CA and it looks invalid right now. So, that si why we are not using this CA yet.
