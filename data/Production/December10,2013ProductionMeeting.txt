      * Gratia report: 2.1 M pilots processed, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 71%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.44M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week

---+++ Operations Last Week

   * Grid Operations Center
      * !OpenSSL Issue - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2013/12/openssl-101e-linked-to-gsi-failures.html][Link]]
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * 400 GB SSD has been ordered.
      * Tested and made HTCondor 8.0.4 the default for glideins.
      * Performed more cleanup on GOC Factory disk, got it under 80%
      * Began working with CMS to get an entry into the production factories for the CERN HLT cloud resource.
   * OSG-Connect
      * Stash storage outage
         * Friday morning to Sunday afternoon
         * Instability caused by Ceph upgrade (0.67 -> 0.72), combined with rebalancing due to configuration change, and unknown bug that caused rebalancing to grind to a halt until servers were rebooted (would have been fixed much earlier if not for this bug). Upon restarting Ceph metadata service (MDS), the MDS stop file accesses until pools return to "HEALTH_OK", which resulted in a hung mount until the rebalance was complete.
         * Stash mount hung / unmounted until problem was resolved. Users had to submit jobs to write to homedir instead of stash.
         * Only one active user impacted.
