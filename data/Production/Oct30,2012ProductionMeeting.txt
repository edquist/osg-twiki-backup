NoVA has been trying out the CVMFS based architecture for software distribution using the server at Wisconsin and have had good success to date (running individual jobs that access the software from Wisconsin).  They are now looking at moving to the next steps of scale testing leading to production.  There are worker node side work items that they are addressing with help from Fermigrid team and SMU.  On the CVMFS server side they want to develop a plan to migrate from the Wisconsin server toward a service that can be the longer-term repo for NoVA.  Chander had briefly informed them about the OSG plan to host a CVMFS (as part of OASIS) at the OSG GOC.  They inquired about when (the sooner the better) they could clone their setup at Wisconsin to the OSG GOC server to test the equivalent functionality that exists today.  And they want more information about the OSG plans for evolving this service to production level.
