Operations 
   * HTCOndor-CE drill. Finished tests with Garhan on tracing owner of job by pid. Will write up results of condor-ce drill this week.
   * couple Vos are asking for permission to ssh into grid nodes to debug their failing jobs. This requires changes in security policy. We normally do not recommend ssh open on grid nodes. and Fermilab does not allow this at its site. we will find out what can be done to help these VOs,most of them run at Fermilab. 
   * Working with Ian Fisk on SCDA VOs access requirements needs. They only need read access to archived data. For this, there is no reason to get certificates or any other security credentials. We will work with them to ease their data model. They do not want to expose their users to certificates unless sit is necessary. 
   * Testing glideinwms system with aggressive malicious jobs. when we tested the traceability capacity of glideinwms, we focused on understanding the system’s capability to trace users. We did not test it with malicious jobs. Now we are doing these tests to understand how the system will withstand if a clever motivated attacker wanted to attack the system. Based on our results, we will suggest some mitigation techniques for the system.
