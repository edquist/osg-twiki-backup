---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

For the last two weeks the OSG VO has been enjoying 265K average hours per day (11K cores) of opportunistic access for the OSG VO.  In the past we have had peaks around approaching 300K but they only lasted a couple of days.  So the sustained availability at this level is new.

We have discovered a problem in !GratiaGold which has caused OSG usage by XSEDE users of OSG to not be reported to AMIE since November 23.  We are now manually sending these usage records to XSEDE and working to fix the bug.
