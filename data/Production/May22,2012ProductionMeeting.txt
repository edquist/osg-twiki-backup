---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * To accomodate the Condor file transfer functionality delivery date, we have pushed back the Bosco v1 release date to July 20, 2012, but...
   * We are also increasing the Bosco v1 scope to include an admin install that will support multiple users on the same submit node.
   * We continue to make progresss on HTPC with our deployment of dynamic slots at UW-Madison. We are now collecting some statistics and things appear to be working as advertised. We will continue expanding the number of machines with dynamic slots and should be in a position in another couple of weeks to begin documenting best practices for implementing HTPC with dynamic slots.
   * We have 4 campuses profiled now on the deployed campuses page.
   * Brooklin will be at U Chicago on Tue-29-May to visit with Dan, Rob, Derek and Marco
