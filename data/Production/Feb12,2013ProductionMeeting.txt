---++ Attendees: Tim, Rob, Suchandra, Scott, Marco, Armen, Mine, Tony

---++ CMS (Tony)
 
---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status.
      * CERN Management proposal to extend the LHC run until Feb.14. Allow experiments to collect ~30 nb-1 of p-Pb data (initial goal). Allow ATLAS/CMS collect ~5 pb-1 of p-p data at 2.76 TeV energy (reference sample for heavy ion data). Final collected luminosity of Heavy Ion run for ATLAS is 29.9 nb-1 - initial goal achieved. Right now working on reference sample (p-p collisions), until Feb.14 morning. Then 2 days of LHC machine tests, and full stop Sat. morning.
      * USATLAS production, over the last week, was overall stable, at the average level around 22-26K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.5M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 87%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.6 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 650TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues
