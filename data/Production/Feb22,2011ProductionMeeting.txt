      * Downtime info was resent by GOC to WLCG, to correct the WLCG site availability report for last month, need confirmation from WLCG for the correction.  
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : job quota is in place for OSG jobs, with fixed upper limit. Right now the upper limit is 60.
