      * RSV issues in the new OSG release caused lower WLCG availability and reliability for BNL T1. Rolled back to previous OSG release. Needs help from GOC to correct the RSV numbers for the last several days, before WLCG report is out for the month. 
      * Downtime info was resent by GOC to WLCG, to correct the WLCG site availability report for last month, need confirmation from WLCG for the correction.  
      * Open more job slots for OSG jobs at BNL T1 : job quota is in place for OSG jobs, with fixed upper limit. Right now the upper limit is 60.
