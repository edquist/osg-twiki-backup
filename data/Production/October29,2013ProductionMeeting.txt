---++ Release (Tim T.)

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

The OSG-XD front-end reconfiguration has been completed by Mats to a two server architecture; appears to be running well.  In addition, we now send jobs to FNAL without end-user certs attached.   System is able to quickly dispatch work submitted by users and we appear to be demand limited at present; cannot test the full capability of the new system without a lot more work being submitted by users.

   * OSG-XD frontend status: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/OSG-XD_front-end_status.JPG" alt="OSG-XD_front-end_status.JPG" width='933' height='442' />    

In general, the OSG-XD systems continues to utilize about 1M opportunistic hours per week over the last 30 weeks.
