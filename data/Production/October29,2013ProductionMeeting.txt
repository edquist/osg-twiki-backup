      * Incident at XSEDE. Various nodes are root comrpomised. Attack vector unknown. Users username and passwords were harvested. Checked the list of compromised users. Two users also have accounts on OSG-XSEDE host. Turned off their account. Four more users have names matching in osg gridmap file. Asked them whether they had any certificates in Xsede accounts. None had. No affect on OSG so far. Still more information is turning up. 
      * Java 6 has many vulnerabilities that are exposed and can be exploited. In a recent test, we found 43 CEs have Java 6 and 21 CEs had Java 7. How can we convince these CEs to upgrade ?

      * SHA-2 transition set to Dec 1st. 
      * OSG VO started sending certificate-free jobs to Fermilab resources.
