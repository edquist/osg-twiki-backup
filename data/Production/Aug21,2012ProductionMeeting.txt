Problem with failing cert-requests to DOEGrids
   * Jeff (Viewlab) and Marko Slyz (OSG user support) have been attempting several time to issue cert requests over the weekend receiving repeated SSL hadshake errors when trying to submit the request: <pre>
Error: 500 SSL negotiation failed: error:1406D0CB:SSL routines:GET_SERVER_HELLO:peer error no cipher                            
  can't open /tmp/response.16473.html No such file or directory  </pre>
   * a successful attempt after 11/12 failed on Saturday, after 2/3 failed on Sunday
   * something similar happened also in June
   * Marko is sending an email to DOEGrids
      * Is it there a known problem?
      * Does anyone else experienced something similar?
Report about OSG deployment.
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 3.1.7 / 1.2.29
      *       37 (3) OSG 3.x (       5 are 3.1.7)
      *       60 (-5) OSG 1.2.X resources (      13 are 1.2.29)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        0 (-1) OSG 1.0.0 resources
Summary of OSG 1.2 deployment and security concerns:
   * [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgAEBtLAIsw_dE5sVFZ3dGFZcE1wX3F6aXFRTDJRS1E][This document]] provides a summary with security notes and update recommendations (by Kevin)
   * Here is a plot with the deployment status  <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/chart_1.png" alt="chart_1.png" width='667' height='371' />    
   * How should we proceed? (differentiate more the recommandations? group email, individual solicitation, force to update, ...)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)


---++ Security (Kevin)
   * Condor vulnerability was announced. Important sites upgrade or at least determine if they are vulnerable or not.
   * Voms-admin <v2.6 needs to be updated for ca cert compatibility, as well as security vulnerability.
   * Doegrids is providing test sha-2 certificates. Security team trying out the web interface now.
