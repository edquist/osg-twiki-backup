---++ Action/Significant Items:

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Xin, Armen, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan 
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * On average USATLAS sites keep 6~7k running jobs, most of them are regional production jobs. New major simulation software release is still in validation. Reprocessing test jobs are run on T1 now, will be sent to T2s soon. 
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 734K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 92.6%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 244,758 managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs (185,583 of them in US cloud)
         * average ~34,965 jobs per day
         * failed 41,892 jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 94.1%,  walltime - 81.5%
   * Site issues
      * All USATLAS T2s are preparing to go to SL(C)5 platform, in test now. T1 is already migrated to SL5. 
      * Brian fixed the problem of missing BNL availability numbers in the WLCG daily availability report. It is still missing from the VO specific RSV daily report, ticket open at GOC to trace it. 

---++ LIGO (Britta)
  * Gratia reports:
      * 3 users utilized 10 sites
      * 15922 jobs total (15045 / 877 = 94.5% success);
      * 111618.1 wall clock hours total (108592.4 / 3025.6 = 97.3% success);
   
      * Last Week's report: 4 users utilized 17 sites   
      * 16807 jobs total (15159 / 1648 = 90.2% success);
      * 126326.5 wall clock hours total (116850.4 / 9476.1 = 92.5% success);

  * E@OSG reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC):297,240.63604, Last week: 271,826.44862
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 5 (+2)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 17 (+1)

   * Details:

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Released OSG 1.2.3 today
   * Working on documentation improvements
      * Standalone GridFTP documentation
   * Held initial discussions with panda group in regards to using it for itb testing
   * Tested lcg utils with atlas workflows

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Engagement (Mats)

9 users utilized 36 sites;

11810 jobs total (8345 / 3465 = 70.7% success);

33369.0 wall clock hours total (24356.2 / 9012.8 = 73.0% success);

Only production issue is that we do not seem to get reliable job completed notifications from some sites, which results in "stuck jobs"
We are trying to determine the cause, but no luck so far.


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)


---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q. will not attend this week)
---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * ITB-BDII RCA Completed -- see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/BDIIRootCauseAnalysis#Testing_on_Sept_11_2009_and_Sep][RCA]]
   * Some parts of the RSV Daily reports were erroring out even after last week's update. Those have been fixed as of Monday -- see [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7463][related ticket]]
   * BDII basic functionality now being monitored by RSV. I will test bring details to next weeks meeting.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * I'm at EGEE 09 if you need me find me early in the morning US time.
   * No operations events planned.

---+++ Future Events
   * Machine Room Move in Bloomington October 17 2009 - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII and !MyOSG traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis-based server/VM as possible, especially critical ones like !MyOSG. 


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Kernel problems. New exploits are discovered. There are no workarounds for these exploits. 
      * We ran a test job on all OSG sites last week. A significant number is NOT updated. We called/emailed 10-12 sites. Many claims they never got any emails from OSG. We found out OIM emailing query only emailed half of the securit contacts. But I talked with contacts they were supposed to be emailed and they still claim they did not get it. I think we should test our announcement method once more. Problem may be with client side, such as spam filters. 
      * We will send a new update. There are 5 new kernel vulnerabilities found in Red Hat 4. There are no known exploits. 
      * Current attacks detected against EGEE, TeraGrid, NCSA and Berkeley lab. Attack vector uses ssh. We will urge our sites not to use ssh open to external world. 
      * called T3 first. some, such as UMD-cms uses Rocks management tool and admin thought they applied the patch. Our test revealed that Rocks somehow changed the booting kernel and booted from an unpacthed version. emailed T3 site admins. 
 
   * About communication problem: 
      * I requested a log of site admins who have viewed the GOC announcement. To see how many at least received an email on announcement. GOC does not keep logs at granularity of each announcement, but for the whole ticket.grid.iu.edu site. Even then IPs of site admins are not meaningful for me. I need to see their DNs. This is not captured in the logs but can be done since admins use their certs to access announcements. 
      * We need confirmation from site admin to see they indeed read the announcement. We do not have it right now.
   * Security drill is starting this week. We attended tier 2 site meetings, contacted Rob G and Ken Bloom. 
      * Sites have entered their preferred dates. This week UFlorida-HPC and UFlorida PG on Thursday
      * Next week 15 sites will be drilled.
      * We are running our test job on each site before the drill to ensue it actually runs. 
   * Jim Basney has left this week and Jim Barlow has joined the security team effective yesterday. He is from NCSA and will do operational security. I will arange him to meet GOC personnel. 
   * Workshops are being almost finished. OGF workshop is being advertised. Security workshops are being finalized. Doug attempted to contact Miron several times on the workshop issues with no avail. I told him not to lose time and go ahead with current agenda and invitee list.  
   * Finished testing Bestman-Gateway installation. There are a few small security issues. I will talk with Doug Benjamin and Tanya. I read Doug's website for Atlas tier3. I want to test a few things he said there. I think there might be a small problem.
