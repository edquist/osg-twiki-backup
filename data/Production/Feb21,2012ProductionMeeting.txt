   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Alain, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Brian, Suchandra, Tony, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt / Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 11,454 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~288 TB/day


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * US ATLAS production during the week was still not very stable, at the level of ~5K running jobs at the beginning of last week, then growing up to level of ~18K running jobs, and then dropping again to a level of ~5K this week. Waiting for new MC12 production with 4TeV/beam, which will re-simulate all existing MC data. Must start in 1-2 weeks.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.2M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 70%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 800K
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200~400TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues

---++ LIGO (Britta)
  * Current week's total usage: 3 users utilized 7 sites
      * 21810 jobs total (6419 / 15391 = 29.4% success)
      * 14306.5 wall clock hours total (9116.6 / 5189.9 = 63.7% success)
   * Previous week's total usage: 2 users utilized 14 sites
      * 21299 jobs total (7474 / 13825 = 35.1% success)
      * 29612.1 wall clock hours total (21498.3 / 8113.8 = 72.6% success)
---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * Monitoring 50,000 job dag submitted to local glidein factory, running over 13 OSG sites
   * Factory was down last week, problem was fixed by Mats and jobs are running again

   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/ticket-exchange-attachment-interface.html][Ticket attachment exchange issues continue]]. Affects GGUS<-->FP attachment exchanges
   * Next week is the domain switch and web page move. 
      * opensciencegrid.org DNS will be moving to IU.
      * Current webpages at www.opensciencegrid.org will point to the OSG TWiki. 

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/osg-1227-update-notification.html][OSG 1.2.27]] released.
   * Production release with OS updates. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-24th.html][Release notes]]
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * OSG services machines all had kernel updates and reboots
      * Large network outage at Fermilab primarily affected CMS Tier 1 but had secondary impact on FermiGrid services.  As far as we can determine OSG Gratia, VOMS, and ReSS were not affected but job submission to FermiGrid managed gatekeepers (FNAL_FERMIGRID, FNAL_GPGRID_1) was.
      * Reporting name of ATLAS in Gratia was changed from "usatlas" to "atlas", ATLAS OIM registration needs to be changed to match.
      * Continue to work with unknown/unregistered VO's, total VO count now 148 and will drop by 40 more later this week.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, currently almost entirely updates to recovery/install scripts. Release note in preparation.  
   * Glide In Factory
      * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11599][Ticket]]
         * Held glidein limits hit max and submission stops no other vos allowed
         * Increased maximum limit to correct
         * Only affects the UCSD Factory
