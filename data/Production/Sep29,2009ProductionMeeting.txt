---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.3
      * 26 OSG 1.2.X resources (6 are 1.2.3)
      * 32 OSG 1.0.X resources (19 are 1.0.4)

      * in depth topic: rsv-control (with intro to RSV and probes)
      * suggestions for the following topics are welcome

---++ Engagement (Mats)


8 users utilized 34 sites;

27854 jobs total (26412 / 1442 = 94.8% success);

47580.7 wall clock hours total (44023.8 / 3557.0 = 92.5% success);


Some of the grid monitor problems mentioned last week has been attributed to
globus/tmp/gram_job_state/ not being cleaned correctly at some sites. We have
added a cleanup for engage to our maintenance jobs, and will talk to some
site to check if they have deployed their own site wide cleanup script
(seems like this is still something each admin have to do manually, is
that correct?).


New production issue: We are again seeing a lot of "Generic engage user" in
the Gratia reports. The source is probably Firefly (Brian?). NSF had a lot of
questions about what "Generic engage user" meant in last Engagement review.
Good usage reporting is increadibly important for the Engagement program, so
are there any plans or forcing functions we can use to get rid of the generic
bucket?





---++ Metrics (Brian)

   * Known bug in RSV Reports - BNL and USCMS-FNAL is not included in the RSV comparisons report.  Made progress on this, but no resolution yet.
   * Reports based on HEPSPEC are supposed to be starting in October.
   * At least one hiccup so far in the transition from Bestman/Xrootd to SRMv2 on the GridView side.  We've been in daily contact with David and the GridView team and the issue was resolved - I plan on continuing ahead with this.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)


---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * RSV Daily reports are back to normal operation. WLCG numbers may be off for some sites but [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7507][SAM team is working on that]].

---+++ Operations This Week
   * !BestmanXrootd will be removed as a service on OIM this Wednesday. GOC has added [[http://tinyurl.com/nde4sd][SRMv2 service mapping for all resources that are currently mapped to the BestmadXrootd]] service. See [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7457][related ticket]]
   * !MyOSG 1.8 will be released this week. Full list of bug fixes and feature updates will be sent as notification soon. 

   * RSV Graphs: <br />

---+++ Future Events
   * Machine Room Move in Bloomington October 17 2009 - Some non-critical GOC Services -- twiki, www -- in Bloomington are expected to be down. 
      * GOC has put (or will put) in place instances of critical services BDII, MyOSG, GOCTicket, Software cache -- and non-critical services OIM  -- on IUPUI based servers. GOC will attempt to move OSG twiki to IUPUI. 

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Kernel vulnerability 
      * EGEE is asking for sanctions against unpatched sites
      * will ask Ruth and Mirn's input
   * incident drill is going well
      * again VO package update problems, 
      * GOC VOMS address changes are not picked up by sites
      * 6 sites have been tested. all passed OK. 
      this week 5 more on tuesday and 6 more on Th
