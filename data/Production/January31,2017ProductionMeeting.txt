   * Tanya

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin) 

   * General production status. 
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was quite stable, at the average level of 55-63K running job slots. The issue on downtimes mapping from OSG to AGIS is under discussion.         
   * Job statistics for last week.     
      * Gratia report: 1.8M pilots, 3.5M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 75% (for single core jobs)
      * 2.2M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard (~68K from OSG opportunistic resources).

   * Fifth Tuesday, no maintenance
   * On 7/Feb the UPS for the enterprise portion of the IU data center will be bypassed for repair. There will be no backup power available during these repairs.
   * !PerfSONAR component psds1 is currently filling /var at a rate that will fill it in 30 days. Scott will intervene unless someone else wants to do so.

---++ Networking (Shawn)

---++ Production Support (Ken)

   * Some connectivity issues between OSG Connect and FNAL_GPGrid last week, but seems to have cleared up.
   * !JINR CREAM CEs now in production for !NOvA and (previously working) !CMS. HTCondorCE mostly working but trying to track down intermittent glexec issue.
   * CMS having trouble getting to Stampede from CERN frontend. Traced to router issue at TACC and should be fixed now. Also a job matchmaking issue which (should be) fixed within last hour.
   * CENF (CERN neutrino) cluster not supported in current form by CERN IT, so that effort is probably over. There were some productive FNAL/CERN meetings last week to restructure DUNE/protoDUNE effort.
