   * No new vulnerabilities/incidents
   * While building CA distribution, multiple issues were found:
      * Expired CA: INFN-CA-2006 in IGTF 1.77
      * UNLPGrid is in the process of re-generating its root certificateand extending the validity period. The CA certificate in IGTF 1.78 was not updated to the most recent one. CRL verification was failing. New CRLs have been published (with the old CA certificate) and verification is working good again.
