   * OSG considers that having the same GA submitting and approving a request is the expected behavior. We trust the GAs assigned to a VO and their requests. That's why others GAs don't get notified if the requestor is a GA herself.  https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/31172
   * DigiCert API has been disabled for OSG: https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/30812
   * Security training for new VOs will be conducted by Jeny and Zhalak(new member of OSG Security Team) as part of onboarding process.
