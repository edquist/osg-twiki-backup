-- Main.DanFraser - 08 Jun 2009
---++ Attendees (to be updated after meeting):
   * Xin, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * CMS ran about 208 khour/day last week with 92% success.   CPU/Wallclock is 72%.  
   * STEP09 is running.   We are fulfilling our commitments and have found scaling issues with some of the MSS (being worked on).  Tape rates overall are reasonable; processing with glideins are running well with over 13k jobs running from a single production intsance.  Analysis is ramping up.
   * We need to have a discussion on how availability metrics are generated -- we were caught by surprise with the announcement that GOC is recentralizing testing.

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 0.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 79.4%
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 659,779 managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs
         * average  ~94,254 jobs per day
         * failed  112,026  jobs
         * average efficiency: 85.5% for jobs and 91.3% for walltime

   * STEP09 status
      * Step09 started at the beginning of the last week. 
      * So far US cloud was quite stable. No problems with staging, writing, data transfer. Production was always at the level of 6-7k running jobs.

   * Condor-G enhancement
      * condor team delivered new version of condor that implements multiple gridmanager processes, one for each remote CE. We are putting it into production and in the process of testing it  

---++ LIGO (Britta)

                             51427.9 wall clock hours total (48661.8 / 2766.2 = 94.6% success);<br>


Recent Average Credit (RAC) :160,069.4881<br>
E@H rank based on RAC: 8<br>
E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 29<br>

 * problem on Harvard was resolved by the system administrator<br>

 * Robert is testing new code

 * Robert meets with Condor team June 29

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * ITB testing now underway
   * Switched to footprints ticketing system from rt
   * Working on subversion and repository changes to merge with GOC hosted repository and to unify vtb, itb, and production cache management


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Engagement (Mats)

<pre>
2009-06-01 - 2009-06-07
7 users utilized 30 sites;
22964 jobs total (21973 / 991 = 95.7% success);
30896.6 wall clock hours total (29998.0 / 898.5 = 97.1% success);

One production issue: we are considering moving the Engagement
VOMRS/VOMS service because we are not getting good service from RENCI.
We are still thinking about if the move is a good idea and if so, where
to move the service.


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)


   * D0 
      * D0 !MonteCarlo production is at an average consumption of 80,000 wall hours per day. Usual efficiencies.
      * D0 Event production is at 7.8 million events per week. 
              
   * nanoHUB 
      * Taskforce now closed, with key all goals successfully achieved. 
      * With current 6 application jobtypes, nanoHUB's production across OSG has ramped up manifold in May'09, and has been sustained at 600-800 wall hours/day. 
      * OSG resource failure rate is less than 1%. 
      * Link failure rate (lack of OSG resource availability) is nearly 12%. 
      * Influx of nanoHUB end-user jobs is expected in near future.
      * Wider scoped items: [carryover items in last week's minutes]
   
   * ITB 1.1 validation by VOs
      * Schedule in formation - mid-June to mid-July.
      * Expecting 10-12 active VOs to participate - including ATLAS, CMS, LIGO.
