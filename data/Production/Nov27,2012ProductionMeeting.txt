---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/9oh5bzh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * No release, Thanksgiving holiday.
   * Reduced false alarms on CERN BDII, one instance there was configured for excessive logging, I/O bottlenecks caused timeouts.
   * RSV false positives on GOC services, believed fixed, may have returned.
   *  WMS Glide In Factory
      * Testing glideinWMS 2_6_3_rc1
      * GOC Factory disk partition started filling rapidly since Friday. It has stabilized to 85%.
         * Seems to just be increased glidein logs due to high activity.
         * We will investigate more and tweak the log cleanup / rotation as necessary.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * No release, Thanksgiving holiday.
   * Next release cycle: ITB December 4th, Production December 11th
   * Initial installation of OASIS, storage array in progress.
      * Wednesday Target for Systems Online
      * Wednesday Meeting with NoVA as first Beta User
   * Noticed a CERN outage took down ATLAS Production 
      * "AFS problem triggered the whole atlas.web.cern.ch web site to be unavailable for hours, it was fixed this morning (INC:198000). Unavailability of TiersOfAtlasCache web copy affected ATLAS production. Possible ways to avoid it in the future are under discussion."
      * Can OSG Production/Operations Help?
