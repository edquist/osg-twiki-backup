-- Main.DanFraser - 28 Apr 2009
---++ Current Production Team Action Items
   * D0, Nanohub, Engage submitting jobs to CMS sites that are terminating and/or suspending jobs. Need to understand the circumstances for these and find out what is happening. Abhishek to contact GLOW & San Diego and report back with more detail.
   * Atlas -- Throughput good but hitting Condor bug involving GridMon and logfiles that are too old. (Xin working with Jamie, needs to report back with update)
   * LIGO -- Switched E@H to GT2, but now hitting GT2 job submission limits (e.g. crashed Nebraska gatekeeper). Need to discuss a solution approach/plan. (Britta,Kent,Dan)
   * LIGO -- Problem with job status at CIT_CMS_T2. New ticket opened: 'https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=6763' (Britta)
   * D0 still affected by LSF/Globus Gatekeeper bug -- Alain to keep pinging Globus Tickets: https://oim.grid.iu.edu/gocticket/viewer?id=6489 and http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6688
   * CMS -- CMS ran 153 khours/day at 92% success.  CPU/wallclock was 67% -- it seems to be uniformly low as opposed to concentrated at a particular site (although GLOW is much lower as always).  A follow-up on last week's discussion of LIGO GRAM2 jobs overloading gatekeepers -- we'll speak to Nebraska to get Brian Moe the specifics, but I think the problem is understood.  Our Tier 2 admins are keeping an eye on their individual sites and are starting to implement measures to protect themselves.  Unfortunately the only tool really available is turning off submissions for a particular VO outright.
