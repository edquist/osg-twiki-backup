      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilots, 5M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 77% (for single core jobs)

---++ Production Support (Ken)

 * Starting to get CENF (at CERN) set up as an OSG site for DUNE/protoDUNE. It's a 350-node/16 cores per node cluster running CERN CentOS 7 that's intended for use by DUNE and protoDUNE. They already have HTCondor and CVMFS installed, so I'll work with them to get the OSG CE and factory entries set up. They will initially use the Fermilab fifebatch frontend for job submission and gradually expand to other places.
