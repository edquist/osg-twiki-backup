---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
      * Display Issue has been turned over to Ashu. [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9245][Ticket]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * No ITB changes for this week.
   * !MetricDescription upload to SAM turned off, no effects observed.
   * Gratia
      * The ITB and Production databases are shared and there was a slowdown due to an itb site in Columbia that dumped all of their unknown VO data.
      * This more than likely contributed to the Display Issues.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Campus wide network outage at UCSD Tues April 19 5:45 pm to about 7:30 pm (pacific).
         * Believed to be caused by damaged fiber optic connection connecting campus to WAN
         * During this time the Factory was unreachable by off-campus Frontends
         * Igor notified Frontend admins with his FNAL email (UCSD mail servers were unreachable as well)
         * Did not affect running glideins for off-campus Frontends, only prevented new ones from starting in this time period
         * CMS glideins failed however since glideins could not reach the CMS Frontend at UCSD

---+++ Operations This Week
   * No production release this week
   * Request to stop monitoring SAM-BDII at CERN
      * Approved by Xin and Alessandro
   * Will be modifying format of data to be sent to SAM
