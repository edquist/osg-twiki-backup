---++ Attendees (to be updated after meeting):
   * Xin, Britta, Mats, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * CMS ran about 240 khour/day last week with 91% success.   CPU/Wallclock is 80%.  
   * STEP09 is done.  Many goals were fulfilled.  Glidein production achieved 10k running jobs out of a single factory.  Some questions were raised that we are now trying to understand -- understanding how fast we could read and write from MSS, for example.  We're still working on the post-mortem.  Also, analysis efforts via glideinWMS continues as a separate non-coordinated scale test.
   * CMS Tier 1 is now transitioned to an OSG site only. 
---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 0.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 76%
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 773,270 managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs
         * average  ~110,467 jobs per day
         * failed 183,338 jobs
         * average efficiency: 81% for jobs and 96% for walltime

   * STEP09 status
      * Step09 active operations stopped last Friday evening, with backlog cleaned by Sunday, June 14. Quite a successful run, no major problems. US cloud was quite stable. Production was always at the level of 6-7k running jobs. Results of the run are being analyzed. Details after post mortem on July 1.
