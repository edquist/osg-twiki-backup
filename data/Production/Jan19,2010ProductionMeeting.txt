---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)
   * General production status
      * During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 8~10K running jobs, mainly MC jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 583K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 83K jobs per day
         * failed 59K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 91%,  walltime - 96%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. 
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  no update this week.
