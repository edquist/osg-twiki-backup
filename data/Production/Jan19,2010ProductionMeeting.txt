---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) John, Chris, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 210 khour/day, 95% success. CPU/wallclock at 55% (excluding T1: 85%).  I think I may have been summing daily averages for the CPU/wallclock number (including today's report) -- OK if the usage is constant, but it was highly variable this week.  I'll try to make this accurate for next week.
   * Storage: 3.1 PB xfer (T1), 85 TB (others)
   * Current queue of physics simulation results fulfilled. Enjoy your opportunistic cycles for now!
   * Ran some intense skim runs at the Tier 1 over the next week; may be reproducing this week.

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)
   * General production status
      * During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 8~10K running jobs, mainly MC jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 583K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 83K jobs per day
         * failed 59K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 91%,  walltime - 96%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. 
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  no update this week. 


---++ LIGO (Britta, Rob E.)
   * 100k cpu hours/day
   * 8k..10k jobs/day

   * Gratia reports:
   *  Current week's total usage: 5 users utilized 37 sites
      * 39869 jobs total (34898 / 4971 = 87.5% success)
      * 395944.0 wall clock hours total (383453.0 / 12490.9 = 96.8% success)
   * Last week's total usage: 3 users utilized 33 sites
      * 2675 jobs total (2601 / 74 = 97.2% success);
      * 34.9 wall clock hours total (28.8 / 6.1 = 82.5% success);
 
   * E@H reports
      * last day: 1.58M credits
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC):  605k Last week: 470k
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 4 (+-0)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 11 (+-0)
 
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace

 
---+++ Binary Inspiral
    
      * 3 day test work-flow on Firefly: 

      * Gap in data error ticket remains open

      * test run on different 3 data set succeeds
      
      * Submitted test run on one week of data

---++ Engage (Mats, John, Chris)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Working on OSG 1.2.6 release
      * In ITB testing
      * A few issues have appeared and are being investigated
   * Panda ITB framework
      * Have 2 sites accepting pilots, 2 more should be added soon
      * All 4 sites should be ready in time to run test jobs on the sites for current ITB testing round

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
