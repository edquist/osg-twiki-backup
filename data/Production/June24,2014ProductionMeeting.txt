We have recently learned that there is double counting of wall hours for some percentage of jobs sent to FNAL.   (This issue only affect “Batch” hours reported by CEs – there is no known issue for “Batch-Pilot” hours reported from submit nodes)

Quick summary:  Fermigrid CE is really a “steering” CE with no worker nodes; it sends incoming jobs to other CEs at FNAL.  Jobs sent to FNAL via the Fermigrid CE have double counting of wall hours because the Fermigrid CE reports wall hours to the Gratia and the CE where the job executed also reports wall hours. There is no double counting of CPU hours.  This configuration has existed for a long time.

For the last year this resulted in ~32M wall hours or about 4% of the total.  Since most opportunistic work at FNAL enters via the Fermigrid CE the affect there is magnified when you look at the percentage – about 11%.     

Brian has proposed to map the Fermigrid CE to “null” in some Gratia CE mapping table and that should remove this excess from all past and future report.  

Please be alerted that after we make this change, you will see a drop in the wall hours compared to what you have become used to seeing.
