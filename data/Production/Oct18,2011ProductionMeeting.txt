   * General production status
      * Another productive week for LHC. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now at 4.9fb-1. 
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of 12K running jobs, mainly simulation job types.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.3M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 85% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300T~500T/day at BNL T1 in last week.
   * Issues

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/10/goc-service-update-tuesday-october-11th.html][Release notes]]
   * VM moves from IUPUI to IUB: software2, rsvprocess2. IUB to IUB: myosg1, data1
      * part of the reconfiguration associated with new servers.
   * Display update was reverted, older versions of firefox generated strange image sizing.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Power outage went as scheduled and announced.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Watching out for the bugfix, seems to have worked.
      * Glide In Factory One Month History <br>

---+++ Operations This Week
   * We have ATLAS sign-off on BDII v5. Pending CMS sign-off  we will change is.grid to only IUB instances during 1st November production change window.
      * Tony reports testing has gone well so far, but needs more time before giving the official CMS stamp of approval. 
   * Replacement for !GridView/RSV comparison nearly complete. Will start sending test reports from new version soon.
   * ITB release
   * OS updates on ITB machines. Reboots may be required.
