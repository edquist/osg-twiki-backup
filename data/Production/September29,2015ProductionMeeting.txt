---++ Security (Jeny, Mine)
   * Vulnerabilities/announcements:
      * dCache vulnerability announcement sent last week. Update ASAP
   * Operations
      * OSG CA - IGTF accreditation: The TAGPMA meeting is tomorrow. Unfortunately Dave Kelsey is out and cannot attend the meeting. But Irwin will have his feedback ready. We are waiting this evening if we get any last minute questions from Irwin. The good news is both reviewers agreed to wrap this up by October 9th. Irwin said he is ready to vote on this either tomorrow or very soon if Dave cannot make it. 
      * CRL distribution service: Contacted Romain Wartel , WLCG security officer, about how does CERN distributes the CRL files. It turned out Romain was not aware of the situation and his first comment was "this looks like bad practice to me" but of course he will research this more. It is possible CERN may have put necessary controls in place.  
      * FIFE experiments switch to CILogon Basic CA: additional requirements are being passed to CILogon. Support for current services and production schemes is imperative.We are still trying to nail down the Identity Provider architecture that will work best with CILogon Basic CA. 
      * OSG Connect security assessment: preparing a traceability drill.
      * Routine deployment of 1.47 and 1.48 CAs bundles completed.
      * CISRC 2016 Paper. We are submitting a conference paper on our experiences with federated identities and CILogon Basic CA. Mostly describing the work we did for IF experiments.
