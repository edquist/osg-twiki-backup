   * Vulnerabilities/Emergencies
      * Shell Shock vulnerability had an impact on OSG. A perfsonar node in OSG got compromised. Another node had been potentially compromised and advertised as vulnerable on hacker websites. We had several perfsonar nodes compromised in WLCG. 
      * Several messages have been sent out to OSG community. The initial fix was late last week. Over the weekend more vulnerabilities were discovered and subsequent fixes were released. We asked our sites to patch as soon as they get the fixes. 
      * Have been in constant contact with perfsonar nodes. Now they have a patch and they have been alerted to the urgency of the patch. 
      * There is no immediate threat on CEs and SEs. 
      * GOC services are under active monitoring.
