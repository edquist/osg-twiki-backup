---++ CMS (Tony)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * 7,679 jobs/day

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~387 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Last week ATLAS and CMS presented the first official Higgs results of this year and announced the discovery of a new particle. Accordingly the LHC schedule was significantly modified - 2 additional months were added to the pp program, till the end of the year, and the Heavy Ion program was moved to the beginning of the next year, to be followed by the long shutdown. LHC operation during the week faced some small technical issuess, so data collection efficiency was not high. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~6.7 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the past week continue to be very stable, at the average level around 20K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 88%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.0M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300~550TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues

   * No production release this week
   * Software version [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/07/osg-software-version-316-has-been.html][3.1.16]] released.
   * UCSD glidein factory is reporting unusually high load, cause currently unknown. May move service to new server as a test


---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * %RED%Bosco schedule is at risk again due to resource issues from UW Condor team.%ENDCOLOR% Other activities are proceeding to schedule including usability testing and traceroute debugging capabilities. Want to start beta testing in coming weeks including Pegasus group.
   * Should get back on track with expanded partitionable slots capability in Madison and Greg Thain has started best practices document that needs to be reviewed by Nebraska team.
   * Had good discussion on campus infrastructure outreach at OSG Planning meeting. Rob Gardner presented a plan for expanding the Campus Infrastructure Community and start delivering some virtual seminars. We hope to start featuring deployed campus grids on the OSG status map and have a few more campuses to profile.
