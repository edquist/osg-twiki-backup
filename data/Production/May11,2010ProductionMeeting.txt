---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) John, Chris, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Up to 2.6 inverse nanobarns inverse luminosity.  (Still only colliding 2x2 bunches)
   * Job statistics for last week: 168 khours/day, 66 kJobs/day, 77% success 
   * Operations were adversely affected by BDII outage.  Tier 1 and Tier 2s have staggered update times so that older CEMon releases will be robust against hanging collector
   * Dialog will continue on making SLA definitions more clear

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * ATLAS production was at the average level of 7-8k running jobs. Mainly were simulation jobs. Production load is down now in preparation for the second round of reprocessing. Over the week data distribution from last reprocessing was going on. LHC had commissioning over the weekdays last week. Also some small technical problems. Good luminosity over the weekend and yesterday.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.7M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 83%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 843k managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 120K jobs per day
         * failed 111K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 88%,  walltime - 92%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate is 300~500TB/day last week. 
   * Issues
      * Opportunistic SE usage for D0 : no updates from D0 test

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
 
   * Availability metrics for the last week 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/2fnlv2z][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector, OSG Display]]
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/24hmhb7][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * !CEMon collector on is2.grid.iu.edu died on Tuesday evening. This led to issues with BDII resources appearing in both BDIIs. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/05/some-osg-ces-facing-intermittent-cemon.html][Notification]]
      * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8530][Ticket Details]]
      * Issues found with NCSD using CPU time.
   * GOC Services ITB Release on May 4th 
      * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/05/goc-service-update-tuesday-may-11th-at.html][Change Log]]
      * Mostly minor bug fixes

---+++ Operations This Week

   * Scheduled Maintenance of is2
      * is2.grid.iu.edu will be removed from RR and diagnosis began this morning. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/05/scheduled-maintenance-is2gridiuedu-goc.html][Maintenance Notification]].
   * GOC Services Production Release on May 11th
      * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/05/goc-service-update-tuesday-may-11th-at.html][Change Log]]
      * Mostly minor bug fixes
   * CERN Closed for Holiday Thursday and Friday


---++ Engage (Mats, John, Chris)

12 users utilized 33 sites;

34354 jobs total (32432 / 1922 = 94.4% success);

113542.8 wall clock hours total (48413.6 / 65129.3 = 42.6% success);

The low success rate is due to a failed SE at Duke, which a lot of long running jobs tried to write to at the end of the jobs. When the writes failed, so the the jobs. Duke is working on repairing the SE, and the jobs have been stopped until the repairs are completed.

I will not be able to make the call today due to a conflict.


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Continuing work on ITB Robot enhancements
   * Also working on closing existing ITB trouble tickets (went from 33 to 22 over the last week) and feature requests
   * Waiting the VDT changes for xrootd and bestman before VTB testing will start
