   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 250~300TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues
      * MWT2 pilot submission problem: upgraded condor on the submit host to 7.7.6, which has a lot of improvements on how Condor-G handles GRAM5 CE more gracefully. Also increased time interval of probing job status against remote CE. Situation is much stable now. 
      * GlideInWMS and PanDA: under discussion; ATLAS will test it out.
