---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Alain, Mats, Xin, Armen, Brian, Suchandra, Tony, Marco, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Tony)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * After LHC came back from the technical stop last Tuesday, stable data taking. Still some beam quality issues to be fixed. Current collected luminosity for ATLAS ~1.15 fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of about 18-20K running jobs, mostly simulation type.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.4M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 250~300TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues
      * MWT2 pilot submission problem: upgraded condor on the submit host to 7.7.6, which has a lot of improvements on how Condor-G handles GRAM5 CE more gracefully. Also increased time interval of probing job status against remote CE. Situation is much stable now. 
      * GlideInWMS and PanDA: under discussion; ATLAS will test it out.  


---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations last week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/7wx9jel][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Kyle and Elizabeth were at Condor Week for training
   * ITB release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/05/goc-service-update-tuesday-may-8th-at.html][Release note]]
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Bluearc NAS appliance outage at FermiGrid will not affect OSG-facing services (Gratia, RESS, VOMS) but will 
      affect all job submission to FNAL_FERMIGRID gatekeepers.  Job submissions will be blocked from 8AM CST 5/1/2012 
      to approximately 9AM CST 5/2/2012.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Nothing for this week because of Condor week
      * Allison will be joining the factory

---+++ Operations this week
   * Rob Q. on vacation this week, Scott next week.
   * /usr/local on repo.grid.iu.edu to grown to 128 GB from 16 GB
   * www.grid.iu.edu retired
   * Physical move of an unused VM host from IUPUI to IUB
      * Will host GOC internal services, (monitor, jump, etc)
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * No changes planned.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Plan to test condor 7.6.7 on ITB Factory but won't likely upgrade GOC Factory this week but on next production window.
