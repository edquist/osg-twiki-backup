---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin) 

   * General production status. 
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was quite stable, at the average level of 60-65K running job slots. The production over the break generally was quite stable except a short hiccup close to the end of the year due to bug in the new DB release, which was quickly fixed.      
   * Job statistics for last week.     
      * Gratia report: 1.8M pilots, 5.3M walltime hours, and CPU/walltime ratio of 86% (for single core jobs)
      * 2.3M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard (~54K from OSG opportunistic resources).    
   * Talked with Brian about CMS's solution on BDII publishing subcluster information to REBUS. Will discuss with ATLAS at this week's Jamboree.
