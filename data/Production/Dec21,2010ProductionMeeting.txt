---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Marcia, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * LHC: CERN power cut over the weekend
   * 200 khour/day, 92% success
   * BlueArc latency issues at the Tier 1; working with vendor to resolve

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * US ATLAS production over the week was relatively stable at the level of ~10k running jobs. Majority of running jobs are Geant4 simulation tasks. Reconstruction step of some of that data, which is higher in priority for physics analysis, is also going on. Also some preparation for possible simulation at 8TeV energy if the decision is taken to increase the LHC energy. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 84%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 646K managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 92K jobs per day
         * failed 76K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  90%,  walltime - 95%
      * Failure rate is back to normal level. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 400~600TB/day, drop on Wednesday was due to the scheduled SE downtime. 
   * Issues

---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Marcia)

---+++ CDF

   * KISTI pbs issue solved.
 
---+++ GEANT-4

   * Finished the bulk of their validation and were happy with their use of the OSG.

---+++ GLUE-X

   * Glideins running at ~8 different sites.
   * Richard is working on a backlog now and is hoping to run a few hundred jobs per day in near future.
   * Opportunistic storage is confirmed to be working for D0.

---+++ DOSAR

   * Grid school went very well.

---+++ Fermi-VO

   * Ticket #9635 was opened three weeks ago; no response. GPN's VOMS server has been down.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * No security incidents/vulnerabilities. 
   * received service tickets from FNAL. user certificate issues with upgrading to Windows 7 and IE 8. Fnal service desk and windows support team is collaborating with OSG to help the users.
