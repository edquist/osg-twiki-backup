---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * LHC set new energy record, accelerate proton beam to 1.18Tev. 
   * General production status : During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 6-7K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. 
   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 955K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 945K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 144K jobs per day
         * failed 112K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 89%,  walltime - 96%
   * Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites, under investigation by GIP and CERN experts.

---++ Engage (John, Chris)
   * two users active with large runs: one we had known about (Rosetta), and the re-emergence of Jinbo Xu with Raptor (http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1001497). 
   * We are scheduling a call with Dr. Xu for later this week for two purposes: 1) gauge the anticipated upcoming capacity requirements; 2) his recent request to create his own science gateway backed up by OSG.
   * The Engage Submit host has been having some high load issues which Chris Bizon is investigating. Engage was getting very good throughput (order of 4k jobs sustained), but this has recently dropped down to 1k jobs, not sure yet if this is due to submit host issues or simply the state of cycle availability
