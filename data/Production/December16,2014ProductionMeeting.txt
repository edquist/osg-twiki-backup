---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not stable, at the average level of 15-30K running job slots. Still issues from the transition to the new production system and new dataset catalog system. Also problems with BNL FTS3 over weekend. Also BNL datadisk was almost full (due to pause in deletion system and almost 100% primary data content), which was limiting production.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.8M pilots, 2.3M walltime hours, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 65%.
      * 1.8 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.

---++ Release (Tim T.)

---+++ Release Schedule

---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)

We are working to enable GLOW to run on Fermigrid (no user cert attached).

Syracuse Univerity CE appears to be running well; http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/site?facility=SU-OG-CE

In the last week, the OSG VO has averaged ~500K hours per day; filling in the gaps around temporary drop in usage by other VOs.  We could probably access more but are demand limited (our users don't have more work to submit at this point).  

On Thursday, we have a phone call with FIU who is interested in joining OSG to share a 2000 core cluster.
