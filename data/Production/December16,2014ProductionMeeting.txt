   * Job statistics for last week

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the past week was not stable, at the average level of 15-30K running job slots. Still issues from the transition to the new production system and new dataset catalog system. Also problems with BNL FTS3 over weekend. Also BNL datadisk was almost full (due to pause in deletion system and almost 100% primary data content), which was limiting production.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.8M pilots, 2.3M walltime hours, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 65%.
      * 1.8 M real Jobs reported from the Atlas dashboard.
