      * Last week on Monday glideins from all gt5 sites went held again for CERN CMS Frontend glideins only between 8 and 9 am (PT) on all 3 factories:
         * Globus error 79: connecting to the job manager failed.  Possible reasons: job terminated, invalid job contact, network problems, ...
         * Before we assumed this happened when pilots used maximum number of open TCP connections however we are seeing the behavior on all gt5 sites regardless of how many pilots are in the queue
         * This morning it happened again but this time I had full debug on for our gridmanager logs and will send them to Jaime Frey of Condor Team.
