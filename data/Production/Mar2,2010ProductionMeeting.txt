---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:

---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 123 khour/day, 88% success.
   * LHC: In commissioning phase.  Beam splash seen; ramp up to collisions at 900 GeV, then up to 7 TeV in a few weeks.
   * Large global workflows beginning -- start at 50% of T1 and ramp up.

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Production level was low during the week, up and down, overall at the level of 1-3k running jobs, mainly simulation. The reprocessing has been all done without any major problem. Post mortem in two weeks.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.8M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 68%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 408K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 58K jobs per day
         * failed 44K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 90%,  walltime - 93%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer is 100~150 TB/day. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage: (from Mark) waiting on a reply from Robert Illingworth to let us know what we need to do to test D0 jobs on our system.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.6
      *       66 OSG 1.2.X resources (      18 are 1.2.6)
      *       10 OSG 1.0.X resources (       2 are 1.0.5)

---++ Metrics (Brian)

   * Busy week!  Last week, we had:
      * OSG Display presented to the DOE.
      * Operations switched over Gratia.
      * Just today, we've detected some issues on the OSG Display due to the new hardware ... we've asked FermiGrid admins to watch things in order to determine if this is a one time event or will reoccur (and hence require some code changes).
   * Continuing consistency work:
      * Info service RSV probe delivered to VDT
      * Been bothering operations weekly to watch the Gratia reports.

---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Abhishek)

   * D0 
      * MC Production has fully recovered after power outages.
      * Average 9.3 M Events/week; 84,000 wall-hours/day at 84% efficiency. 
      * Discussion moving forward with ATLAS/Mark@UTA on opportunistic SE access.
      
   * DOSAR
      * Workshop coming up in South Africa; April 6-8.
      * URL -- http://physics.uj.ac.za/conferences/2010/DOSAR/
      
   * Fermi-VO
      * Scheduled transition of Gratia services late last week. No known critical issues.
      * Discussion on !SubVO entries in OSG's VO-Package. More details with Rob Q.
   
   * !GridUNESP
      * Problem with local switch had caused site failures for LIGO jobs. Now resolved.

   * ALICE
      * Phone discussion with Jeff later today to discuss near-term US-ALICE plans.
