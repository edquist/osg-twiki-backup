---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Until last Thursday integrated luminosity of 26pb-1 at 7TeV. Fri-Mon test runs at the energy 2.76TeV. Now at technical stop until Thu. 
      * ATLAS production level start to decrease last week. Heavy Ion data reprocessing practically is done, except some tails. Waiting for new MC tasks to be defined, as well as reprocessing of cosmic ray data. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 80%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.3M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 180K jobs per day
         * failed 64K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 95%, walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * Recalculation of BNL site availability and reliability, with GOC and WLCG  -- GGUS ticket opened to trace its progress :

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)
---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus?count_sg_1&count_active=on&count_enabled=on&datasource=status][Current Status]]
   * Production release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-march-22-at.html][Release notes]]
      * is4 was put into DNS RR, but removed after a few hours because of seg faults appearing in the logs. 
      * Research after the removal shows these seg faults have no affect on the data, and can be safely ignored. 
         * Burt doesn't like the idea of this going to production until this issue is fully solved. 
   * Ticket Exchange Call with BNL
      * Should TX support attachments?
      * Extra alerting on failure cases.
   * New VO Package to ITB
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * New Frontend Status:
         * NWICG (Stephen Harrel - Purdue) - Frontend is set up, test jobs went through at UCSD, will enable them to submit to more sites this week
         * Engage (Steven Cox - RENCI) - Still working out Frontend installation details
         * OSG (Marco Mambelli) - Frontend is set up, test jobs went through
         * nanoHUB (Steven Clark - Purdue) - Frontend is set up, test jobs went through, working on job match expressions to correctly select desired sites

---++ Operations This Week
   * Fifth Tuesday, no release.
   * New VO Package to production (Approved by ITB on Monday)
      * CSIU Addition, CMS Requested Change, and Engage Group Add
      * Release targeted Tuesday
