---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC commissioning to train the beams for new settings is continuing. At the moment collisions for physics are promised for tomorrow. ATLAS production was generally stable during the last week at the level of 8-9k running jobs most of the time, mainly simulation jobs. There are enough defined jobs to keep queues busy for several weeks.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 86%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 853K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 122K jobs per day
         * failed 236K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 78%, walltime - 95%. 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was ~200TB/day.
   * Issues 
      * SLC5 - x86_64 kernel vulnerability announced Sep.16;patch prepared; many sites rebooted
      * Open more job slots to OSG users

---+++ Network outage
   * On 16/Sep between 9:10 and 9:45 EDT network traffic between the machine room in Indianapolis and Bloomington was blocked due to a mis-configured firewall. GOC services were apparently uneffected for outside users.

---+++ BDII stress test
   * At the suggestion of Burt H., Brian B., Igor S. in coordination with the GOC are proposing to stress test the BDII-itb. A script has been written that approximates a real use case request. It is proposed that this script will be run against the BDII-itb from many geographically distributed sites.
      * BDII-itb currently running a recent version (5.7.1)
      * BDII-itb was restarted with flags that allow detailed logging
      * munin tests installed to monitor/plot machine status
      * Small scale test is next (1 iteration, ~5 sites)
      * Then scale up until capacity to test is reached or machine cannot keep up. (Current rate is 1800 requests per minute, unfortunately, not evenly distributed between the two production instances)

---+++ Security exploit
   * A [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3081][security patch ]] is available. It will be installed on all itb machines today, all production machines next week.

---+++ Operations this week (ITB release)
   * BDII-itb restart, to enable detailed logging
   * ITB VM rebuild
   * RedHat updates to ITB machines (3rd Tuesday)
   * OIM DB table modified to allow "Tape Capacity" field 
   * OIM 2.25 (https://oim.grid.iu.edu)
   * MyOSG 1.27 (https://myosg.grid.iu.edu)
   * GOC Ticket 1.27 (https://ticket.grid.iu.edu)
   * Ticket Synchronizer 1.13
