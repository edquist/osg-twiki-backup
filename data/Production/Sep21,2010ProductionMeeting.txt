---+++ Network outage
   * On 16/Sep between 9:10 and 9:45 EDT network traffic between the machine room in Indianapolis and Bloomington was blocked due to a mis-configured firewall. GOC services were apparently uneffected for outside users.

---+++ BDII stress test
   * At the suggestion of Burt H., Brian B., Igor S. in coordination with the GOC are proposing to stress test the BDII-itb. A script has been written that approximates a real use case request. It is proposed that this script will be run against the BDII-itb from many geographically distributed sites.
      * BDII-itb currently running a recent version
      * BDII-itb was restarted with flags that allow detailed logging
      * munin tests installed to monitor/plot machine status
      * Small scale test is next (1 iteration, ~5 sites)
      * Then scale up until capacity to test is reached or machine cannot keep up. (Current rate is 1800 requests per minute, unfortunately, not evenly distributed between the two production instances)

---+++ Security exploit
   * A [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3081][security patch ]] is available. It will be installed on all itb machines today, all production machines next week.

---+++ Operations this week
   * BDII-itb restart, to enable detailed logging
   * ITB VM rebuild
   * RedHat updates to ITB machines (3rd Tuesday)
   * OIM DB table modified to allow "Tape Capacity" field
