---+!! OSG Production
Production is the culmination of all the OSG efforts (e.g. testing, integration, services, storage, support, operations, software, security, ...) when users get their jobs run, the results of their science. 
   * As the [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/][Production Database]] shows, OSG is directly responsible for delivering as many as 6 Million cpu-hours with nearly 200K job submissions daily.
