---+!! OSG Production
Production is the culmination of all the OSG efforts (e.g. testing, integration, services, storage, support, operations, software, security, ...) when users get their jobs run, their science complete. 
   * As the [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/][Production Database]] shows, OSG is directly responsible for delivering as many as 6 Million cpu-hours with nearly 200K job submissions daily.
