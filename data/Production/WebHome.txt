---+!! OSG Production
---+++ _"Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration."_
     --Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931)

Production is the culmination of all the OSG efforts (e.g. testing, integration, services, storage, support, operations, software, security, ...) when users get their jobs run, and generate the results of their science. As the [[http://display.grid.iu.edu][DOE Display]] shows: 
   * OSG routinely delivers between 5 and 6 Million cpu-hours per week with ~300K job submissions every day.
   * A petabyte of data is transferred approximately every 3 days.
