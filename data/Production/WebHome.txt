---+!! OSG Production
---+++ _"Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration."_
     --Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931)

Production is the culmination of all the OSG efforts (e.g. testing, integration, services, storage, support, operations, software, security, ...) when users get their jobs run, and generate the results of their science. 
   * As the [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/][Production Database]] shows, OSG is directly responsible for routinely delivering between 5 and 6 Million cpu-hours with ~200K job submissions every day.
   * As the [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/facility_transfer_volume/][Data Transfer Report]] shows, ~1 Million Gigabytes of data are transferred  every day.
