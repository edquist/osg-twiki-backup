---+!! OSG Production
__"Being busy does not always mean real work. The object of all work is production or accomplishment and to either of these ends there must be forethought, system, planning, intelligence, and honest purpose, as well as perspiration"__
--Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931)

Production is the culmination of all the OSG efforts (e.g. testing, integration, services, storage, support, operations, software, security, ...) when users get their jobs run, the results of their science. 
   * As the [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/][Production Database]] shows, OSG is directly responsible for delivering as many as 6 Million cpu-hours with nearly 200K job submissions every day.
   * As the [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/facility_transfer_volume/][Volume Transfer Rrecord]] shows, ~1 Million Gigabytes of data are transferred  every day.
