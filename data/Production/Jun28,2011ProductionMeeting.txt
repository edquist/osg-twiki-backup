---++ CMS (Burt)
   * LHC continues to perform well
   * Last week: 491 khour/day, 89% success
   * Opportunistic access still disabled at FNAL Tier 1 (will remain so until we understand our power/cooling issues)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC continued overall good operation, with a couple of hiccups, during the past week. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS is now about 1240pb-1. Tomorrow will start a technical stop. Operations to be resumed end of next week, Saturday.
      * US ATLAS production was quite stable at the average level of about 12k running jobs. Big majority of the jobs are from Geant4 re-simulation
campaign of all the existing MC samples.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.7M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 90%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.6M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 225K jobs per day
         * failed 97K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 94%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.1M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 300~400TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC has been running fine, still SLAC and NET T2s to add to support list
         * Engage: no update last week
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : preliminary version under testing
