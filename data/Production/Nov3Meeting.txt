   * Rob S. 
      * CMS has been offered a deal comparable to Atlas for purchasing hardware
      * Marie Christine is putting together a T3 document with a higher level executive outlook designed for the funding agencies.
This document could also help T3's understand better how to pitch their proposals and get help with funding.
      * There are 5-6 sites in start-up mode with another five coming in the next few months.
      * Startup sites are having the usual issues: networking; how to change/modify their CE's and SEs, ...
      * Of course not all of the sites are starting from scratch, some of these already had mini T3's operating and are adding hardware.
      * Terrence Martin gave a talk at the CMS T3 meeting that discussed security and best practice details for setting up Hadoop file systems. Maryland is planning to give Hadoop a try.
      * CMS is involved in the Xrootd demonstrator project with T2s for data distribution. They are also soliciting interested T3s to participate.
