---+++ CHARMM (Tim Miller)

   * Currently about half of mutant proteins for the current project are running. Tim expects completion of all 17 mutants by the end of November.
   * Help from Jose and Maxim on finding sites has been helpful. (See list of current sites being used at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20101021][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20101021]]

---+++ SBGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

   * A large number of pilot jobs are sitting at sites doing nothing. Ian will send out data.
   * Also seeing job failures at sites.

---+++ !GridUNESP 

   * Changing from Condor to pbs improved average success rates of jobs from 60 to 95%.

---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

   * Problem at KISTI: 40Hz of queries to pbs from !glideinWMS.  Pbs crashes every few hours. They have a cron checking every 5 min and doing a restart. Want to know what to tune where and whether there is a deeper architectural issue.
   * KISTI is a priority for CDF, as they run their production services off site. Gabriele is in Korea this week.
   * CDF also sees the pilot job sitting error that !SBGrid mentioned. 


---++ Security (Mine)
