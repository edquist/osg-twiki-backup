   * GLIDEINS
      * Submitted ten Glidein work-flows at FF to test scaling
         * Troubleshooting segfaults and exec call fails 
            * possibly due to wrong pegasus configuration 
            * testing fix
      * two glidein test work-flow at LIGO_CIT succeed
      * glidein test work-flow a UMissHEP: testing with adjusted pegasus configuration 
         
   * FILE TRANSFERS
      * tested code changes to enable srm-mkdir call
      * Further code enhancements in progress
      * TTU: site down, certs expired
      * UCSDT2: execute permission of pegasus executable lost in translation, contacted Terrence
      * UMissHEP: fork jobs run, md5sum check jobs in queue for days

   * TESTS WITH SRM SETUP
      * work-flows at CIT_CMS_T2, Firefly are running
      * Nebraska: symlinking of data fails-> tmpltbank jobs cannot find the data and fail
          * Missing data on Nebraska - fixed, resubmitted work-flow

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/368urd2][Reliability/Availability of GOC Services]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/34m9qvq][Reliability/Availability of Security Services]]
      * looking into results from SECMON_CRL, may be related to Brazil CA outages.
   * ITB release - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/10/goc-service-upgrade-tuesday-october_19.html][Release Notes]]
      * Including a TWiki version with X509 authentication. We hope this will speed up the registration process, as we will automate it from OIM. This will require an extensive bit of work in ensuring that user OIM information is correct and complete before we can release it into production.
   *  Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by Fermigrid Ops)
      * No issues this week. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/10/goc-service-upgrade-tuesday-october_19.html][Service Upgrade]] release notes
   * RHEL5 updates
   * WLCG Top Level BDII Project Team
      * We are hoping to host a top level BDII, there will be a meeting to discuss
      * The GOC has had a great deal of success in tests with a patch to fix some of the reliability problems of the most recent BDII release.
      * First Meeting was this morning (October 26th, 10:00 Eastern Time)
         * 866.740.1260  U.S. & Canada Toll-Free
         * 303.248.0285  International

   *  Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by Fermigrid Ops)
      * No issues this week. 


   * None attending. Keith reports no issues. 
---++ Engage (Mats, John)

No production issues. I will not be able to attend the call today.

16 users utilized 43 sites;

26602 jobs total (118953 / 7649 = 94.0% success);

254174.9 wall clock hours total (231425.8 / 22749.1 = 91.0% success);

---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * Released OSG 1.2.15 last week
      * Done by Scot following release steps
      * Confirmation of backup for releases
   * Next test cycle possibly starting next week

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Metrics (Brian)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Marcia)

---+++ CHARMM (Tim Miller)

   * Currently about half of mutant proteins for the current project are running. Tim expects completion of all 17 mutants by the end of November.
   * Help from Jose and Maxim on finding sites has been helpful. (See list of current sites being used at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20101021][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20101021]]

---+++ SBGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

   * A large number of pilot jobs are sitting at sites doing nothing. Ian will send out data.
   * Also seeing job failures at sites.

---+++ !GridUNESP 

   * Changing from Condor to pbs improved average success rates of jobs from 60 to 95%.

---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

   * Problem at KISTI: 40Hz of queries to pbs from !glideinWMS.  Pbs crashes every few hours. They have a cron checking every 5 min and doing a restart. Want to know what to tune where and whether there is a deeper architectural issue.
   * KISTI is a priority for CDF, as they run their production services off site. Gabriele is in Korea this week.
   * CDF also sees the pilot job sitting error that !SBGrid mentioned.
