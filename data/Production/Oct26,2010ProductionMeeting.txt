---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * GLIDEINS
      * Submitted ten Glidein work-flows at FF to test scaling
         * Troubleshooting segfaults and exec call fails 
            * possibly due to wrong pegasus configuration 
            * testing fix
      * two glidein test work-flow at LIGO_CIT succeed
      * glidein test work-flow a UMissHEP: troubleshooting fails 
         
   * FILE TRANSFERS
      * tested code changes to enable srm-mkdir
      * Further code enhancements in progress



   * TESTS WITH SRM SETUP
      * troubleshooting 3 day data set work-flows at CIT_CMS_T2, Nebraska

---+++ CHARMM (Tim Miller)

   * Currently about half of mutant proteins for the current project are running. Tim expects completion of all 17 mutants by the end of November.
   * Help from Jose and Maxim on finding sites has been helpful. (See list of current sites being used at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20101021][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOGroupMeeting20101021]]

---+++ SBGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

   * A large number of pilot jobs are sitting at sites doing nothing. Ian will send out data.
   * Also seeing job failures at sites.

---+++ !GridUNESP 

   * Changing from Condor to pbs improved average success rates of jobs from 60 to 95%.

---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

   * Problem at KISTI: 40Hz of queries to pbs from !glideinWMS.  Pbs crashes every few hours. They have a cron checking every 5 min and doing a restart. Want to know what to tune where and whether there is a deeper architectural issue.
   * KISTI is a priority for CDF, as they run their production services off site. Gabriele is in Korea this week.
   * CDF also sees the pilot job sitting error that !SBGrid mentioned.
