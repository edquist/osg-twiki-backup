   * General production status
      * 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 85%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1M managed/group MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs.
         * average 142K jobs per day
         * failed 95K jobs
         * average efficiency: 
            * jobs     - 91%
            * walltime - 95%
      * Failure rate was high on Monday and Tuesday, probably from the power outage at BNL.  
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 400~500TB/day.
   * Issues

---+++ ALICE 

   * There had been some GIP issues (accounting info may be understated) that needed to get resolved. A solution was put forth by NERSC, but Jeff Porter will find out whether this has been implemented.

---+++ CDF

   * CDF has been running production jobs at KISTI, making good progress; KISTI is going to add another hundred nodes dedicated to CDF.
   * However, the Running Experiments group at Fermilab reported glidein problems at the site. Stephan Lammel has asked Rick to run stress tests before KISTI can be reinstated. [General question: Are stress tests for !FermiGrid only or for OSG in general?]
   * Chander will facilitate a meeting including Gabriele, Steve Timm, Igor, and both CDF teams to help solve various issues.
 
---+++ General

   * Security team is seeking input from !VOs for Galois on needs and problems document (See http://grid2.galois.com/needs-and-problems.html
