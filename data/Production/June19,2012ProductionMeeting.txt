   * [[http://tinyurl.com/6nh3glo][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * New CA distribution released [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/06/osg-ca-distribution-129-release.html][Notice]]
      * Problem with synchronization of repo.grid and software.grid versions
   * New OSG stack, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/06/correction-osg-314-has-been-released.html][version 3.1.4]] released.
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/06/goc-service-update-tuesday-june-12th.html][release note]]
   * remove obsolete xml from !MyOSG deferred until July, earliest
   * repo.grid LVS enabled
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgrade GOC Factory to use Condor 7.6.7.
      * Discovered strange behavior for gt5 sites where all running jobs from a single DN go held with Globus error 79.
         * It may be due to limits of allowed open TCP connections at the CE
         * We are working with Brian Bockelman (UNL) and Bockjoo Kim (UFlorida) to try and reproduce the problem and better understand it.
         * For reference:

      * GOC disk partition filled to ~90% this weekend.  We cleared out old logs to get below 90%
         * Setting up a backup scheme with our new disk to reduce this will be top priority this week.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, note in preparation.

      * !MyOSG and OIM: PKI changes continue
      * display: Minor bug fix, php version update

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)
   * Bosco v1 work is continuing per plan.
   * Partitionable slots (for htPc) are running in two clusters at UNL and generally working well. There have been two Condor support tickets entered (2993, 3013) for relatively minor issues. Should be able to start writing documentation next week for other campuses to deploy.

Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
