 The Report is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

Action/Significant Items:

Attendees:

   * Mine, Chander, Britta, Rob, Marco, Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Abhishek

---++CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 182 khour/day, 95% success. CPU/wallclock at 73%.
   * Storage: Tier 1 transferred 1.3 PB last week (peak of 400 TB/day). Tier 2s transferred 300 TB (peak: 94 TB/day). Probes still not functional yet at MIT, UERJ. Florida still missing.
   * OSG: No change again: we have 3 CEs at OSG 1.2 (both Nebraska and cit-gatekeeper2). Tier 3s at 1.2: UCDavis, FIT, UMD, Vanderbilt, UCR.
   * Gratia: Discovered this week that status from the batch system isn't represented in the summary tables; for instance, condor auto-removing jobs from violating a memory limit in a SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE expression probably looks like a successful job. Job efficiency numbers I have reported thus far do not account for this. *Production Coordinator should talk to Gratia project lead. Brian will get an update and report back.*
   * RSV
      * Followup: What's the plans for testing and deployment of the gratia RSV probe? *This is moving to the ITB as we speak for testing.*
      * Condor_cron starting up large number of local scheduler jobs (vdt support 5721): update?  (Last response from VDT was Aug 27). *Rob will ping VDT for update*

---++Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * Sorry we won't attend this meeting in person, as Xin is on vacation, and Armen is in an ATLAS meeting at cern. 

   * Reprocessing jobs are in final test stage on the production system, if no problems bulk reprocessing can start late this week.

   * job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 693K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 93%. 
      * PanDA world-wide production report (real jobs):
         * completed successfully 344K managed MC production, validation jobs
         * average  50K jobs per day
         * failed   49K  jobs
         * average efficiency: 90% for jobs and 97% for walltime

   * Site issue
      * BNL dCache accounting probe catches up in reporting to central collector. Gratia team (Philippe) has done a lot of work on improving the probe for BNL site. 

---++ LIGO (Britta)

      * This week's total usage: 4 users utilized 18 sites; 
      * 3677 jobs total (3167 / 510 = 86.1% success);
      * 16776.6 wall clock hours total (13184.3 / 3592.3 = 78.6% success);
