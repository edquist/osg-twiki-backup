   * No BDII Outages during week of August 31st to September 6th
   * No Ops meeting this week due to the holiday

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB-BDII Testing is scheduled for this week, this will allow us to determine the period of time it takes the CERN BDII to catch up to changes at the OSG BDII. This will give us a baseline as to how far ahead we need to anticipate DNS RR changes to be sure no outage is experienced. All testing will be on non-production systems.

---+++ Future Events
   * October 17th Machine Room Move in Bloomington - All GOC Services in Bloomington are expected to be down. IUPUI will still be handling BDII traffic. GOC will attempt to install as many other services on an Indianapolis based server/VM as possible, especially other critical ones like !MyOSG.
