---+++ This Week

   * Grid Operations Center
      * No release this cycle
      * Rob out this week and next
      * Soichi out Friday through next week
      * Coverage assured through the holidays 
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * We have a fairly extensive outage this week on Thursday for our users.  Central dcache and enstore will be down for a sotware and database upgrade for most of the day.  Doesn't really effect OSG users too much.  All Fermigrid machines (including gatekeepers, batch system heads, etc) will be rebooted to pick up a new kernel but no long outages for any particular server.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Plan to start migration to glideinWMS rpm installation on GOC-ITB factory
   * OSG-Connect
      * Planning on migrating user home directories to separate service, no time scheduled but should result in minimal downtime for users
