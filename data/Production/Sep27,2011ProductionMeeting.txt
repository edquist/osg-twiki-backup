---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Another productive week for LHC. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now at 3.6fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of 12-13K running jobs, both of simulation and reprocessing job types.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.6M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 86% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200T~400T/day last week, normal. 
   * Issues
      * Cancelled downtime still affects site availability calculation
         * GOC ticket https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/10984
         * results need to be corrected, so that the monthly report won't be affected. 
         * GOC is helping trace it with SAM folks now.
