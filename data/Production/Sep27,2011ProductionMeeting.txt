---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Another productive week for LHC. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now at 3.6fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of 12-13K running jobs, both of simulation and reprocessing job types.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.6M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 86% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200T~400T/day last week, normal. 
   * Issues
      * Cancelled downtime still affects site availability calculation
         * GOC ticket https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/10984
         * results need to be corrected, so that the monthly report won't be affected.

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
