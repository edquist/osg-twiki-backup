   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * No changes or incidents last week on OSG Services
      * WSDL of ServiceNow changed last week.

   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded UCSD factory to use condor 7.6.6 as well as updated condor sent with glideins to 7.6.6.
         * Factory condor upgrade created huge load issues so we had to revert back to 7.6.2.  We contacted the Condor Team to help us investigate what happened.
         * We will continue to ship Condor 7.6.6 with glideins as we saw no problems there.  Our load issue is Condor-G related only.
         * Last week we started trying to reproduce load problem with ITB Factory but haven't been able to yet.  We will continue trying this week.
      * Added T3 support to CERN Factory; it now submits to all T3 sites we currently support at UCSD and GOC.
      * Enabled auto detection of gt5 sites in UCSD factory since sites are beginning to upgrade with OSG Release 3 rpms (This is already set at GOC since it is default behavior).
