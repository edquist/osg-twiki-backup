   * No changes due to holiday (Would have been an ITB Tuesday)
---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Successfully installed glideinWMS 2.5.4 and condor 7.6.4 on new GOC ITB factory machine.
      * Enabled a subset of sites for submission to verify hardware works as expected; no problems encountered.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * No changes scheduled
   * Change schedule returns to normal next Tuesday (ITB, Production following week)
   * XSEDE front end server has arrived, storage has shipped. To be racked next available maint. window 
---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Plan to clone the entire configuration from the UCSD factory into GOC ITB factory and verify we no longer have scaling issues.
   * After testing glideinWMS 2.5.4 and condor 7.6.4 on ITB we may upgrade the UCSD factory as well.
   * Continue to train Tim Mortensen our new UCSD hire who will assist in factory ops duties.
