---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Bug in BDII RSV Probe caused RSV tests to fail from Midnight on 1/1 until ~22:00. This was noticed by the GOC but not considered critical since the BDII was working fine.

---++ Operations This Week

   * Nothing in the works, will do a RSV release next week to remove dependency on UNL.
   * Await results of BDII testing before adding is4 to DNS RR.
      * Some complications when logs were turned on today and BDII was restarted. 
      * We are trying to schedule a time tomorrow to talk to CERN BDII folk about how they addressed this issue. 
   * Current filter on is1 and is2 exclude SE Only resources, should this be fixed in the next maintenance window?
