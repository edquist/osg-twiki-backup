---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Past Sunday LHC finished the pp collision program for this year. So we finished with the total collected luminosity for ATLAS at 5.25fb-1. LHC preparation is underway for the Heavy Ion collisions. On the way they may try a 2 day run of proton to Heavy Ion collisions. The expected period for the Heavy Ion run is Nov.14 - Dec.8.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was mainly stable, at the average level of 12K running jobs, with the exception of a drop on Mon-Tue. The problem was caused by misconfiguration of Panda at one of the ATLAS T1 sites, which created a big number of holding jobs, and backlog to register big amount of files, and load on the database. All the clouds were set to brokeroff for half a day. Situation is back to normal now, but all this event is under investigation to understand the chain of events and prevent it from reoccurring.
      * _Armen will followup next week_
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.1M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 81% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 250T~550T/day at BNL T1 in last week.
   * BNL T1 downtime this week (Nov 7~Nov 9th)
      * T1: network maintenance on Nov 7th, followed by dcache upgrade and gatekeeper upgrade, through Nov 9th
      * T2s: little going on Nov 7th (FTS shutdown, and pilot submission stopped at T1), restarted from Nov 8th, using other T1s for data transfer
   * Issues

---+++ Gratia Reports

   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 13 sites
      * 65540 jobs total (46937 / 18603 = 71.6% success)
      * 109418.5 wall clock hours total (100357.0 / 9061.5 = 91.7% success)
   * Current week's total usage: 5 users utilized 14 sites
      * 58668 jobs total (42524 / 16144 = 72.5% success)
      * 77064.3 wall clock hours total (69265.7 / 7798.6 = 89.9% success)


---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * One 50,000 job dag submitted to local glidein factory, running over 18 OSG sites
      * Monitoring progress, no issues
   * Local OSG ITB testbed "LIGO_CIT" is decommisioned
      * LIGO would like to utilize OSG glidein factory
