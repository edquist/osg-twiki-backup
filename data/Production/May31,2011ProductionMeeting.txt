---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Stable operation from LHC at a good luminosity during the past week. Operating with 1092 bunches now. Total accumulated luminosity for ATLAS about 520pb-1.
      * US ATLAS production was mostly stable at the average level of about 10-12k running jobs, mostly simulation. The rate dropped at the middle of the week and then picked up again.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 90%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.4M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 194K jobs per day
         * failed 100K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 93%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 820K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC: working in progress on 4 T2 sites (BU, HU, WT2, SWT2_CPB).
         * Engage is the next VO that we will help run on USATLAS resources. 
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : preliminary version under testing

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Security Drill (aka SSC5) coordinated by the EGI, started the week of May 16th - 20th. 
      * The first incident notice went out on Wednesday May 18th. The only OSG site involved was IllinoisHEP (because of panda configuration issues at some of the other OSG sites).
      * IllinoisHEP responded to the incident on Wednesday afternoon and reported back to the SSC5 coordinators.
      * The drill was ended on Friday May 20th.  Drill coordinators are now working with sites to get their final reports. They will then start compiling their final report on all sites involved later this week. The grading of the sites will follow afterwards. 
   * No major incidents or vulnerabilities
   * Security controls are halfway done. Thank you for those who submitted their answers. If you have not, please take a moment to fill out the security questionnaire. Will be at GOC for the rest of the week to complete the controls. 
   * VOMS admin upgrade. Will discuss this more via email. 
   * Anand is coming back to the US this week June 2nd. Will resume the certificate migration work.
