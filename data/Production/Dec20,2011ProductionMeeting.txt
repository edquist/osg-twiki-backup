   * General production status
      * US ATLAS production during the week was at the average level of ~10K running jobs. Significant drop in production over the weekend due to panda configuration problem during the replacement of the faulty hardware at CERN, which itself created problem with new pilots. 
      * Ongoing reprocessing of the heavy ion data. Also computing resources will be heavily used over the holiday period for urgent simulations, so management asked sites for limited downtimes.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 2.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 82%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2M 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 300~500TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.
