---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status

      * Ongoing reprocessing of the heavy ion data. Also computing resources will be heavily used over the holiday period for urgent simulations, so management asked sites for limited downtimes.

      * Gratia report: 2.6M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 82%
