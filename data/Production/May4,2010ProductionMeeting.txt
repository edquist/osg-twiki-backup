         * Ticket 8517 - Problem with yum update process on CA Distribution probe, Anand is looking into it for the security group. Yum errrors may be related to a larger RH issue. 
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-27th.html][GOC Production Service update]] -- complete; one-two minute outages experienced due to VM reconfiguration.
      * No bugs reported, no outages detected by monitoring as they were very short. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *GOC ITB Service update*: On May 4th 2010 
      * WLCG BDII Monitoring will be included. This will just be a display of the results at this point, alarming will be handled at a later point, when we are more familiar with the monitoring results. 
   * *Ongoing - Top Level WLCG BDII Monitoring* 
      * MyOSG GIP-validation view modified to include these results; expect release on May 11th.
   * *Ongoing - Ticket Exchange (TX)*: 
      * *FNAL Remedy* 
         * No Change
         * Tony Tiradani (USCMS) reports problems closing Remedy tickets when GOCTicket is closed under current TX mechanism. Tony has requested priority bump at FNAL. 
         * Fermigrid and GOC will do some testing after this call to see if they can get to the bottom of this issue.
