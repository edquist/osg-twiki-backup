---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/35zl55c][Security Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-february-8th.html][Release notes]] available.
   * Work continues on Gratia Web at the GOC.
      * Ashu says he can look more on Wednesday of this week. 
   * Transient !MyOSG failure early Sunday morning, under investigation [[http://itnotices.iu.edu/list.aspx?day=3%2f13%2f2011][Prime suspect]]
      * 3:30AM Failed, 3:31AM OK 
   * Investigation of IU firewall issues [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/NDT_perf.jpg][results]]
   * Gratia
      * Await Gratia RSV probe for the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus?count_sg_1&count_active=on&count_enabled=on&datasource=status][ status page]]
   * Glide In Factory
      * The factory was down from Friday 3/4, 9 pm (PT) to Saturday 3/5, 5 pm due to a SSD failure
         * Upgraded os from RHEL4 to RHEL5 - the replacement SSD was not compatible with the RHEL4 kernel
         * Upgraded to glideinWMS 2.5.1 - we were planning to upgrade anyway, so we did this to minimize total downtime
      * 3/11 - Discovered a bug in the glideinWMS code that may have been causing inefficiencies for some of our VO Frontends
         * GLIDEIN_Max_Walltime was using our default value for 24h instead of what we specify per site entry.
         * Igor patched the code and submitted the patch to glideinWMS
   * Follow us on Twitter @OSGGOC. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Change in use of puppet on ITB machines to clear memory issues related to puppetd
   * ITB release, note in preparation
      * changes in !MyOSG and GOC ticket to allow ticket searches from !MyOSG
      * TWiki configuration change to allow large file upload, will only go to production if cleared by security team before Prod Release date
   * GOC TX to address "binary character issue"

---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * ITB testing ongoing

      * In ITB testing,   tentatively scheduling for next tuesday (March 22)
      * Troubleshooting RSV probe issues
    * HTPC
       * Picking up efforts and will be enabling it on at least 2 sites this week

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Note that this report lists the currently active resources in OSG.
If a site is down or not reporting it will not be counted.
Therefore there may be fluctuations.
Each line has the current number and variation from last week in parenthesis.
You can find a table with current OSG and VDT versions at http://www.mwt2.org/~marco/myosgldr.php
   * Site update status (from !MyOSG as of today):
      * Most recent production version is OSG 1.2.18
      *       91 (-4) OSG 1.2.X resources (       9 are 1.2.18)
      *        3 (0) OSG 1.0.X resources (       0 are 1.0.6)
      *        2 (0) OSG 1.0.0 resources
      *        1 (0) OSG 0.8.0 resources
Site coordination meeting this week, 3/17

---++ User Support (Chander)
No meeting last week due to OSG-AHM.  SURAGrid is joining as an OSG VO and we will organize needed effort to support this integration.

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Testing the new certificate layout in ITB. Anand explained the issue to Suchandra and Dan at AHM. We will test it against older osg versions and also osg packages other than the ce. Europeans made the switch to the new certificates and had a major problem with VOMS-Admin. they had to roll-back. Some of the osg versions we like to test are not in ITB. We wnt to discuss if we can work with a few production sites.
   * Connectivity problems with Japanese CA. Sent out the announcement to sites. RSV probes will fail for CRL updates. This is not a problem for any site. We asked us-atlas management if we should do any more work for affected us-atlas users. We also started a thread of discussion on what to do in cases of CA failures. 
   * Several bug reports and evaluation requests. More important ones: DOEGrids host cert formats. We discovered some host certificates are issued without ssl server capabilities. This is important and we are debugging the problem. The security team cannot re-generate the problem. But apparently it happens to some other gridadmins. 
   * Goc requested an evaluation of ssl renegotiation errors. 
   * Xrootd provider asked recommendation over authentication to be used with xrootd. 
   * glexec vulnerabilities have been reported. Not a major risk.
   * DZero reported an operational problem with GUMS and requested a feature. Relayed to Hover. He has it on its list. 
   * Security controls are going on. 
   * Site security training materials. We gave a security training at the AHM. We sent the materials to the broader community to sites email list.    
   * We heard one operational request during these: security announcements from GOC only reach primary security contacts. We will create a ticket with GOC and see why secondary contacts do not get the announcements. 
   * Important security controls will be resumed in future again. We will start another set of incident drills. We will inform you.
