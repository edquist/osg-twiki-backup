---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC restarts collisions at 7TeV with stable beams over the weekend. Small number of colliding bunches yet, to be increased in the coming weeks.
      * ATLAS production was quite stable during the week at the average level of 10-12k running jobs. It was mainly simulation jobs. Today start of the heavy ion data reprocessing. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 90%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.3M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 188K jobs per day
         * failed 73K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 95%, walltime - 96%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * Recalculation of BNL site availability and reliability, with GOC and WLCG  -- downtime and CE records are corrected, SE records to be done.

   * E@H rank based on RAC: 2 
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)

---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL

   * I (Britta) am attending the Joint LIGO-VIRGO meeting this week
   * I will be on vacation the following week

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/35zl55c][Security Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/03/goc-service-update-tuesday-february-8th.html][Release notes]] available.
   * Work continues on Gratia Web at the GOC.
      * Ashu says he can look more on Wednesday of this week. 
   * Transient !MyOSG failure early Sunday morning, under investigation [[http://itnotices.iu.edu/list.aspx?day=3%2f13%2f2011][Prime suspect]]
      * 3:30AM Failed, 3:31AM OK 
   * Investigation of IU firewall issues [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/NDT_perf.jpg][results]]
   * Gratia
      * Await Gratia RSV probe for the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus?count_sg_1&count_active=on&count_enabled=on&datasource=status][ status page]]
   * Glide In Factory
      * The factory was down from Friday 3/4, 9 pm (PT) to Saturday 3/5, 5 pm due to a SSD failure
         * Upgraded os from RHEL4 to RHEL5 - the replacement SSD was not compatible with the RHEL4 kernel
         * Upgraded to glideinWMS 2.5.1 - we were planning to upgrade anyway, so we did this to minimize total downtime
      * 3/11 - Discovered a bug in the glideinWMS code that may have been causing inefficiencies for some of our VO Frontends
         * GLIDEIN_Max_Walltime was using our default value for 24h instead of what we specify per site entry.
         * Igor patched the code and submitted the patch to glideinWMS
   * Follow us on Twitter @OSGGOC. 

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Change in use of puppet on ITB machines to clear memory issues related to puppetd
   * ITB release, note in preparation
      * changes in !MyOSG and GOC ticket to allow ticket searches from !MyOSG
      * TWiki configuration change to allow large file upload, will only go to production if cleared by security team before Prod Release date
   * GOC TX to address "binary character issue"
