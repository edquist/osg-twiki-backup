---++ Action/Significant Items:

---++ Attendees:
Apologies: Rob Quick, Scott Teige (EGI Technical Forum)
 
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Overall productive week for LHC, with some record performances, and data taking. Total collected luminosity for ATLAS now is 3.2fb-1.
      * US ATLAS production during the week was quite stable, at the average level of 12K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.8M pilot jobs, with cpu/walltime ratio of 85% 
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 940K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate wasn't reported last week due to timed out local probe on site, restarted probe, gratia data should be recovered shortly. 
   * Issues
      * Cancelled downtime still affects site availability calculation
         * GOC ticket https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/10984
         * results need to be corrected, so that the monthly report won't be affected. 
         * GOC is helping trace it with SAM folks now.

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/3k3lqjh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/09/goc-service-update-september-13th-at.html][release notes]] are available
   * OIM moved to Bloomington.
   * We expect a Middleware Release from VDT containing the Apache DoS patch. 
   * New VO Package Release with LBNE expected. 
      * This was not released due to some changes, as I'm traveling this may need to wait a bit longer. 
   * !GlideIn Factory
      * Last week on Tuesday we caught a major bug due to a mistake when patching glideinWMS code on the UCSD Factory on Friday (9/9).
         * A patch initially applied on Thursday 9/8 two hours before SD power outage had a bug that corrupted our glidein match expression
         * Friday when applying the fix we updated the source but forgot to reconfigure thus leaving the bad patch in place
         * On Tuesday (9/13) we discovered the match expression was corrupt because glideins were starting user jobs on sites where they shouldn't run
         * We were able to fix it immediately on discovery of the problem
         * Frank will send a formal summary / report to OSG this week and we are investigating ways to monitor this type of error to catch it sooner

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB Servers OS Updates
      * Will have the Apache DoS vulnerability patch
      * As well as other updates to kernel and packages
   * Continuing BDII v5 testing: 3rd week of continuous load testing. Starting to reveal an abnormal CPU usage increase on is-itb1.
   * Operations would like to Invite CMS and ATLAS to test is5.grid.iu.edu a V5 BDII for accuracy. This is not in the production RR until CMS and ATLAS can validate. 
   * GOC-TX interface for Fermilab's new ticketing system "ServiceNow" is taking shape. I am currently waiting for Fermilab to enable notification email so that I can start end-to-end testing.   
   * !GlideIn Factory
      * GOC Production factory is up - [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/09/goc-production-glidein-factory-service.html][Notification]]
         * VOs can contact us at osg-gfactory-support@physics.ucsd.edu to register their frontends
         * Uses glideinWMS 2.5.2 and condor 7.6.3
         * Configuration mirrors UCSD instance, any sites previously available to VOs have carried over into the GOC instance
         * Announced it is ready this morning on osg-gfactory-announce@physics.ucsd.edu
