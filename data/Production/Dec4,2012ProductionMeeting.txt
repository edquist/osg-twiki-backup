   * General production status
      * After the machine development period, which ended Thursday, LHC was back in operation. About 0.7fb-1 delivered luminosity. Current total collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~21.5 fb-1. Dec.6-17 will be machine development and run period with completely new beam structure, to understand possible beam setup for after long shutdown run. Pause for holidays after that.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 20-24K running jobs. Reprocessing of the main data (bulk reprocessing) is practically done. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2 M
