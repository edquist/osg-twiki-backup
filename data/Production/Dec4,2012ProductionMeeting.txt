---++ CMS (Tony)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * After the machine development period, which ended Thursday, LHC was back in operation. About 0.7fb-1 delivered luminosity. Current total collected luminosity for ATLAS is ~21.5 fb-1. Dec.6-17 will be machine development and run period with completely new beam structure, to understand possible beam setup for after long shutdown run. Pause for holidays after that.
      * US ATLAS production during the last week was quite stable, at the average level around 20-24K running jobs. Reprocessing of the main data (bulk reprocessing) is practically done. 
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.3M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 90%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1.2 M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was around 400TB/day at BNL T1. 
   * Issues

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/9oh5bzh][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * No release, Thanksgiving holiday.
   * Physical installation of OASIS vm host, storage array complete, OS install, vm builds in progress
      * On schedule
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * UCSD T2 network switch had failures on Friday (11-30), network went down twice, and was brought down a third time for maintenance to replace hardware.
         * Factory services brought back up at 18:00 PST
         * GOC and CERN Factories continued to serve frontends while UCSD was effectively offline
      * Over the weekend Condor gridmanagers began crashing on all factories and caused all CMS Analysis glideins to fail.
         * We had to completely restart condor on UCSD GOC and CERN factories, as well as clear out any left over CMS glideins on the queues
         * We seem to have recovered and this did not affect other frontends
         * Condor developers have been notified and we are still trying to understand exactly what the cause was

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, release note in preparation
      * OS updates, expect reboots
      * Installed capacity report updated
      * Internal changes to ticket
   * Wednesday target for OASIS Online
   * Wednesday Meeting with !NoVA as first Beta User
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * We will send out an announcement tomorrow to all our frontends that the SDSC Factory is ready and will officially be a production service on the next Production window, Dec 11
