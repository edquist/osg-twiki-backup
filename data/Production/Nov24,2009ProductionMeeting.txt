---+++ Binary Inspiral

      * Transferring data into Firefly via GUC: one month done
      * Cause of srm-copy issue: rfc compliant proxy and srm-copy  are not working in conjunction
      * Planning to submit work-flow on Wednesday before vacation (11/25 - 12/06)

---++ Integration (Suchandra)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Metrics (Brian)

   * Metrics is working full-steam on the new "OSG Display" for the DOE.
      * Hence, production related activities (such as the naming convention alignment) are taking a bit of a rest.  Will probably pick back up after the holidays.
   * Monthly eJOT reports are about to go out (tomorrow).  Everything looks good.
   * Have transferred the t2.unl.edu applications to a GOC dev webserver.  There are some tweaks needed, but hopefully this means we can roll this out soon (again, progress on this will depend on the OSG Display progress).

---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * Last week's status history 
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/yejwd2j][GOC Services: BDII, MyOSG, RSV Collector]]
      * [[http://tinyurl.com/ybo4sjd][GOC hosted Security services managed by OSG security team]]
   * !MyOSG paper ([[http://www.collab-ogce.org/gce09/images/5/5d/AGopuMyOSG.pdf][slides]]) was presented at [[http://www.collab-ogce.org/gce09/index.php/Program][GCE'09 workshop on Nov 20th]] (part of SC'09 conference) @ Portland, OR
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/11/osg-124-release-announcement.html][OSG 1.2.4 Released]] 
      * Gratia RSV Probe, updates to configure-osg, etc.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * *Carried over* - low priority item: GOC will be removing www.grid.iu.edu, and redirecting it to Operations blog instead. 
      * Stalled - need to find a spot for ticket reports before we can complete this move
         * GOCTicket would be an ideal location
   * *Production Release Tuesday Nov 24th*: [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2009/11/goc-itb-release-notes-10-17-2009.html][Scheduled Release]] of OIM 2.10, !MyOSG 1.11, Ticket 1.10.

---+++ WLCG Ops
   * CERN LHC VOMS Service was unavailable for 20 minutes. Monday 16:02 -> 16:21 UTC there was complete unavailability of the voms service. Cause was a misconfiguration of the gd lcg-fw service. Service restored after automatic notification to service manager. 


---++ Security (Mine)
   * LIGO's debian CA package request. Security team finished developing/implementing package creation. 
       * will be tested next week. Dec 1st is a new IGTF CA release. 
   * Anand has downloaded new VDT and could not find edg-mkgridmap file cron job. maybe it is our mistake... but we will try installing the new package again
   * CMS production sent a list of comments on ca management and RSV probes. We re-generated and debugged the problems with them
   * new vulnerabilities but not high level risk. We are testing pakiti (vulneraility monitoring tool developed by EGEE) to whether use in OSG
