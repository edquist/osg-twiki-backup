---++ Action/Significant Items:

---++ Attendees:
   * 
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * CRL bug affected UCSD and Florida
      - Somehow some CRLs became zero-length on two different CMS sites.  CRL update then does not update those CRLs anymore.
   * LIGO jobs filled $OSG_DATA at Florida; LIGO user was informed.
   * Computing: 84 khour/day, 95% success. CPU/wallclock at 68%.
   * Storage: 276 TB xfer (T1), 42 TB (others)
   * OSG: Nearly all at 1.2 (only Rutgers and OSU @ 1.0)
   * Non-CMS/CDF preemption issue @ MIT_CMS: second suggested fix not yet implemented at MIT.
   * D0 opportunistic storage -- no recruits yet (could only make the tail end of the T2 mtg today).

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * During the last two weeks USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 8K running jobs. Reprocessing was finished by the end of 2009, as planned. BNL T1 processed ~50% of all jobs.  The reprocessing jobs are short in CPU but long in stage-in and stage-out, making cpu/walltime ratio lower, reflected in the following job stats. 
   * Job statistics for last two weeks. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 31 for the last week of 2009, and 81% for the first week of 2010. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 2M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 291K jobs per day
         * failed 226K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 89%,  walltime - 90%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. Got the new ldap query from Burt, running it now on ganglia.
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  We will try to contact Joel from D0, figuring out details about configuration etc.

---++ LIGO (Britta)

   * Gratia reports:
   * Current week's total usage: 4 users utilized 30 sites;
      * 2424 jobs total (2372 / 52 = 97.9% success);
      * 30.4 wall clock hours total (25.7 / 4.7 = 84.5% success);
   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 33 sites;
      * 2641 jobs total (2571 / 70 = 97.3% success);
      * 87.8 wall clock hours total (64.7 / 23.1 = 73.7% success);
 
   * E@H reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 170,585.60004
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 10 (-7)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 11 (+0)
   
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace

 
---+++ Binary Inspiral
    * 3 day test work-flow on Firefly: Gap in data error

---++ Engage (John, Chris)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * OSG 1.2.5 release delayed due to last minute issues
   * Considering making an interim release of xrootd/bestman components for ATLAS
