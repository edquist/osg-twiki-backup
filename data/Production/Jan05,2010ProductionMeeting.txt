   * 
 
---++ CMS (Burt)

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * During the last two weeks USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 8K running jobs. Reprocessing was finished by the end of 2009, as planned. BNL T1 processed ~50% of all jobs.  The reprocessing jobs are short in CPU but long in stage-in and stage-out, making cpu/walltime ratio lower, reflected in the following job stats. 
   * Job statistics for last two weeks. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.9M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 31 for the last week of 2009, and 81% for the first week of 2010. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 2M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 291K jobs per day
         * failed 226K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 89%,  walltime - 90%       
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as previous weeks. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. Got the new ldap query from Burt, running it now on ganglia.
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  We will try to contact Joel from D0, figuring out details about configuration etc.

   * E@H reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 170,585.60004
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 10 (-7)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 11 (+0)
   
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace
