   * General production status
      * No collisions for physics and data taking during the last week. LHC is working to increase number of bunches and improve beam conditions.
      * US ATLAS production was running reprocessing of cosmic ray data last week, which was completed late Sunday. Now running fast reprocessing of 2011 data and new MC11 simulation jobs. Production is back to the normal level of 10-12k running jobs.

         * completed 776K managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 111K jobs per day
         * failed 57K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 93%, walltime - 95%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~300TB/day in last week.

   * E@H rank based on RAC: 4 (-1)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3 (+-0)


---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL
   * transferred 1 week of data (0.14) TB to FF, submitted work-flow
   * transferring 1 week of data (0.14) TB to CIT_CMS_T2
   * trouble shooting failed 1 week work-flow at Nebraska work-flow submitted

---+++ LIGO/PULSAR
   * running two large work-flows (>10000 jobs) via GlideinWMS on OSG (4 sites, pre staged data)

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)
---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * DOEGrids CA Services Down Friday, April 1st- [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/doegrids-services-outage-update-goc.html][Notification]]
      * Announced back up  ~noon Monday, April 4th. Services were actually restored late Friday evening (about 22:30 EST).
      * Please resubmit any cert requests made during this period.
   * DOEGrids Cert Requests with FF4 need configuration change before working. See [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=10203][ticket]] for solution. 
   * ITB Services [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-12th.html][release]]
      * State Optional in OIM
      * !MyOSG / Gip Validator Consolidator
      * Made changes to the top level wlcg bdii monitor script so that BDII entries are loaded one at a time instead of all at once in order to prevent timeout issue caused during low throughput events of IU network.
   * Gratia and !ReSS 
      * Running Site RSV Collector monitoring ReSS and other Fermigrid Services   
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * New Frontend Status
         * Engage (Steven Cox - RENCI) - Completed frontend installation and registered with factory to submit to 24 sites.  Test jobs have run successfully.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-12th.html][Release notes]]
   * All services to be moved outside IU institutional firewall.
      * Testing has proven that the institutional firewall substantially slows service. [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/NDT_perf.jpg][The results]]
      * Results to CERN today since 9AM EDT and 11AM EDT Respectively <br>

     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Picture_2.png" alt="Picture_2.png" width='508' height='295' />    
   * DOEGrid maintenance 13/Apr, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/04/doegrids-maintenance-notice-april-13.html][Maintenance notice]] and perhaps a subsequent regular scheduled maintenance window.
   * SAM data consumer was down over the weekend. RSV reports have "Unknown" status on Sunday. Data has been resent.
   * is4 is in DNS RR.
      * Seg faults are not appearing 
   * Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by !FermiGrid Ops)
      * Some network maintenance but no exact time/date available at this point.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Will be setting up entries for Engage to run large memory (4GB) jobs on sites that permit it.

---++ Engage (Mats, John)


---++ Integration (Suchandra)
   * ITB Testing
      * Waiting for VDT update
   * HTPC
      * Have test script, verifying resources with it

---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ Virtual Organizations Group (Chander)


---++ Security (Mine)
   * Announcements: Anand is traveling to a Data conference for NCSA on Th-Fr. Barlow is back from his trips. Mine is at globusworld M-Tu
   * Vulnerabilities/Bug/Incidents:
      * We did not have any important vulnerabilities or incidents. 
      * glexec vulnerability report is written. 
      * bug reported in ca-cert-expiry probe. Evaluating the vulnerability/bug. 
   * Production test of new cert layout is going on. We continue to hold separate meetings. 
   * Started making a plan on security test and controls. The controls and tests are meant to measure and evaluate the security of the osg run services and assets. These are done yearly and they are described in the OSG Security Plan. They cover all services run by OSG. The plan is the highest priority work item. The plan summarizes which security controls will be executed, which area leads (other than security) will contribute, how much work is estimated from all parties. I will work on this with Chander to coordinate and plan across different areas. 
   * Working on the big-picture security plan that shows the security processes lifecycle. The document meant to map our activities against the security lifecycle.
