---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/74grr6b][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/04/update-doegrids-certificate-service_04.html][DoEGrids outage]]
      * Affected end user cert renewal, grid admin, and service certs. Some interfaces still worked (cert-request). We are not clear on the root cause of this outage, we are waiting for an explanation from DOEGrids. A configuration change at DOEGrids fixed the issue. 
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/04/goc-service-update-tuesday-april-10th.html][ITB release]]
      * Services moving to new IP range
         * Will work closely with all service providers to be sure this is transparent. We should let Glidein Ops know when the change is made and when the old IPs go away. 
   * !FermiGrid
      * Should the display-itb be querying the production Gratia collector? Some queries are causing issues at the collector. 
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Continued addressing load issues at UCSD Factory:
         * Reduced number of condor schedds from 20 to 9
         * Saw gridmanagers getting stuck in weird loops.  Jaime discovered a bug and supplied us a patch.  Our load improved greatly since applying the patch.
      * Added OSG XSEDE to ~12 new sites for glidein submission
      * Discovered glideinWMS bug where if we put one VO in temporary downtime from submitting to sites, others get put down as well.
         * SBGrid submission is under extended maintenance... Engage to Tusker were affected. 
         * We put in a temporary workaround.
      * Upgraded UCSD factory to glideinWMS 2.5.7 on Fri Apr 6
         * This fixes the auto held job removal issues we were hitting

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release
      * Physical move of two servers out of the production rack
      * Relocation of some VMs to new hosts
      * Services moving to new IP range
      * Version upgrade for Google maps, partial rollback on repo
   * !FermiGrid
      * April, 10 VOMRS will be be going away for all voms.opensciencegrid.org hosted VOs. 
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * We will upgrade GOC Production to use glideinWMS 2.5.7 on tomorrow's production window.
         * GOC will be in contact with glidein ops to be sure there is no physical maintenance going on during this upgrade. 
   * New VO Package with LSST send to ITB for testing

---++ Campus Infrastructures / HTPC (Dan, Brooklin)

   * Started tracking metrics for Campus Infrastructures: email list members; number of deployed infrastructures profiled; number of best practices shared
   * Bosco v0 is complete and released. We have finalized the Bosco v1 feature list and have almost completed the work plan. Target is a release by June 30.
   * Condor 7.7.6 is in the final release stage. This version contains the elements required for dynamic provisioning to better support whole machine jobs.

---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)
   * OSG release today
      * Primarily update of ca certs
   * Working on major release:
      * SL6 CE support
      * Fixes for several other components
      * ETA ~2 weeks
 
---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
   * Started planning transition of jobs/users from RENCI engage submit host; first will be Baker Lab flocking to move to UCSD
   * Need to plan the re-homing of the Virginia Tech Campus Grid flocking; who in OSG staff supports that team?
   * Recent contact with U-Maryland about connecting a 1500 core cluster to OSG.  They are part of the Bioinformatics community and are part of a gene sequencing center at http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/ . They had originally started this dialog with John !McGee (Engage) but it now makes sense to transition this work to User Support.  The idea is to connect their site in VO=osg; and they hope to get that accomplished in 1-2 months.
