---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
   * Started planning transition of jobs/users from RENCI engage submit host; first will be Baker Lab flocking to move to UCSD
   * Need to plan the re-homing of the Virginia Tech Campus Grid flocking; who in OSG staff supports that team?
   * Recent contact with U-Maryland about connecting a 1500 core cluster to OSG.  They are part of the Bioinformatics community and are part of a gene sequencing center at http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/ . They had originally started this dialog with John !McGee (Engage) but it now makes sense to transition this work to User Support.  The idea is to connect their site in VO=osg; and they hope to get that accomplished in 1-2 months.
