   * Started tracking metrics for Campus Infrastructures: email list members; number of deployed infrastructures profiled; number of best practices shared
   * Bosco v0 is complete and released. We have finalized the Bosco v1 feature list and have almost completed the work plan. Target is a release by June 30.
   * Condor 7.7.6 is in the final release stage. This version contains the elements required for dynamic provisioning to better support whole machine jobs.

---++ Integration (Suchandra, Alain)


---++ Site Coordination (Marco)


---++ User Support (Chander, Mats)
   * Started planning transition of jobs/users from RENCI engage submit host; first will be Baker Lab flocking to move to UCSD
   * Need to plan the re-homing of the Virginia Tech Campus Grid flocking; who in OSG staff supports that team?
   * Recent contact with U-Maryland about connecting a 1500 core cluster to OSG.  They are part of the Bioinformatics community and are part of a gene sequencing center at http://www.igs.umaryland.edu/ . They had originally started this dialog with John !McGee (Engage) but it now makes sense to transition this work to User Support.  The idea is to connect their site in VO=osg; and they hope to get that accomplished in 1-2 months.
