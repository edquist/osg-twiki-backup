---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC is recovering from the technical stop, and preparing for the collisions (no collisions since last Monday). 
      * US ATLAS production level still not very high. Waiting for new MC tasks to be defined, as well as reprocessing of cosmic ray data, which may start today. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 3.2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 74%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 619K managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 88K jobs per day
         * failed 72K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 90%, walltime - 95%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~400TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
