      *  US ATLAS production during the week was at the average level of ~18-19K running jobs, mainly simulation type. There was a drop in production with failing jobs during the weekend after Panda Oracle update on Friday created some side effects. The problem fixed Monday with production back to normal level.
   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.2M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 92%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 540K
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was ~200TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.  
   * Issues

---++ Grid Operations Center (Rob Q.)

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
      * Glide In Factory at 97.35%. This is within acceptable SLA Level, but can we do better?
      * Heavy load leads to *CRITICAL* error. Should this be *WARNING*?
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * GGUS ticket exchange attachment feature unavailable until further notice, [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/02/ticket-exchange-attachment-interface.html][Notice]]
   * No release, 5th Tuesday
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * List of VO's in Gratia reporting has been cut from a peak of 576 down to 190.  Expect to trim 50-60 more after sites (Wisconsin, UFlorida, NERSC) answer outstanding tickets.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB release, notice to be released tomorrow
      * routine updates to TWiki, !GratiaWeb, Repo, !MyOSG
   * OS updates on ITB machines. _Note non-standard date_
      * _reboots will be required_
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Expect to reboot Gratia and ReSS machines this week for kernel updates, High availability will keep user-facing services available throughout.
   * Saturday and Sunday RSV/SAM Comparison Reports Failed
      * Due to slowness at !MyWLCG
      * This has been corrected and reports are recalculating
   * Chasing down sites that are not reporting to Gratia
      * From ticket [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11551][11551]]
