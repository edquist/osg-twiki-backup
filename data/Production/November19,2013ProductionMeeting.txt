   * General production status.
      * USATLAS total production over the last week was quite stable most of the time, at the average level around 32-35K running jobs. As grid started to run out of jobs over the weekend, the running jobs level dropped to about 15K. Monday new tasks were injected so production came back to initial levels.

      * Plan to enable content update via condor job
      * Add administrator and user defined "Probes" to enforce policy/verify content before publication
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded GOC Production factory to glideinWMS 3.2.2 on November 12th
         * Munin shows a slight increase in total CPU and memory usage in v3 vs v2, but we still have a good amount of %idle CPU and free memory available.
         * We still have no explanation for why swap space slowly fills up but overall the rate of swapping looks much lower in v3.
         * Now all production factories are running v3, so frontends can start upgrading to glideinWMS v3 as well.
      * Made HTCondor 8.0.x the default for glideins to use in all factories.
