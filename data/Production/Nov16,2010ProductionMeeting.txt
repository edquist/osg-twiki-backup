---+++ Operations Last Week 
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][Reliability/Availability of GOC Services]]
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/35zl55c][Reliability/Availability of Security Services]]
   * Production Release ([[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/11/goc-service-update-tuesday-november-9th.html][Notes]])
   * is3 is in rsync with backup, effectively adding 3rd server to GOC BDII, testing by hearty users undeway.
      * This will not be added into the Production RR until CMS/ATLAS have approved it. We are targeting November 23rd at this point. 
   * Ticket Exchange with VDT implemented in sandbox, will deploy to production 23/Nov.
   * x509 authentication notification sent out. 
      * Will send a second reminder today. 
   * Scott T. at SC10, then vacation through Thanksgiving, Rob Q. at SC10 Tue, Wed.  Both available for emergencies. 
   * !ReSS services were updated 11/10 to !ReSS 1.0.11, Condor 7.4.3, VDT 2.0.0p22.  Only OIM-registered sites now allowed to advertise to !ReSS.
      * Everything is working well so far.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * BDII Issues for BNL
      * Timeout at CERN has been increased to 120s from 30s for ldapsearches
      * The network issue seem to have been identified and fixed, error was tracked to the Indiana GigaPOP. Traffic was switched to a backup route which restored traffic flow, troubleshooting is still ongoing to find out why the link had problems to begin with.

     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Picture_3.png" alt="Picture_3.png" width='508' height='269' />    

      * We still need a final approval from ATLAS and CMS for enabling is3
   * ITB Release (Went well)
   * Automate VO list generation for DoE cert request page
   * VDT ticket exchange to ITB
   * Potential 1hr power outage @ Fermilab's Feynman Computing Center this week, would affect Gratia, !ReSS, 
     and all FermiGrid-managed gatekeepers (FNAL_FERMIGRID, FNAL_GPGRID_1).  Final time and date to 
     be confirmed.


---++ Engage (Mats, John)

Current week's total usage: 12 users utilized 44 sites;

37245 jobs total (34391 / 2854 = 92.3% success);

211523.5 wall clock hours total (203455.2 / 8068.3 = 96.2% success);

---+++ CDF

   * Processing at KISTI seems to be going well. KISTI is adding 100 dedicated nodes.
  

---+++ CompBioGrid
   * Due to new hardware purchase and reconfiguration, the site CE will be unavailable, possibly until early next year. They plan to add 512 cores.

---+++ GLUE-X
   * Highest priority jobs wait longest to get free slots. Richard will email condor-users for some help. (As of report, Richard was not pre-empting jobs.

---+++ HCC
   * Priority workflow successfully completed last weekend--110K CPU hours, 26 TB transferred. HPC continues to get good CPU cycles on OSG (~300K last weekend).

   * Open HCC tickets are being handled on HCC's behalf by the UCSD !glideinWMS team.
