---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Reprocessing of real and simulation data is now finished. Merging jobs are still running, in addition to simulation jobs. Overall production was at the level of 3k running jobs. Distribution of the reprocessed datasets is in progress. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2.4M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 67%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 756K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 108K jobs per day
         * failed 128K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 86%,  walltime - 87%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer is about the same as previous weeks, >100TB/day average, peaking ~200TB/day. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage:  Mark from USATLAS and Joel from DZERO are in contact now.

---++++ Weekly OSG Efficiency by VO for 21 February 2010

|  *Njobs*  |  *Delta*  |  *Wall*  |  *Delta*  |  *CpuToWall*  |  *Delta*  |  *%Effi*  |  *Delta*  |
|    88,732 | 21,928  | 1,033,550.7 |    343,986  |      0.60      |     -0.12 |    60  |   -12  |


   * Current week's total usage: 6 users utilized 37 sites;
      * 88953 jobs total (53806 / 35147 = 60.5% success);
      * 1058062.6 wall clock hours total (882427.1 / 175635.5 = 83.4% success);
   * Previous week's total usage: 4 users utilized 37 sites;
      * 64980 jobs total (45351 / 19629 = 69.8% success);
      * 713487.7 wall clock hours total (620271.2 / 93216.5 = 86.9% success);

---++++ LIGO / INSPIRAL

   * Just returned from SciMon duty at LIGO Hanford observatory
   * Learned how to obtain s6 data in almost real time (latency: 20 mins) and other detector related techniques

---++++ LIGO / E@H

   * production levels still very low on some major resources during weekdays:
      * !GridUNESP_CENTRAL (down due to switch problem )
      * BNL_ATLAS_1 ( up to 40 jobs running )
      * BNL_ATLAS_2 ( up to 40 jobs running  )
      * UFlorida-HPC ( -75%, due to high priority jobs )
      * LIGO_UWM_NEMO ( -75%, due to high priority jobs )
      * Purdue-RCAC ( -75%, due to high priority jobs )
      * prairiefire ( -90% )
   * production level up on:
      * USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE3 ( increased optimistic resource limit by 2k)
      * Firefly

   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/osg-ticket-exchange-11-bug-patched.html][GOC-TX 1.1 - Bug Fix release]] - Fixed bug that was causing initial assignment update by GOC staff on a ticket assigned to GGUS to not show up. ([[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8114#1265985224][An example of the problem]] - this update did not make it to [[https://gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=55511][GGUS ticket]])

      * Not related to RSV collector hosted by the GOC, which remains unaffected!
      *  IT took longer than thought because of power outage. Other than that they didn't have any issues.
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/fnal-power-outage.html][FNAL Power outage]] - and follow up notifications: [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/fnal-power-outage-update.html][Update 1]], [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2010/02/osg-docdb-access-problem.html][Update 2]]
      * All production services are up. ITB is off line working to bring back up. Not all the storage services up. They are at reduced capacity. ETA of back on-line is not ready at this time. Please let us know when UCMS tier 1  when its back to full capacity.
