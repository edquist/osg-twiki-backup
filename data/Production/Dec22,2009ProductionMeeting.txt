---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * During the last week USATLAS production was quite stable at the level of 7-8K running jobs, mainly simulation jobs. After validation is finished, reprocessing is in a good progress now, running only on T1 sites. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1021K jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 91.7%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1164K managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 166K jobs per day
         * failed 71K jobs
         * average efficiency is very good:  jobs  - 94%,  walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Transfer rate stays the same as last week. BNL T1 transferred ~75 TB/day data last week, with peak at 150 TB/day.  
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * GOC ticket 7772: Issues with WLCG BDII periodically loses information about some USATLAS Tier2 sites. Ganglia routine check in place, needs script update to check SE info.  
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage: we discussed this topic in last week's USATLAS facility meeting, there are T2 sites interested in this, more technical details to be discussed in the coming meetings. 

---++ LIGO (Britta)

  * Gratia reports:
      * 5 users utilized 31 sites
      * 15332 jobs total (11748 / 3584 = 76.6% success)
      * 112998.7 wall clock hours total (106781.0 / 6217.7 = 94.5% success)
      * Last week: 4 users utilized 38 sites
      * 52218 jobs total (45026 / 7192 = 86.2% success)
      * 423634.2 wall clock hours total (402913.4 / 20720.8 = 95.1% success

   * E@H reports
      * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 600,196.50609, Last week: 702,805.33843
      * E@H rank based on RAC: 3 (+0)
      * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 11 (+0)
   
   * Robert is working on code changes required to expand to Fermilab sites and Sprace
   * 8 GOC tickets are currently open for LIGO.
