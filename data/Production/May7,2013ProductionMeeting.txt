   * 5th Tuesday, no activity.
   * glidein-int migrated to KVM host.
   * CERN BDII problem resolved, associated with filesystem problem.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Discovered four sites reporting hundreds of millions of cpu-hours per day to Gratia.  (High CPU hours, zero wall time).  Glitch can occur in some versions of PBS to report insanely high wall times.  Fixed Purdue-Carter which is the only one that had APEL/WLCG accounting implications.  Developers thinking about putting sanity check into probes.
      * Had one site try to report all PBS data since time immemorial after a OSG 3.x update.  Have requested documentation fix.
      * Kernel reboots as scheduled on May 1 2013.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Jeff on vacation through Tuesday May 7.
      * GlowVO seems like it is experiencing some rundiff issues.  Contacted Dan Bradley about this (still waiting to hear back).
