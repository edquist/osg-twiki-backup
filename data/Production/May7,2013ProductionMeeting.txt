---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/ct2mfy6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * 5th Tuesday, no activity.
   * glidein-int migrated to KVM host.
   * CERN BDII problem resolved, associated with filesystem problem.
   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Discovered four sites reporting hundreds of millions of cpu-hours per day to Gratia.  (High CPU hours, zero wall time).  Glitch can occur in some versions of PBS to report insanely high wall times.  Fixed Purdue-Carter which is the only one that had APEL/WLCG accounting implications.  Developers thinking about putting sanity check into probes.
      * Had one site try to report all PBS data since time immemorial after a OSG 3.x update.  Have requested documentation fix.
      * Kernel reboots as scheduled on May 1 2013.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Jeff on vacation through Tuesday May 7.
      * GlowVO seems like it is experiencing some rundiff issues.  Contacted Dan Bradley about this (still waiting to hear back).

---+++ Operations This Week
   * ITB Release, note in preparation
      * banning web-bots on ticket, throwing false alarms
      * switching to OpenJDK6 on OIM, address timeout proble
   * Special 24 hour maintenance on OASIS stratum-0
      * oasis-replica to remain available
      * Increasing repository size to 6 TB
      * Long due to need to copy current content.
      * Roll-back trivial if needed.
      * Anticipate this will be an annual event.
   * CAMon - DOEGrids reporting node (unused after PKI transition) will be turned off on 5/14
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Switching glideins to 64-bit Condor and run the RHEL6 version when possible on UCSD factory.  If all goes well, we will upgrade the GOC factory as well during the next maintenance window.
