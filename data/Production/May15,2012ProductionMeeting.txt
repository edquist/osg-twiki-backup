   *WMS Glide In Factory
      * Discovered on Thurs May 10 that UCSD Factory hit file descriptor limits.
         * This prevented the factory from submitting new glideins for about 48 hours.
         * We increased the ulimit levels from the default 1024 to 10240.
         * The factory went back up successfully but we hit the limit again on Friday so we increased to  50240.
         * GlideinWMS developers are aware of it and will work on better alert system in the factory to notify of this kind of problem.
      * Began testing Condor 7.6.7 testing on ITB Factory.  Plan to upgrade GOC on next Production window.
