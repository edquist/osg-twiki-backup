   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) John, Chris, Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Rob E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Abhishek, Rob Q., Mine, Chander, Miron, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Computing: 101 khour/day, 91% success.
   * OSG All Hands meeting was productive
   * Expect many Tier 3s to begin ramp-up in a few months
   * LHC status: Technical Stop -- ramp studies to 3.5 <nop>TeV/beam scheduled for tomorrow evening CET.  First sqrt(s) = 7 <nop>TeV collisiions tentatively scheduled for 3/30.

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Last week the production was quite stable with simulation jobs at the average level of 7K running jobs. LHC commissioning is in progress. Very short collision run on Sunday with 1.18TeV per beam. Studies with 3.5TeV per beam energies during the week. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.4M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 202K jobs per day
         * failed 118K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer is ~100 TB/day. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage: D0 expert Robert Illingworth explained to us what's needed to run D0 data transfer etc, Mark at UTA USATLAS T2 will verify that D0 workflow works with the current clients available on our T2s. 
      * T3 sites are looking for instructions of publishing the SE information to cern BDII. Is there standalone package of installing and configuring just CEMon for a site?

   * *GOC-TX*
      * *FNAL Remedy*
         * Some firewall issues were worked out by Remedy staff but still no access for GOC; the remainder of problems being worked out at FNAL
      * *GGUS*
         * Only remaining ticket that was still using old email-based ticket exchange mechanism: [[https://gus.fzk.de/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=54674][GGUS ticket 54674]] (corresponding GOC ticket: [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7961][7961]]) was closed. No more GGUS-GOC tickets using old email based exchange.
         * Change to Affected Site behavior postponed. Production release scheduled on March 10th was initially going to include a change from resource_name to resource_group_name for the Affected Site parameter. Per GOC/OSG request, this change was postponed to early April. GOC's March 30th update to GOC-TX will include code that can handle existing and new values for that field.
