   * General production status
      * Last week the production was quite stable with simulation jobs at the average level of 7K running jobs. LHC commissioning is in progress. Very short collision run on Sunday with 1.18TeV per beam. Studies with 3.5TeV per beam energies during the week. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 2M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 88%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed successfully 1.4M managed MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 202K jobs per day
         * failed 118K jobs
         * average efficiency:  jobs  - 92%,  walltime - 97%
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer is ~100 TB/day. 
   * Issues and GOC Tickets
      * Opening more USATLAS T2 sites to D0 VO as opportunistic storage: D0 expert Robert Illingworth explained to us what's needed to run D0 data transfer etc, Mark at UTA USATLAS T2 will verify that D0 workflow works with the current clients available on our T2s. 
      * T3 sites are looking for instructions of publishing the SE information to cern BDII. Is there standalone package of installing and configuring just CEMon for a site?
