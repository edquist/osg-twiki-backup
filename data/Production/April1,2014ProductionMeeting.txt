      * DOEgrids ca will completely shutdown on april 25th, that is the crl service will be gone. 
      * In the IGTF's april release, there are lots of changes: 
         * removing DOEGrids roots. if sites do not get this ca bundle and remove the doegrids ca, they will receive a rsv failures. sites only need to upgrade to the new CA bundle; they do not need to take any other action. 
         * including new DigiCert SHA-2 roots. All osg certs will be signed by these new roots soon. More on this below. 
         * Switching to the new layout for the ca bundle. We will not release the ca bundle in the old format. 
      * New DigiCert roots are coming. Our sites must install the new CA bundle asap because all certs from now on wil be signed by the new roots. How much grace period we should give our sites before digicert roots start signing certs?
