---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Marcia, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC continue to run stable heavy ion collisions. Collected luminosity has more than doubled during the last week and is now 6800 mb-1. The interesting physics results on jet asymmetry at heavy ion collisions, mentioned last week, got endorsed by ATLAS collaboration, the paper was ready and submitted for publication at PRL Thursday, and was accepted the very next day. Also dedicated CERN Press Release on Friday. ATLAS data reprocessing campaign successfully finished end of the week. At the moment majority of running jobs are Geant4 simulation tasks. Production is quite stable at the level of ~10k running jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 83%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * Failure rate raised on Nov 23, due to some software installation problem (some compat libraries were accidentally deleted). 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 400~500TB/day.
   * Issues

---+++ Gratia Reports
   * This week's total usage: 4 users utilized 28 sites
      * 82259 jobs total (23741 / 58518 = 28.9% success)
      * 433804.0 wall clock hours total (310963.9 / 122840.1 = 71.7% success)
   * Last week's total usage: 5 users utilized 32 sites
      * 93112 jobs total (33040 / 60072 = 35.5% success)
      * 521261.9 wall clock hours total (330553.0 / 190708.9 = 63.4% success)

---+++ LIGO / E@OSG
   * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 1,080,480.45195, Last Week:  1,238,130.94941
   * E@H rank based on RAC:  2(-1)
   * E@H rank based on accumulated credits: 3

---+++ LIGO / INSPIRAL

   * PEGASUS 3.0 RELEASE TESTING
      * In progress

   * FILE TRANSFERS
      * Successfully transferred data into 6 OSG SEs
      * Testing SBGrid-Harvard-East: stage out job fails 
 
   * TESTS WITH SRM SETUP
      * CIT_CMS_T2: currently running on 3 day data set
      * Nebraska: 3 day data set run finished successfully
      * OUHEP_OSG: 32 bit cluster

   * GLIDEINS
      * Running with new Pegasus 3.0 release  ( bugfix that should improve performance)
      * Mats made some configuration changes that should improve performance
      * troubleshooting fails
