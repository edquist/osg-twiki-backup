-- Main.DanFraser - 15 Nov 2010
---++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/WeeklyProductionMeetings

---++ Action/Significant Items:
   * 

---++ Attendees:
   * (to be updated after the meeting) Mats, Xin, Armen, Britta, Robert E., Brian, Suchandra, Burt, Marco, Marcia, Rob Q., Scott T., Mine, Chander, Dan
 
---++ CMS (Burt)
   * Job statistics for last week
      * ~924 khours/day
      * 19696 jobs/day
      * 89% success

   * Transfer statisics for last week
      * ~362 TB/day

---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * LHC continue to run stable heavy ion collisions. Collected luminosity has more than doubled during the last week and is now 6800 mb-1. The interesting physics results on jet asymmetry at heavy ion collisions, mentioned last week, got endorsed by ATLAS collaboration, the paper was ready and submitted for publication at PRL Thursday, and was accepted the very next day. Also dedicated CERN Press Release on Friday. ATLAS data reprocessing campaign successfully finished end of the week. At the moment majority of running jobs are Geant4 simulation tasks. Production is quite stable at the level of ~10k running jobs. 
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.5M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 83%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * Failure rate raised on Nov 23, due to some software installation problem (some compat libraries were accidentally deleted). 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate last week was 400~500TB/day.
   * Issues

---++ Metrics (Brian)

For once, a few production-related metrics issues:
   * We've noticed the NERSC allocation is about half-used.  How would OSG like to go about managing the remaining hours?  Does it want to think more deeply about how it allocates this between VOs?  Or does it simply want to see it utilized?
   * For VOs that span multiple fields of science, Metrics keeps a mapping of "user DN" to "field of science".  We're missing such a mapping from GLOW.  Background information: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/MeasurementsAndMetrics/MetricScienceUsage
