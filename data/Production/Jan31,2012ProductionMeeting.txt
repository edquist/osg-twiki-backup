---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/42j3mgl][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * Production Release
      * Production rack maintenance, [[http://mypage.iu.edu/~steige/Rack_Power.png][Result.]] Total load dropped from 6.2 kW to less than 5.0 kW.
      * Service update [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/goc-service-update-tuesday-january-24th.html][Release note]]
      * CMS Ticket Exchange (GOC to FNAL Service Now) went fully live. 
         * Other FNAL VOs to follow on next production window. 
   * Software 1.2.26 Release [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/osg-1226-software-release.html][Release Notification]]
   * XSEDE server and storage are up and running, storage formatted, OS installed.
   * Web pages outages at Tilted Planet. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/problems-accessing-opensciencegridorg_24.html][Notification 1]] and [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2012/01/problems-accessing-opensciencegridorg.html][Ticket 2]].
   * Found bug is VOMS RPM Configuration which caused high load and memory usage if more than one VO was used. 
      * Fixed with a documentation update that specifically allocates memory for Tomcat5. 
   *  WMS Glide In Factory
      * Discovered unexpected behavior where condor-g does not forward updated proxy to CE unless there is < 6h left on it even if it was updated on submit node.
         * This creates a window where glideins fail because gwms internally sets a 12h lower limit for minimum time left on a proxy a glidein is allowed to start with.
         * Jaime Frey gave us a gridmanager to test that allows us to change the 6h condor limit.  We will test it this week.
         * We notified gwms developers as well.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Fifth Tuesday, no release.
   * opensciencegrid.org Domain transfer to IU postponed to February 28th maintenance window. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OpenScienceGridWeb][Planning Document]]
   * Meeting to design new www.opesciencegrid.org webpage scheduled next week.
   * Meeting to discuss Condor usage Gratia probes scheduled for Wednesday morning [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRATIA-34][Ticket]].
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Still may test condor 7.6.6 on ITB Factory this week but will focus on testing Jaime's new gridmanager first.

---+++ Gratia Review
   * I noticed these numbers on Weekly Gratia report. I've begun to create tickets to see if we can identify why these sites are being reported and fix them.
      * 23 registered sites have stopped reporting (15% of OSG Sites)
      * 27 registered sites have never reported (18% of OSG Sites)
      * [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/11551][Parent Ticket]]
   * No obvious oddities on gratiaweb reports.
