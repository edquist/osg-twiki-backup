   * Job statistics for last week.      
      * Gratia report: 1.5M pilot jobs run on USATLAS sites, with CPU/walltime ratio of 91%  
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 1M
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * Data transfer rate was 200~400TB/day at BNL T1 in last week.

   * !FermiGrid Ops
      * Large backup in gratia reporting database beginning on Sat. 3/31/2012.  Investigating cause. Have failed over reporting to main gratia database until we understand it.
      * VOMS 2.0 / VOMS-Admin 2.6 was deployed at voms.fnal.gov and voms.opensciencegrid.org on Wednesday 3/28.
   * WMS Glide In Factory
      * Upgraded GOC Production Factory to use condor 7.6.6 during production window on Tuesday
         * Reduced number of schedds for glidein submission from 20 to 9 and slowed submission rates to ensure we don't hit load problems.
      * Discovered held job auto removal behavior in glideinWMS 2.5.6 still not working properly
         * Igor found a bug and patched the UCSD Factory, it seemed to improve.
