---++ Site Coordination (Marco)
Survey about sites updating to OSG 1.0.1 (<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/MyCollector_Detail.aspx?sm=yzJizU8aQ6JuSg3qsf3tfEMsuID6CMHuBzSd0Ezuq3nErKeMDM2Wsm8Nny2p%2fWa5">link here</a>):
   * verify update/install experiences
   * ask for date for planned update (if not updated)
Very few answers: 8 system administrators (for a total of 14 sites).
Generally the update/install procedure was rated difficult: sysadmin were able to complete it only thanks to help/support                                                                                          

Some comments from site administrators  below:
        <p>Bestman would not work, it did not maintain the gums support. Alex Sims helped me out. GUMS didn't work at all, the config file wasn't using the new mysql database. CEMon is broke, and still is. Not reporting to BDII and ReSS servers. No idea why not.</p>
        <p>I was having problems with my current 1.0.0 install (not reporting to RSV) just in the days of version transition, and I had not noticed the "don't upgrade now" email, so when I tried to uninstall and reinstall some packages, pacman got confused. At that point I just did a full clean install, which happened to fetch 1.0.1; I only had to do some minor modifications to the config.ini, which were anyway very easy. In general I like that the pacman installs are nicely automated, but I'm not happy that it does not keep a local cache of the installed packages (bandwidth is not abundant in South Africa; I had to install a special squid to cache the large package files), and that it does not integrate with the OS packaging system for conflict/dependency checks. It's also more difficult to recover a failed/incomplete install (than with YUM as used by gLite). On the positive side, it does not suffer from the "package dependency nightmares" that I'm seeing with gLite.</p>
        <p>The vdt-updater was a little too picky when processing user input ('y' vs. 'yse'). cemon had some stale data that did not get cleaned up until I randomly                                                  
removed some cached files and waited several hours for it to clean itself up. GIP bugs prevented proper associations between my two CEs and SEs. Other issues were posted to the osg mailing list and got responses very quickly.</p>

Other notes:
   * Some site admin did not answer because they have no plans about the update and are waiting to answer the survey                                                                                                             
   * This week I'll send a reminder and close the survey.

---++ Engagement (Mats)

<verbatim>
-------------------------------------------------------
| VO             | # of Jobs | Wall Dur. | Cpu / Wall |

</verbatim>

Good week for Engagement. Only production issue was a VO member staging
larger input data using the Condor-G file staging mechanism. The result
was quota overages and a ticket from FNAL. The Engagement Team helped
the user improve his data staging and caching.



---++ Metrics (Brian)
   * End of month metrics available here: http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/jot_reporting.  This is missing 1/2 month's data from MIT (GOC #6957) and 2 days of data from Nebraska (GOC #6958).  Chris is following up on the missing data.
   * RSV Reports haven't gone out in a day or two; got a note from Arvind stating that he was debugging the issue.  I think I've tracked down the issue to database slowness at the GOC.  Last time, I got around this by increasing timeouts; it will hopefully be fixed in time for tonight's report.
   * Ongoing projects:
      * OIMv2: Migration of all my projects to OIMv2 is complete; only remaining known error is the above RSV reports
      * Installed Capacity: Karthik is restarting some of this work as OIMv2 is now functioning.
      * Gratia: Some folks missed my previous live display link.  Currently at http://gratia.fnal.gov/Files/osg_gratia_display/today/live_display.png .
