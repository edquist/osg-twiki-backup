-- Main.DanFraser - 28 Apr 2009
---+!! Background Analysis 
Sites are now (and in the next few months) receiving funds for setting up T3s.
   * Typical funds are on the order of $30-50K,  This is less than what some had anticipated. Hence these new T3s are expected to be "small".
   * Operating resources are expected to be small, some fraction of a graduate student who may or may not be a "trained" Admin.
   * Atlas is anticipating as many as ~20 new sites coming online over the next few months.
   * (Need data from CMS)

In the case of Atlas, there are seven OSG T3 sites (need the OSG names). There are approximately 15?? other sites although these primarily use DQ2 to get data from T2's remotely and do not currently run an OSG stack. Those running an OSG stack are:
   * ANL (SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)?
   * U-Chicago (SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)
   * U- Wisconsin (SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)
   * University of Texas/Dallas (SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)
   * Louisiana Tech (SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)
   * Hampton (SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)
   * Tufts(SRM + CE + PanDA + DCache)

There are two main reasons why sites deploy CEs:
   * To enable their resources to be shared with other grid users
   * To provide a common interface between grid jobs submitted locally and off-site jobs

In the case of Atlas:
   * All (or nearly all) jobs are submitted via PanDA and users do not directly interface to CEs.
   * Enabling the same job submission interface on local resources implies that sites must install PanDA software as well as DDM software. Three of the existing T3s that are already on OSG do this already. This type of infrastructure layer implies a significant amount of overhead that can be handled by more mature T3 sites with ~1FTE to support them. It is not recommended for new or beginning sites.
   * Most of the new T3s coming online are not expected to share resources.
   * Hence the conclusion is that most Atlas T3s will NOT need to install a CE.

There are ?? main reasons why sites deploy SEs:
   * Access to data on T2 sites can be automated by means of an SE.
   * SEs provide a uniform access layer for moving large amounts of data both locally and off-site.

---++ Background
CMS -
   * There are seven Tier-2s, and the number is constant
   * T3s are looking more like a growth industry
      * Currently 20-T3s in the US (38 internationally)
      * 10 of these are registered as OSG sites
      * Could be as many as 20 new T3s in the next few years
      * Registration in OSG is a grass-roots effort (the better the perceived benefit, the more will join)
      * There is a 1/2 time CMS T3 support person and a full time T3 CMS liason
Atlas -
   * Expecting a similar growth pattern as CMS
   * A coherent client package for data replication (e.g. from Tier-2 to Tier-3) and data access is needed
   * Currently creating a T3 support group
      * Doug B. 1/2 time support, and planning another dedicated person
---++ High Level Goals
   1 Create two Storage Element (SE) "shrink-wrapped" packages that can be easily installed and managed on T3s
      * Storage Elements are the most important (and most difficult) component of T3s.
      * Create one package for small ~20TB sites, and another for Larger systems
         * Current installation mechanism is difficult for T3s
      * Specify the architecture, configuration, and operation of each system
         * Can benchmark these so that we can specify the capabilities & scalability of each system
      * Designed with input from CMS, Atlas, and the OSG storage team
         * Current thinking is that these patterns could be the same both Atlas and CMS
      * Perhaps security patches can be packaged specifically for these patterns
   1 Create a set of OSG policies for T3s similar to the T2 specifications
      * Look at T2 policies and identify which are applicable
      * Maintaining T3 security is a priority issue

---++ Additional Considerations
   * With the anticipated growth of T3s, T3s may eventually be able to overwhelm the sites w/data requests
      * Requiring access via FTS is one possible way of managing this.
