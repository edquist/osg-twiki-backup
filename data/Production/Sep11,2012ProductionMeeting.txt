         * Globus team is still looking into other issues found there;
         * Once the current patch is in the new stable release, we plan to upgrade current USATLAS OSG3 sites to the latest version, and run for a month or so. If things are stable, we can move forward with wider adoption. If not stable, we start another round of troubleshooting.
