---++ CMS (Burt)


---++ Atlas (Armen & Xin)

   * General production status
      * Continuing stable operation of LHC, and good accumulated luminosity during the past week. Operating with 1092 bunches for now. Additional 230pb-1 luminosity accumulated this week, bringing total collected luminosity for ATLAS to about 950pb-1.
      * US ATLAS production was quite stable at the average level of about 12k running jobs, mostly simulation.
   * Job statistics for last week. 
      * Gratia report: USATLAS ran 1.6M jobs, with CPU/Walltime ratio of 92%. 
      * Panda world-wide production report (real jobs): 
         * completed 1.4M managed group, MC production, validation and reprocessing jobs 
         * average 196K jobs per day
         * failed 106K jobs 
         * average efficiency:  jobs - 93%
      * Real Jobs processed by US sites for last week, reported from PanDA monitor 
         * 815K 
   * Data Transfer statistics for last week
      * BNL T1 data transfer rate was around 200~300TB/day in last week. 
   * Issues
      * OSG opportunistic access to USATLAS sites: 
         * HCC: no change, working in progress on 3 T2 sites (BU, HU, WT2).
         * Engage: attended USATLAS facility meeting, discussed VO's requirements and applications; will start with a straightforward application. 
      * update of LFC in VDT/OSG client packages : preliminary version under testing

---+++ Operations Last Week
   * [[http://tinyurl.com/27fknc6][GOC Services Availability/Reliability]]
   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * !MyOSG outage. 
      * One instance ran out of memory, removed from DNS RR. People may have observed long response times. VM restarted with twice the memory.
      * When the second instance was to be removed from RR, IU DNS administrators erroneously removed _both_ instances from RR. !MyOSG became invisible sometime after 3:00 eastern Friday. The problem was corrected at 4:00.
      * Second instance had memory doubled this morning

   * Half of our machines moved between buildings.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory

---+++ Operations This week

   * Production release. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2011/06/goc-service-update-tuesday-june-14th-at.html][Release notes]] exist.
   * Lifecycle replacement servers have arrived.
   * Glide-in server is through purchasing.

---++++ Gratia and !ReSS (Represented by !FermiGrid Ops)

   * Nothing planned.

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Plan to upgrade factory to use Condor 7.6.1 on Tuesday June 21 (next week)

---++ Security (Mine)
   * Change in DOEgrids CA certificate. We are doing an ITB test starting today. DOEgrids requested to make this test asap. Does not affect any end user certificates
   * New IGTF release is coming up on the week of 27th. DOEgrids wants to make their release into this IGTF distribution. that is why we do an out-of-cycle cert test. We worked out a plan with DOEgrids that if the test fail, we will delay taking the new certificate (and possibly the IGTF distribution) until it works. 
   * All core service owners will have received their remaining security controls by the end of this week. Thanks everyone who replied so far.
   * Had a Torque security vulnerability. Found two sites in OSG and contacted them. No other serious vulnerabilities. 
   * Still we have no resolution on voms-admin vulnerability.
