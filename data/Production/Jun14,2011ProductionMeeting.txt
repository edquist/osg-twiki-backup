   * [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/miscstatus/index?datasource=status&count_sg_1=on&count_active=on&count_enabled=on][Current Status]]
   * !MyOSG outage. 
      * One instance ran out of memory, removed from DNS RR. People may have observed long response times. VM restarted with twice the memory.
      * When the second instance was to be removed from RR, IU DNS administrators erroneously removed _both_ instances from RR. !MyOSG became invisible sometime after 3:00 eastern Friday. The problem was corrected at 4:00.
      * Second instance had memory doubled this morning
