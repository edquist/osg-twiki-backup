---++++ !FermiGrid Ops

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
   * Igor continued to investigate high load at UCSD and CERN Factories.  Applied patch at UCSD to serialize condor_status and condor_advertize processes.  It seemed to help.
   * Added all T1 sites to UCSD factory that CERN supports for CMS Production / MC
   * Replaced gridmanager at UCSD factory with a patched version to fix a bug when submitting to new ARC CEs.
   * Suchandra and I worked on installing the glidein-int factory, which will be used to test ITB sites.  It is mostly finished but I am not done testing the installation to verify everything works as expected.

---+++ Operations This Week
   * Production release
      * OS updates will require server reboots.
      * glidein.grid.iu.edu and osg-xsede.grid.iu.edu tentatively scheduled for noon (eastern) reboot.

---++++ !FermiGrid Ops
   * Upgrading VOMS

---++++ WMS Glide In Factory
