---+ OSG Auditing 

---++ Mission
The mission of this project is to provide a global level auditing service to the Open Science Grid Community (OSG). The global auditing service is necessary to assess the overall security condition of the OSG across OSG sites and Virtual Organization (VO) specific services. 

We plan to work with Globus on their Auditing activities, [[http://http://www.cedps.net/wiki/index.php/Troubleshooting][CEDPS  on their Troubleshooting Project]], with OSG on their [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome][Accounting Project (Gratia)]]  and with the Security Staff of OSG. 

If you have questions or comments about this please send mail to [[mailto:osg-etp@opensciencegrid.org][osg-etp@opensciencegrid.org]]
---++ Problem Statement

The cyberspace defined by the OSG goes beyond organizational boundaries. The nature of the Grid cyberspace security vulnerabilities provides a motivation for creation of centralized service for real-time automated security assessment and forensic analysis. 

Many sites that are participating in the OSG activities are already providing the audit service relevant to their site. However, the usage patterns across the Grid may reveal adverse intentions while similar behavior may seem legitimate to any particular grid site or VO specific service. For example, the auditing service should be able to determine if a specific, presumed to be stolen credential has been used to access Grid Sites or VO services, or find out if there was an attempt to enter a site or service by scanning.  

---++ Goals

In order to satisfy the mission, the OSG Auditing will need to:
   * offer a real-time automated security assessment and forensic analysis tools that will satisfy the security requirements of OSG Staff, VOs and sites participating in the OSG.
   * provide flexible query interfaces needed to ad hoc security investigations at the grid level. 
   * be able to interface OSG  Information Management Project in case of discovery of unusual or suspicious gird usage that diverges from expected behavior. 
   * allow for the implementation of grid security processes that complement the existing site security processes and help drive further development of auditing collection software used by Grid Sites. 
   * focus on integration and analysis of the, possibly diverse and multiple-format, information.
