---+ OSG Auditing Activity Home Page

---++ Mission
To ensure that GRID Services create a suitable audit trail. To provide tools to the site to gather audit events, process them, correlate them, in order to facilitate post-mortem investigations and malicious use detection.

---++ Goals

In order to satisfy the mission, the OSG Auditing Activity aims to:
	* Define a *lightweight* process for which a GRID Service can be certified as auditable. Let me stress again: *lightweight*. This means: provide clear guidance for the developers on how to create an outstanding audit log (i.e. a document that can be fully digested by the average developer in less then 30 minutes); provide a review process for which cybersecurity can review the logs to certify that the logs contain all and only the relevant information (i.e. a one hour session with a security expert and the main developer in which they go through the log, and answer a set of predefined questions).
	* Review the current auditing status of critical services, such as GRAM and gridFTP. Development on these services will very very likely be necessary.
	* Create a system that collects the auditing events from the audit logs, and makes them available for querying through a central site EventServer.
	* Create a suitable user interface to query the EventServer and display the results. Concepts for the UI available at AuditingUIConcept
	* Create a system to detect malicious usage of the facility.
	* Investigate auditing accross site boundaries.
