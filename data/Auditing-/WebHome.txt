---+ OSG Auditing 

---++ Mission
To ensure that GRID Services create a suitable audit trail. To provide tools to the site to gather audit events, process them, correlate them, in order to facilitate post-mortem investigations and malicious use detection.

At present there is no OSG activity working on Auditing. While we know the need is there the effort is currently not.

We plan to work with Globus on their Auditing activities and with the Security for Open Science project once hoped for funding is available. 

If you have questions or comments about this please send mail to [[mailto:osg-etp@opensciencegrid.org][osg-etp@opensciencegrid.org]]
---++ Goals

In order to satisfy the mission, the OSG Auditing will need to:
   * Define a *lightweight* process for which a GRID Service can be certified as auditable; provide a review process for which cybersecurity can review the logs to certify that the logs contain all and only the relevant information (i.e. a one hour session with a security expert and the main developer in which they go through the log, and answer a set of predefined questions).
   * Review the current auditing status of critical services, such as [[GramLog][GRAM]] and gridFTP. Development on these services will  likely be necessary.
   * Create a system that collects the auditing events from the audit logs, and makes them available for querying through a central site EventServer.
   * Create a suitable user interface to query the EventServer and display the results. Concepts for the UI available at AuditingUIConcept
   * Create a system to detect malicious usage of the facility.
   * Investigate auditing accross site boundaries.
