---+ Log quality scores

We give a score on each of the following areas to judge if a service log is suitable for auditing.

---++ Ease of parse

	1. Perfect - Each event is in a single line and format is predictible.
	1. Possible - It can be parsed. Events are on a single line, or on few lines easily correlated. Consistent format. Errors have all the same format.
	1. Doable - It can be parsed, but it's a big effort. Events are on multiple lines, though can be related; errors event have a significant different format than normal events and/or within each other; a lot of cases and subcases.
	1. Difficult - In theory the information is parsable, but in practice it's impossible. Information scattered in multiple files that need to be correlated' events on multiple lines; each entry have a different format; too many cases to handle.
	1. Impossible - Events are on multiple lines, mixed with each other; no way of knowing to which event anything relates to; format is incoherent; some values break the formatting. Or, the log is simply missing.

---++ Information

	1. Complete - All information necessary for an audit trail is present.
	1. Lacking - Most of the information is there, minus a few details. All operations that change state are distinguishible, it is clear who requested them, and what was the result. Some information from events is missing.
	1. Insufficient - There is some informations to be able to guess what has happened, but not the details. Operations on the service are not distinguishible from one another; some events are missing; some critical information is missing.
	1. Non-existing - The information provided is not useful to reconstruct any kind of trail; information doesn't seem to be reliable.
