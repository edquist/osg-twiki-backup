Present: Alain, Rob, Chander, Ruth

Agenda:

1. Status and signoff on LHC Client tools: <a target="_top" href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/pub/Management/20080904ETAgendaMinutes/vdt-lhc-client-tools-v2.doc" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #4571d0; background-color: transparent">vdt-lhc-client-tools-v2.doc </a>- Alain

FKW signed off functionality. Would like tools in Client as well as WN package.

ATLAS signed off on LFC client. Some more testing in progress of the server.

Alain will release soon. Hand off between VDT and OSG. Release in VDT automatically updates the OSG packages. because OSG pacman cache refers to the VDT pacman cache and gets the latest version of the VDT 1.10 cache - so patches are automatically picked up by the OSG cache. People will need to be reminded to do a pacman update. The RSV probe does pick up the patch level on that machine.

This happens for minor releases/patches: ie when 1 or j changes in the following syntax: VDT 1.10.1j

2. RSV, making it mandatory and removing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS (http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/)- Rob Q

At present the MIS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is mandatory and then "site_verify" can be run centrally.

Who are the Users of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS information: Nanohub (manually), OSG, Panda, LIGO? Rob will monitor the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS web site to find out who is using it and will ask the VOs - through the Miron/Ruth/Chander, Abhishek - at large VOs, Engage (Mats) and Education (Alina). 

Alain uses it to learn about where a site is and information about the site.

Operations uses this to alert sites that they are not working. Starting to use the RSV reports centrally at the operations dashboard. About 50% of sites currently report. GOC would not be able to report basic problems at a site. Rob Gardner would like RSV to help sites improve. 

Probes needed will be part of RSV Phase III project plan (By end of FY08 talk to Software Tools Group)

Display allows viewing of not just RSV information. Includes BDII data. Include BDII validation. Can link in OIM. "one stop shopping" for information available to OSG for a particular site and/or a particular VO. All information is available in a programmatic interface as well as on the display. Frank/CMS is requesting "one stop shopping" for all information available to OSG at a Site itself. Tanya/Storage tools - "one stop shopping" for all information related to Storage for a Site. GOC display would follow the model of being able to install/display the information locally at a site. 

Alain - need to clean up some things in RSV. Should not push RSV harder at the present. Will write diagnostic tools to follow up. Will take weeks-couple of months. 

3. LHC Grid Fest - status, OSG-wide umbrella - Ruth.

Present at the Area Coordinators next Thursday. 

4. Year 3 SOW Sign-off process flow - Chander

5. Year 2 WBS completion/closeout plans - Chander
