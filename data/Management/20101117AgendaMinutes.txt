---++ 1.0.1 Software Tools Group

We last reported to the Area Coordinators at the [[20100826AgendaMinutes][August 26th, 2010 meeting]].

We continue to have meetings on an as-needed basis. Given that a lot of the software that OSG owns is in a steady state right now, that means that we have not had frequent meetings. 

---+++ GUMS 

We were hoping to ship a new release of GUMS by the beginning of October. This would not only be the first release since Jay Packard left, but it would also be our first release where the VDT team built GUMS from source. To date, it hasn't happened because the GUMS team (Dave Stampf and John Hover) are working on stamping out the last couple of bugs. We have high hopes for a release "soon", but given the regular delays, we are not predicting a release date. 

---+++ RSV

A new release of RSV is about to go into production. This includes new changes that make it much easier for system administrators to configure RSV. It also includes several long-delayed additions to set of RSV metrics, including Brian Bockelman's information services metrics, Parag Mhashilkar's RESS metrics, and Doug Strain's new Storage Element metrics. 

---+++ Pigeon Tools

There is a new software component from the OSG Storage Group at Fermilab to help a VO test a set of sites for access to storage elements. After some initial difficulties, these new "Pigeon Tools" are a thin layer on top of existing RSV metrics. We are pleased because we minimized the set of software that needed to be developed while still providing a tool that meets the needs of smaller VOs who need help accessing OSG sites. 

---+++ Bestman 2 from source

We are finally shipping Bestman 2 as built by the VDT from source code! Well, it's in final testing on the ITB, with the new release expected before Thanksgiving.
