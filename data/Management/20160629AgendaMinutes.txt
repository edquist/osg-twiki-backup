---++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. HRCondor-CE-Bosco - released and under testing at 4 sites. Investigating missing gratia records.
   2. GRACC: July development milestones mostly complete. Testing: ingest data rate at 200 Hz is 5-10x faster than Gratia; 30days summarization takes 30s.
   3. Expanding LIGO's access to OSG resources

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Need more developers on adapting GRACC software.
   2. Seeking a few more big opportunistic sites for CVMFS 2.2.x upgrade.
   3. To make progress, BDII retirement needs focus from technology staff already busy.

Key Accomplishments
   1. StashCache - Successful production workflow by OSG VO user. Shipped new version of cvmfs (v2.2.0); addressed site support issues. Expanding deployment of StashCache repo, now available on 20% of OSG VO pool.
