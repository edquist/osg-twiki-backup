by Igor Sfiligoi

Activity list for the past 3 months:
   * Condor/glideinWMS R&D and testing
      * Tested 7.5.5 pre-release(s) - found and reported multiple problems that were fixed before the official release
      * Measured negotiator speed - O(10Hz)
      * Achieved 60k+ running jobs on a single schedd (memory limited)
      * Tested Condor behavior using [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/CondorTCPTest][TCP vs UDP]] (no good reason not to use TCP)
      * Tested glideinWMS v2_5 pre-release and provided feedback
      * Helping with OSG glideinWMS operations
   * Storage testing
      * New round of [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/DCTest][dCache SE tests]] - no change
      * New round of [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/StoragePerformanceTest][Bestman+Hadoop tests]] - no change
      * In talks with ATLAS to get access to a xrootd SE
   * CREAM
      * Debugging CREAM client (Condor-G) issues for the OSG gfactory - mostly minor things and better error message propagation
      * Worked with European sites to get the CREAM servers properly configured - CMS now able to use gfactory on most European CREAM sites
   * Writing proceedings for CHEP (pre-prints at
      [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1015][OSG Doc 15]] , 
      [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1016][OSG Doc 16]] ,
      [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1017][OSG Doc 17]] )
