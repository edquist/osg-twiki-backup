---+++Ongoing Items last reported on Feb 11, 2010

   * hiring: have selected a candidate, procedural issues with UNC hr requiring a repost of the position, will be able to make an offer in 30 days.
   * usage demand remains reasonably strong; increasing demand for HTPC

 
---+++ New issues
   * TG10 Tutorial was accepted 
   * Notre Dame CI Days tutorial completed, article submitted for OSG newsletter
   * working closely with WUSTL: call with Tanya, conversations with BrianB. Issue is large amount of data that needs to be available at the CE for computations (eg BLAST databases). severly limits the number of OSG sites this work can run on.
   * Have requested papers/citations from user community in prep for June 2010 NSF report. Have received two from Jose Caballero, though it's not entirely clear if these are Engagement. they are citations however.
   * have been having some issues with one users code segfaulting and difficulty in communicating with them, in final round of communication before elevating to talk with their PI
   * Interested in gathering input, ideas, feedback, comments on Next Gen OSG Engagement 




---++ 1.7 Security
---+++Ongoing Items last reported on Feb25, 2010

   * The new certificate layout from IGTF. We made a plan for ITB testing. the new CA package have been created and put into ITB testing. It will be tested by the robot job submission system (panda). Currently, rsv and some cert scripts have been broken. 
   * Pakiti testing has been completed. The code that provides access control per sys admin is completed and tested. We are waiting to check out the official release version. We tested with the development repository. 
   * We held the successive ID Mgmt meeting at OSG All Hands Meeting. As a short term solution, we decided to prepare an OSG specific certificate request web page. We completed the page and we are testing the page on different browsers. We made a survey of RA Agents to understand desired features of the new page. As a result, we incorporated the VO specific sponsor information on the page. In the past, an end user was supposed to know this information and they struggled identifying their sponsors. Our next steps are to test the usability of the page with VO agents. If the results turn out to be positive, we will direct OSG users to this web page rather than DOEGrids web page. 
   * End-end authentication infrastructure. We started writing the authentication roadmap for the next cycle of the OSG. Met with CMS web group which is building an openID based solution. 
   * CRL distribution problem. FNAL is experimenting with running a central distribution server. We will wait until they gather some results. 
 
---+++ New issues
   * GUMS testing. Dave Stampf is coming to FNAL during the week June 21. I will also start building the code with Maven to understand the process. 
   * We are visiting SBgrid in June to work on their authentication infrastructure. We found ways to further reduce their registration workflow. 
   * Documentation work is continuing. Barlow is leading this effort
   * We performed a security audit of NEBioGrid per executive director's request. The results are published at docdb.  
   * A new security challenge is performed by EGEE against atlas infrastructure. We are working to understand what is tested and how.
