---++ Introduction
The Extending Science Through Enhanced National !CyberInfrastructure ([[http://tinyurl.com/NSF-ExTENCI][ExTENCI]]) Project is a joint OSG and !TeraGrid project, funded by the NSF OCI, with the goal to: *Develop and provide a production-quality enhancement to the National !CyberInfrastructure that allows specific science applications to use both diverse high performance and high throughput resources, ideally for production science runs.*

The project PIs are Paul Avery (University of Florida), Ralph Roskies (Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center), and Dan Katz (University of Chicago).  The project is organized around four technology components that are designed to provide new capabilities for specific science applications to run on either !TeraGrid or OSG.

---++ Technology Components
The technology components, supported science, and responsible leader are listed in the following table.
| *Technology* | *Science(s)* | *Leader(s)* |
| Distributed File System (Lustre-WAN) | CMS/ATLAS HEP | Ralph Roskies |
| Virtual Machines | STAR & CMS | Carol Song / Sebastian Goasguen |
| Workflow & Client Tools | SCEC & Protein Folding | Dan Katz |
