First solicitation is to the OSG Organizational PIs.

But we do not preclude someone hiring and will take note of the what the other 50% would be. Add a desired start date: ASAP. make it clear that the Security Officer is a key person in the discussion; the request has come from the Security Officer to fill the gap. Chander will send the email on behalf of Miron and Ruth.
