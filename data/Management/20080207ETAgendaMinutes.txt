First solicitation is to the OSG Organizational PIs. Prepared to consider responses where the organization would plan to hire in order to fill the responsibilities.Preference is to find someone already on board. But we do not preclude someone hiring and will take note of the what the other 50% would be. Add a desired start date: ASAP. make it clear that the Security Officer is a key person in the discussion; the request has come from the Security Officer to fill the gap. Chander will send the email on behalf of Miron and Ruth.
