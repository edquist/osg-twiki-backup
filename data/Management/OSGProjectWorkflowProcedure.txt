Creating of a spreadsheet logging all of the OSG projects requested by OSG and uploading instructions into the twiki when completed.

---++Scope
The OSG Project Workflow Procedure is a way to assist the OSG Executive Board with beginning, creating, maintaining, and completing projects as they arise.

---++Project Requests Made
The OSG Executive Director, Ruth Pordes will request a project to be assisted by the OSG Adminstrative Staff.  At which time it will be discussed what the project will entail, research needed and work that needs to be completed.

---++Creating a Project Log
Once a project is requested we keep track of the OSG projects by maintaining an excel spreadsheet that keeps a log of the following details needed:
   1.Project name
   1.Priority Status
   1.Maintenance Status (Ex. New, Operation) 
   1.Requestor
   1.Owner
   1.Effort
   1.Start Date
   1.End Date
   1.Location of the file or url
   1.Details
   1.Documentation Status
   1.Comments/Notes

The administrator will maintain by adding, removing, updating the log as projects are added, changed, and removed.

---++Completion of an OSG Project
For project completion it is to be documented in the how to's located on the twiki under Administrative Procedures: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/AdministrativeProcedures.  For further instructions on how to add completed projects to the twiki please see:
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/ProceduralDocumentation.
