---++ Software, by Brian Lin

Since May 24, 2017.

---+++ Software updates
Development for June, July, and August releases:
   * Updated to HTCondor 8.4.12, 8.6.5, 8.7.2
   * Updated to HTCondor-CE 3.0.1 and 2.2.2
   * VOMS Admin server updates to address struts2 vulnerabilities
   * osg-configure and osg-build changes to support OSG 3.4
   * Improved BLAHP support for PBS Pro
   * gridftp-dsi-posix for ATLAS
   * LCMAPS VOMS plugin bug fixes
   * Removed repo.grid.iu.edu references from osg-ca-scripts

---+++ OSG 3.4
   * Released 3.4.0 in the June release with plenty of testing effort from CMS and ATLAS
   * Wrote and distributed !BeStMan, GUMS, and VOMS Admin retirement policies
   * Remaining tasks: Singularity and new release series documentation

---+++ HTCondor-CE and Friends
   * Added pilot payload auditing - depends on HTCondor 8.6.x so we are maintaining two different versions for 3.3 and 3.4
   * Ongoing support for CTSC for the security review of HTCondor-CE and the BLAHP
   * Concern: blahp unification has been in a holding pattern 

---+++ LCMAPS VOMS plugin
   * The recommended OSG authentication method moving forward
   * Required separation of osg-configure modules to allow auth configuration for !GridFTP hosts
   * Transitioned all of the hosted CEs and some edg-mkgridmap/GUMS sites
   * Notified other edg-mkgridmap sites of the need to transition
   * Completed installation and edg-mkgridmap transition instructions

---+++ Documentation Transition
   * Initial set of documents (~130) prioritized for the migration
   * Migration instructions available for team members (and external contributors) with the goal of each team member converting 2 documents per week

---+++ Automated Testing
   * Caught HTCondor and GUMS SELinux incompatibilities in Red Hat 7.4
   * Added LCMAPS VOMS plugin, GSI OpenSSH, and gfal tests
   * Cleaned out BDII, osg-info-services, lcg-utils, and lfc_multilib tests. GRAM tests targeted next.

---+++ Madison ITB
Infrastructure prepared to test pre-release versions of HTCondor while maintaining a set of hosts running a stable version of HTCondor

---+++ Support
The Software team typically handles 1-2 active site support issues every week, in additional to other random GOC tickets that come our way. Since the last report, we have helped:
   * Clemson - Issues with PBS Pro/blahp integration and LCMAPS proxy verification
   * CTSC/IU - Ongoing HTCondor-CE and blahp installation and configuration
   * FIT - Transitioned from GRAM to HTCondor-CE
   * Nebraska - Debugged missing hours in WLCG
   * IIT - Discovered bug with LCMAPS proxy verification
   * Purdue - Helped with OSG_WN_TMP configuration
   * Syracuse - Implemented GPU submission on their CE
   * TAMU - Troubleshot held jobs
   * UConn - Discovered various authentication issues, ongoing
   * UCSD - Assisted with GPU job router configuration
   * UFL - Assisted with Slurm timeout issues
   * Utah - Discovered bug in proxy delegation
   * UWash - Helped troubleshoot held jobs
   * UW Madison - Assisted with RHEL6 vs RHEL7 job router configuration
   * Vanderbilt - HTCondor-CE + Slurm issues
