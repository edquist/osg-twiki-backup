---+++ Calendar

---+++ Research highlight updates
None.

---+++ Security projects
   * CVMFS master key: The deployment of Yubikeys is complete.
   * Refactoring the process for creating CA certificate bundles is in progress and almost done.

   * Updating the Grid Admin forms to remove Digicert references is in progress.
   * Tracking Singularity jobs via a Python plug-in is in progress and being tested.
   * Susan is working on Year 6 goals for the Security Team.

---+++ Security vulnerabilities
   * EGI reported a high-severity problem with Qemu and Xen, but it likely has no effect on OSG, so there was no OSG announcement.
   * Jim Basney identified a problem with some OSG certificates, which were intended to be service certificates, but were requested and approved as user certificates by accident; the Security Team has updated the request forms and training materials to try to avoid such mistakes in the future.
   * There was an announcement about the Stack Clash vulnerability.
   * The team updated the announcement about VOMS Admin package update.

---+++ Review of Security Team goals
   * Most Year 5 items are complete.
   * Still working on an evaluation of SWAMP for OSG Software, but currently it does not seem very helpful.
   * The CVMFS master key work is a precursor to automating the generation of host certificates.

---+++ Concerns
None.

---+++ Action items
