Key Initiatives
   1. HPC: CMS still has authentication issues. Continue opportunistic use of Comet. Fermilab ready to test Stampede for Minos.
   2. GPU: Added Tusker (HCC) via dedicated factory entry, used by IceCube and OSG VOs; Fermilab VO about to start testing.
   3. FIFE: uboone is now using EGI sites; DES-GW running outside of FNAL (level of 110 jobs / 440 cores); resuming integration of OSC for NOvA.
   4. NOvA testing StashCache over CVMFS at FZU; other OSG sites still have a version of CVMFS too old to be usable.
   5. GRACC project approximately on schedule. Record processing pipeline functional: Gratia records replicated to GRACC; back populated records from early 2015. Basic Grafana dashboards and system monitoring implemented. Elasticsearch development system deployed at UNL: exploring stability and performance issues. Good agreement between Gratia and GRACC data.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Still need to clarify model for integrating HPC, given the small pool of use cases explored

Key Accomplishments
   1. 58M h from past quarter, from 67M h previous quarter - "volume" of OSG sites steady at 23M h / week.
   2. 3 out of 5 top opportunistic sites are now non-LHC (SU, HCC, Clemson), with largest contributions from SU.
