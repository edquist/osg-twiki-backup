Key Initiatives
   1. Effective service delivery for XSEDE Users - doing well
   2. On-boarding new researchers contacting OSG - doing well, need more customers. What do we need to change to increase researchers by e.g. 50%?
   3. Integration of Galaxy to OSG, focusing on IU support for data handling (NEW initiative)
   4. Review Intensity Frontier data handling plan and provide input on how to leverage OSG initiatives (NEW)
   5. Grow opportunistic pool of resources for the OSG VO (NEW)

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. How do we identify more researchers?
   2. How do we get more opportunistic cycles?
   3. OSG VO contributes non trivial effort to support customers. We require better monitoring of GlideinWMS.
   4. We need a plan for site support that better integrates available effort (site support + gFactory)

Key Accomplishments
   1. 80M opportunistic hours on OSG in the last 12 months (OSG, Glow, Engage, HCC, SBGrid)
   2. Supported 12 projects / PIs directly in OSG in 2013 for 20 M hours. Supported 21 projects / 19 PIs via OSG-XD for 21M hours.
   3. Support for new site integration transitioned from Marco Mambelli (who left OSG) to Marko Slyz at 0.1 FTE. Need more coordinated plan.
   4. Upgraded OSG-CD Front end. Handles 20K active jobs + more flocking connections. Improved load balancing.
   5. Planning to transition OSG Public storage service (iRODS) to GOC.
