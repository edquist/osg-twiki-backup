---++ Security - Mine Altunay
   * Last report was on April 1st. Key initiative was to apply for our accreditation at the May 27 TAGPMA meeting. 
   * Key initiatives:
   * OSG CA project: 
      * IGTF accreditation. I think many you already heard that our presentation went really well. there was no objections or contentious issues. One of the attendees even called our case "straightforward" so I expect no problems with our accreditation. We were assigned 2 reviewers, Dave Kelsey and Irwin Gaines. I am working with them to get our CP/CPS and operational review as soon as possible. My target is to complete the review by the end of the summer. 
      * Testing phase. We completed the OSG stack tests in ITB. Many thanks to Horst, Suchandra, Xin, Garhan and Brian. No major problems found. A few issues were noted and fixed immediately. You can find them at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CATestProcedure. 
         * OSG Services is the biggest item remaining now. I understand Alain is working on this now. GOC promised to finish this by the end of this week.
