---++ Software Report

I last reported on the state of OSG software at the [[200900416ETAgendaMinutes][April 16th, 2009]] area coordinator meeting.

---+++ Major Changes
Since the last meeting, we have:

   * Released VDT 1.11.0, a pre-release for VDT 2.0.0 with support for Debian 5, requested by LIGO
   * Released VDT 2.0.0, which will be the basis for OSG 1.2. [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release.html][VDT 2.0.0 release notes]]
   * Released two minor updates to VDT 2.0.0. [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p1.html][VDT 2.0.0p1 release notes]] [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p2.html][VDT 2.0.0p2 release notes]]
   * Worked with the VTB to validate VDT 2.0.0. This work culiminated in VDT 2.0.0p2. 
   * Prepped for, and began ITB testing. This just started on June 9, 2009 so there hasn't yet been significant feedback. 
   * Installed a new test stand at Fermilab to test Bestman-gateway with Xrootd and Hadoop, as well as Bestman by itself. 
   * Created a web site that contains all certification test results for BeStMan and dCache as well as monitoring tools output (ganglia, srmwatch, etc)
   * Released new vdt-dCache version 2.3.1 (dcache -1.9.2-5, new pnfs, gratia probes 1.02.1-5)
   * Tested new SRM Fermi client (included in VDT 1.10.1 and 2.0.0 now).
   * Provided feedback on Hadoop installation documentation

---+++ Interesting changes in VDT 2.0.0
A few particularly interesting things happened in VDT 2.0.0:

   * We added clients for four network diagnostic tools requested by ATLAS. They are NPAD, NDT, OWAMP, and BWCTL. They will be widely deployed in OSG 1.2 so that site administrators have access to them when diagnosing network problems. This fulfills the work for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/AllRequirements][Requirement 5 on the Software Tools Group requirements list]].
   * We've improved MyProxy support, requested by ATLAS. MyProxy is now linked against VOMS, has been upgraded to version 4.7, and has proper configuration within the VDT (previously we just laid down the bits with no configuration), and has been separated into client and server packages for better control over what is installed. This fulfills the work for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/AllRequirements][Requirement 36 on the Software Tools Group requirements list]].
   * We have released an update to glexec to address a serious security problem. [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/advisories/glexec-0.5.36.html][Text of the VDT glexec security advisory]].
   * We have begun a major project to provide source Debian packages and RPMs. Initially we are focused on LIGO's short-term needs, but this will lead to better support for native packages for the VDT. 

---+++ Upcoming work
During the summer of 2009, I expect we'll focus primarily on:

   * The release of OSG 1.2. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/OSG12Plan][The OSG 1.2 Plan]] In particular, we plan to freeze changes to the VDT and OSG caches in the middle of ITB testing, on July 1. We plan to release OSG 1.2 at the end of July so that it's ready to go for the site administrator meeting at the beginning of August and can be installed before the LHC restart.
   * Source packages for Debian and RPM.
   * Organizing the OSG Storage Forum at Fermilab (June 30 & July 1)
   * Participating in US LCG Tier-3 Liason Group. Goal of the group to advise Tier-3 on storage selection/configuration
   * Understanding/testing Hadoop.
   * Improving d-cache installation script. The dCache-vdt release will include community toolkit rpms.
   * Discussing xrootd monitoring package installation with developers
