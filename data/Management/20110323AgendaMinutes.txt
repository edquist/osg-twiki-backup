---++ 1.1 Software

---+++ What is running significantly late and thus needs attention

1.1.4.2.2: [After CREAM] Add GRAM 5 to software stack<br>
This was scheduled for March, but CREAM is running late so it's way behind. Should we still leave it for "After CREAM" or should we re-evaluate?

1.1.4.4.1: Define contents of submit host (with Fraser)<br>
This was scheduled for early January, and it's been completely neglected. I haven't felt the pressure to do it. Should I ratchet up the pressure, or should we change the time line?

1.1.4.5.1: Define contents of Operations Center software with GOC<br>
This was scheduled for early January, and it's been completely neglected. I haven't felt the pressure to do it. Should I ratchet up the pressure, or should we change the time line?

1.1.4.12: SHA-1 transition<br>
This was scheduled for early January though May, and it's been completely neglected. I haven't felt the pressure to do it. Should I ratchet up the pressure, or should we change the time line? Input from Mine would be particularly valuable for this item.

---+++ What WBS items have been completed

1.1.6.1: Complete glexec packaging (100% done)
1.1.6.2: Complete worker node packaging (nearly done, in testing)

We have a major milestone towards our native packaging. It's late, but it's still good news. We are ready to begin testing outside the VDT team of our worker node client, including glexec. 

---+++ What WBS items need to be added/removed and why

1.1.4.1.2: Report to ET on effort to add CREAM; expand WBS based on feedback<br>
We have a plan for CREAM, but we have not finalized it yet. I need to work with Chander and Dan to finalize the plan, then expand the WBS. This needs to happen ASAP.

1.1.5: Public (Opportunistic) Storage<br>
Tanya and Alain don't have the same understanding of where we should be proceeding with public storage, and we'd like to request a meeting with Ruth and Chander to resolve it. In any case, we don't believe the WBS reflects what we are doing with public storage. 

Work for LIGO's native packaging is not noted anywhere in the WBS--I believe it should be. 

---+++ Other concerns

1.1.2.4: Participate in WLCG Technical group, report to ET as appropriate<br>
Management should know that this group has not been active in several months, so we have not been participating. 

If you know of anyone we should invite to the OSG Summer School, or anywhere that we should be advertising, please raise your hand now. We have two weeks left for people to apply to the school. We need your help to get out the word.
