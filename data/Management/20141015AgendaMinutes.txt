      * Instructions and current inventory, documentation: https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/display/CON/Distributed+Environment+Modules
   * More development on "tutorial" command
      * tutorial modules maintained in github and connect-book
      * Available on login.osgconnect.net:<pre>$ tutorial

   * Connect client development
      * Goal is to give campus grids a client tool:
         * Pre-installed, configured, and supported by local campus cluster admin
         * Submission to OSG via grid universe
         * Submission to local scheduler via vanilla universe, using local campus allocation
         * "connect" and "tutorial" commands
         * modules command: allow switching between local modules collection and OASIS modules
   * Software Carpentry + OSG Campus Bootcamp
      * Working with User Support and Lauren Michael to hold co-branded training event January 15-16, 2015 (Madison)
      * Targeted for new users to scientific computing: go from an intro to the Unix command line to running jobs on OSG in 2.5 days.
      * Preliminary syllabus: http://dmbala.github.io/2014-09-29-UC-Test/ 
   * Working with Syracuse (Orange Grid), expanded discussion to include local LIGO group.  Signed them up to evaluate OSG Connect.


---+++ Top Issues/Concerns
   * Preparing for SWC-OSG bootcamp
   * Organizing tutorial modules for re-use, e.g. ACI-REF webinars


---+++ Key Accomplishments
   * Distributed modules in production with OASIS, actively adding new modules.  System in place to track usage statistics, will provide public interface.
