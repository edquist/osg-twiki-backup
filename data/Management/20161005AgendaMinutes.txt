---++  Rob Gardner - User Support Campus Grids

   * Overview
      * OSG-XD, -Direct, -Connect systems heavily used and operating with good efficiency
         * Significant change is adding quota system to /home server on -Connect and training users to utilize local scratch and stash for larger datasets 
      * In good shape w.r.t. target metrics (active users, CPU-hours)
         * An exception is the connect-client which hasn't been a success (yet at least)
      * Emelie now back from maternity leave

   * !FreeSurfer:
      * V2 is available in beta testing (provides user options for "custom" transformations)
      * Documentation re-worked, under review: http://bit.ly/freesurferopensciencegrid
      

   * !Xenon1T:
      * Deployed !Xenon1T OASIS stratum 1 server to allow automated deploy (their favorite tool is !DeployHQ). *done*
      * Working to get the transfer tools (gfal2) compatible with their python.  *done*
      * Helping get LNGS into LHCONE (*in progress*)

         * Working with Stockholm post doc to integrate with Xenon production system
