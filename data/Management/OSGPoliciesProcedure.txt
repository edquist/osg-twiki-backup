---+!! OSG Policies
%TOC%

The OSG Policies page gathers and categorizes all relevant policies for OSG.  The page uses the OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]] in order to organize and gather the current policies.  

---++Scope
To provide OSG Users and Members with a consolidated place to view relevant policies and procedures for OSG.

----++Categorization
The policies page currently has 5 categorizations:
   * *Users and Service Providers* - Policies and procedures that govern members and their information, including service agreements, acceptable use and privacy. 
   * *Security* - Policies and procedures that determine security protocol for OSG
   * *VOs* - Policies and procedure for general VOs, including registration
   * *Governance and Council* - Policies and procedures for that regulate existing council and governance
   * *OSG-VO* - Policies and procedures that govern members of the OSG-VO

Each of those categorizations is listed in [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]] as a Policy keyword.  

---++Updating List
Although the list will automatically update itself based on those procedures and policies available in DocDB, there should be a regular check to maintain that the relevant policies and procedures have been properly labeled in DocDB.
