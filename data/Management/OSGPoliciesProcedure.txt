---+!! OSG Policies
%TOC%

The OSG Policies page gathers and categorizes all relevant policies for OSG.  The page uses the OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]] in order to organize and gather the current policies.  

---++Scope
To provide OSG Users and Members with a consolidated place to view relevant policies and procedures for OSG.

----++Categorization
The policies page currently has 5 categorizations:
   * *Users and Service Providers* - Policies and procedures that govern members and their information, including service agreements, acceptable use and privacy. 
   * *Security* - Policies and procedures that determine security protocol for OSG
   * *VOs* - Policies and procedure for general VOs, including registration
   * *Governance and Council* - Policies and procedures for that regulate existing council and governance
   * *OSG-VO* - Policies and procedures that govern members of the OSG-VO

Each of those categorizations is listed in [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]] under the following policy keywords:
   * *Users and Service Providers* = Users
   * *Security* = securitypolicies
   * *VOs* = VOs
   * *Governance and Council* = Governance
   * *OSG-VO* = OSG-VO

   1. The keywords must be entered exactly as written or selected from the available list when updating or creating a new document in DocDB.  
   1. When making a new keyword, make sure it is a *unique* word (not words) so that the query does not pick up other irrelevant documents.


---++Updating List
Although the list will automatically update itself based on those procedures and policies available in DocDB, there should be a regular check to maintain that the relevant policies and procedures have been properly labeled in DocDB.

   * Check with the Executive Director if the current policies page is up to date
   * Scan the first page of [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org][OSG Doc DB]] to see whether new documents have been added.
   * If the document is a policy, check that it is categorized properly by keyword
   * Also check for stray documents that have been accidentally placed within a policy keyword.  
   * Add or update a document using the following guide: [[UpdatingorAddingaDocumentonDocDB][Updating or Adding a Document on DocDB]]
<BR>
There are three places to regularly check for updated or new policies:
   * OSG DocDB Topic: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ListBy?topicid=39][Policies]]
   * OSG DocDB Topic: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ListBy?topicid=44][Security Policies]]
   * OSG Twiki security topic [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/PoliciesProcedures][Policies and Procedures]]
   * Any other relevant area determined by the Executive Director
