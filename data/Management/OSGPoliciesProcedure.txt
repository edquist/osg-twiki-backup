---+!! OSG Policies
%TOC%

The OSG Policies page gathers and categorizes all relevant policies for OSG.  The page uses the OSG [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]] in order to organize and gather the current policies.  

---++Scope
To provide OSG Users and Members with a consolidated place to view relevant policies and procedures for OSG.

----++Categorization
The policies page currently has 5 categorizations:
   * *Users and Service Providers* - Policies and procedures that govern members and their information, including service agreements, acceptable use and privacy. 
   * *Security* - Policies and procedures that determine security protocol for OSG
   * *VOs* - Policies and procedure for general VOs, including registration
   * *Governance and Council* - Policies and procedures for that regulate existing council and governance
   * *OSG-VO* - Policies and procedures that govern members of the OSG-VO

Each of those categorizations is listed in [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][DocDB]] under the following policy keywords:
   * *Users and Service Providers* = Users
   * *Security* = securitypolicies
   * *VOs* = VOs
   * *Governance and Council* = Governance
   * *OSG-VO* = OSG-VO

   1. The keywords must be entered exactly as written or selected from the available list when updating or creating a new document in DocDB.  
   1. When making a new keyword, make sure it is a *unique* word (not words) so that the query does not pick up other irrelevant documents.


---++Updating List
Although the list will automatically update itself based on those procedures and policies available in DocDB, there should be a regular check to maintain that the relevant policies and procedures have been properly labeled in DocDB.

   * Check with the Executive Director if the current policies page is up to date
   * Scan the first page of [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org][OSG Doc DB]] to see whether new documents have been added.
   * If the document is a policy, check that it is categorized properly by keyword
   * Also check for stray documents that have been accidentally placed within a policy keyword.  
   * Add or update a document using the following guide: [[UpdatingorAddingaDocumentonDocDB][Updating or Adding a Document on DocDB]]
   * When a policy is secure (meaning you need a certificate to view it in DocDB) please create an additional DocDB entry that is public and displays the link to the secure document in the abstract. Follow this link for an example of this: http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=877&version=0 Use the procedure for adding a document from a link to create the public instance. 
<BR>
There are three places to regularly check for updated or new policies:
   * OSG DocDB Topic: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ListBy?topicid=39][Policies]]
   * OSG DocDB Topic: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ListBy?topicid=44][Security Policies]]
   * OSG Twiki security topic [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/PoliciesProcedures][Policies and Procedures]]
   * Any other relevant area determined by the Executive Director
