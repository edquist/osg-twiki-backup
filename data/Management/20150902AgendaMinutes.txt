Not Updated below this line. 

   4. Accounting
      * Upgrading to Multicore accounting has been a struggle. 
      * Mostly due to the moving target nature of the project.
         * First Update - Sent multicore information as separate record to APEL. 
         * Second Update - Updated multicore reporting from SSMv1 to SSMv2
         * Third Update - Combined reporting due to SSM upgrade and APEL's inability to process separate records, first test rendered Gratia unusable and queries were evicted
         * Forth Update - Brought in FNAL DB to find proper queries on summary data rather than main DB, numbers 20-30x too high.
         * Finally brought in Software team to help, making progress but still undone. 
   5. OASIS V2
      * Significant progress made
         * All components moved to production
         * Some initial instability, but this has resided
   6. Long term projects and directions
      * Reduce the hardware owned and administered by OSG Operations
         * Depend on OSG organizational institutions cloud type services
         * Never get to 100%, but should get as close as possible
      * Update service environment to a more standard configuration management system
         * Will happen over time
         * OASIS is the first target to ease burden on developers
      * OSG Environment Discovery
         * Based on job activity not registration
   7. Software Carpentry Workshop
      * Completed
      * Low attendance due to timing issues with mid-terms
      * Some good ongoing contacts obtained
   8. High Throughput Computing Challenge (A DHTC Scavenger Hunt) for AHM 2015
      * Learned a few more things, plan to continue this based on 2016 AHM planning committee recommendation
   9. Added ITB instance for !XRootD redirector
   10. I was named to the Planning Committee for [[http://htcaas.kisti.re.kr/wiki/index.php/AMGCC15][AMGCC]] - Autonomic Management of high performance Grid and Cloud Computing

---+++ Concerns and Issues

   1. Staffing changes
      * Soichi now 50%
      * Bill Barnett leaving as IU PI in July
      * I will take on interim management duties of the ABITC group during July
   2. Service Additions Adding Up
      * We've moved from "Currently sustainable but there are limits" - Worried about effort going forward.

   3. Resources are aging and becoming insufficient
      * Recent PerfSONAR additions have brought us to our current resource limit
      * Expect some new PerfSONAR hardware to be ordered shortly, but this will not solve all issues
   4. !PerfSONAR
      * Waiting for Validation Scripts
      * Purge Corruption Issue still needs follow up
   5. OSG Connect
