Key Initiatives
   1. Traceability for end-user jobs without certificates: demonstrated capability to track malicious jobs, with certain limitations. Requesting software changes to glideinWMS and HTCondor to address them. Presenting findings to the Fermilab security board; expect turn around of ~ 1 month.
   2. OASIS / CVMFS security assessment: Fermilab accepted risk assessment and to provide a stratum-1. Coordinating with production area.
   3. CILogon Basic CA adoption - U of Wisconsin provides a test system to issue certificates for the Glow VO members; Fermilab has agreed to accept these credentials.
   4. Operational security activities. SHA-2 due date delayed from Aug to Oct to accommodate EGI requests. OSG is planning to respect to the original Aug deadline.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Organizing temporary transition of leadership in the security area to Kevin Hill to cover Mine's maternity leave.
   2. Extending CILogon adoption: Uncertainties on the schedule to move the CILogon infrastructure at University of Wisconsin to production. This may delay plans to involve more sites to use CILogon similarly to University of Wisconsin (possibly CSIU and UC3).

Key Accomplishments
   1. Run security drill for traceability of end-user jobs without certificates with Nebraska and the UCSD factory.
   2. Run security-related meetings with 3 new OSG VO. Expect 2 more.
