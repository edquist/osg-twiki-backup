---++ Software Report - Alain Roy

Last report to the Area Coordinator Meeting [[20120229AgendaMinutes][February 29, 2012]]

---+++ Status & Accomplishments

Highlights since the last report:

   * OSG Software 3.1 was released: SL6, GUMS, Gratia, and more!
   * GOC Training
   * OSG test fest

We have made three software releases since the last meeting.

   1. OSG 3.0.9: Bug fixes for Globus, Gratia, osg-configure, and OSG Cleanup
   1. OSG 3.0.10: CA certs & GRAM fix
   1. OSG 3.1.0: SL6, GUMS, Gratia, lcmaps, bugfixes

We know of 22 Compute Elements using the new OSG Software 3.0 release. 

---+++ Areas of Focus

These are the same areas that I reported on last time, except that I added focuses on testing and OSG User School .

*1. Support for sites and VOs as they deploy the new OSG Software 3 release:* <br>
Our support load has increased somewhat. We had some serious problems with VOMS at Fermilab, but have gotten good help from the VOMS developer and they are being resolved.

*2. Transitioning software to RPMs that is missing:* <br>
We're done! As of OSG 3.1.0 (released yesterday), everything that was in OSG 1.2 has now been packaged as RPMs. This release added the last two components: GUMS and the Gratia service. 

The OSG Evaluation Group at UCSD done quite a bit of testing with GUMS and it appears to scale as well as the version in OSG 1.2. We're comfortable with it going to production.

*3. Scientific Linux 6 support:* <br>
We're done! As of OSG 3.1.0 (released yesterday), the entire OSG 3.0 software stack is available on SL6 with the exception of the Gratia service. However, that is only a minor technical problem, and it will be released on SL6 shortly. 

*4. SHA-2 transition*: <br>
No update, and this is my fault. I'll report more soon

*5. Improving Support*: <br>
Our support system is in place and working well.

Last week, I visited the GOC and spent a day training the staff in the basics of the OSG 3.0 Software Stack with an emphasis on things they can do to handle easier tickets or take the initial steps on other software tickets. [[Operations.VDTSoftwareTraining][agenda and presentations]].

A large part of the preparation for this training was the development of new troubleshooting documents, particularly for Gratia and the information system, but also an expansion of existing troubleshooting documents. These are really important because they will allow the software team, the operations team, and users to handle many problems. 

New troubleshooting documents:
   * [[Documentation.Release3.TroubleshootingGratia][Troubleshooting Gratia]]
   * [[Documentation.Release3.TroubleShootingCEMonGIP][Troubleshooting Information Services (CEMon & GIP)]]
   * [[Documentation.Release3.TroubleshootingOsgConfigure][Troubleshooting osg-configure]] (not yet fleshed out)

*6. Improving effort tracking:* <br>
In the last two weeks, I've been coordinating with the Condor team, since we want to implement a compatible scheme for effort tracking. At the moment, we are settling the tool that we will be using. We hope to implement this on the team soon: within two to three weeks. 

*7. Testing:* <br>
I am working to improve our internal testing. This is important for ensuring that we have high quality software releases. We've done a few things towards this goal. 

   * A few weeks ago, we had a "test fest" to get team members up to speed on how to write tests for our test framework. This was very successful: we added quite a few tests, and more importantly, more people now understand how to write tests.
   * John Hover has volunteered to write tests for GUMS.
   * We've expanded our test coverage to include more OS varieties. I've learned more about testing OS pre-releases, and we'll be doing those soon too. This is very important, so that we catch problems coming "down the pipe" before our users do.
   * We've deployed new reporting systems for test results. While simplistic, we now have reasonable email and web interfaces. 

*8. OSG User School:* <br>
The OSG User School (formerly the OSG Summer School) planning is well underway. Tim Cartwright is leading the effort. Students have been accepted and travel logistics will be sorted out soon. There is an outline of the curriculum and Tim will be fleshing it out (with instructors) next.
