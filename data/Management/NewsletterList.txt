---++ Research Highlights to look into:

   * Ken Herner - DES
   * Steve Groom - IPAC discoveries - NASA…exoplanets, etc….
   * Jayant Prasad - Gravitational Waves & LIGO (India)
   * Benedikt Riedel - South Pole Telescope
   * Bryan Bales - JPL
   * Colin Smith - OpenSim knee biomechanics

   * Followup on AMS - starting to state what they’re using OSG for, but not in writing.  They seem to think they found anti helium and they’re doing lots of MC testing on OSG.
