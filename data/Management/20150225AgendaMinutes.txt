---++ Tim Cartwright - Software

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 3 December 2014:

   * *HTCondor CE.* Continued to make many small- to medium-sized enhancements and fixes; added the CE Collector and the !ClassAd attributes that are reported up to it
   * *RSV perfSONAR probe.* Completed a 1.0.0 release, and continued to make many changes leading toward a stable and performant production version
   * *EL 7.* Completed most remaining builds, except for the Java packages with complex dependency trees and Maven builds
   * *IPv6 evaluation.* Completed !XRootD evaluation, reviewed and settled on methodology, began testing in earnest
   * *Globus Toolkit 6.* Updated all Globus Toolkit packages to latest EPEL versions, fixed a few minor issues (including one bug fix, sent upstream), and completed developer testing; scheduled for release in March
   * *Software updates.* Handled a few urgent updates that were forced by dropped SSL support, changes to EPEL packages, and bugs in HTCondor; plus routine updates (Frontier Squid, VOMS)
   * *Scalability.* Complete initial round of HTCondor&nbsp;CE testing, hitting 18K concurrent running jobs on a single CE
   * *GUMS.* Continued to make small enhancements, fix bugs, and investigate issues
   * *OSG 3.3.* Started design &ndash; drop EL 5, add EL 7, add HTCondor 8.4 (once available), drop stale software; still more to plan
   * *Infrastructure.* Upgraded OS on the UW–Madison Koji build host
   * *Documentation.* Completed review and initial triage of all Release3 area documents; continued honing HTCondor&nbsp;CE documentation based on feedback from site administrators


---+++ Key Initiatives

*HTCondor CE*
   * Winding down, but there continues to be a very long tail of steady work
   * Still need a solid conceptual overview document
   * Still need ATLAS installs and any associated tweaks
   * Still need LSF and SGE installs and any associated tweaks; now have OU and Colorado working actively
   * Will deliver a training session on Thursday morning of the OSG All-Hands Meeting

*StashCache*
   * New high-profile project for OSG
   * The Software team has some significant development tasks to complete
      * Create a shim so that HTCondor can control !XRootD
      * Add reporting of !XRootD attributes back to the central CE Collector
      * Modify the CE Collector configuration to accept updates from all CEs
   * Likely will be involved in packaging updates (as needed), integration, testing, etc.
   * Plus whatever long tail falls on us

*OSG 3.3 rollout*
   * We need to complete the design for major changes
      * May design better meta-packages to support a distinction between straightforward and more complex sites
   * We still need to create tools to (help) rebuild *all* packages, which we did not do for OSG 3.2 but will do this time
   * Aiming for April–June release of 3.3.0; April is rather optimistic at this point

*IPv6 evaluation*
   * Finally started! (8 months late?)

*RSV probe for job submission*
   * Finally started
   * Small-ish effort
   * Iterative design &ndash; see what is easy, possible, useful, etc., as we go


---+++ Concerns

*Backlog*
   * The backlog of useful work is still significant
   * We track progress and despite a few downward jumps, incoming ticket rate slightly exceeds completion rate
   * Some projects, including important ones like documentation and setting up our Madison ITB site, are wholly starved of effort

*Prototype vs. production*
   * Software team gets some software components (etc.) that are more prototype than production
   * Need to identify such components before or when they arrive
   * Need room to (a) declare initial releases and prototypes, betas, whatever, and (b) harden the prototype into production-grade software

*Documentation*
   * Started, not much progress
   * Limited staff who can contribute, at least in critical ways; !TimC very much starved of effort lately (and no signs of improvement)
