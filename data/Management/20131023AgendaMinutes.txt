      * XSEDE
         * OSG-XSEDE busier than ever, approached 300k hours in a single day last week. 
         * Provisioning Blueprint will address use of XSEDE resources by OSG VOs. 
   5. New Homepage will be put in place 8/13
      * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][Link]]

      * Campaign to get non-WLCG sites to adopt OSG network monitoring. 
   13. PKI Usability Survey
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PkiSurvey][Draft]] from Brainstorming session

---+++ Top Concerns and Issues
   1. OSG Connect and CIC Services
      * New documentation area, new registration area
      * No concrete definition of what Operation services are needed
   2. Support Load
      * Hiring in progress
   3. !PerfSONAR Datastore and Monitoring
      * OSG and WLCG? Delays in !PerfSONAR software. 
   4. OASIS - Software Bugs and New Version
      * Underlying CVMFS software has caused some issues. 
      * New version will need to keep current functionality long term. While running separate services (SSH and Grid Job based) might make sense in the shorter term, I'd like to see these converge into a single OASIS. 

---+++ WBS Progress 
   1. Field of Science OIM - see above
      * Release v1 8/13
   2. Other Services
      * OASIS - See above
      * OSG-XSEDE - See above
      * Cross OSG CE - Seems to be stalled
      * iRODS - ITB instance in place
      * OSG Connect - See above
   3. !ReSS and Pacman deprecation
      * Pacman done.
      * !ReSS 12/31/2013 as OSG service. May be retained as a FNAL provided service.
