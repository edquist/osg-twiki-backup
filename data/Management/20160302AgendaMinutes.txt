**We want to get an update on the area goals we had established at the staff retreat; these goals are available at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1217

   1 Operations
      1 A new version of Globus software will require that all certificates with Subject Alternative Names have all aliases listed -- the name in the DN will no longer be checked -- in order to conform with an RFC. 
         1 We verified that previous certs with SANs from Digicert-Grid (which were only manually requested) conformed to the RFC.
         1The OSG CA also conforms, and there is new functionality that SANs can be requested by command line.  The command line is getting updated to also support SANs that are in two different domains as long as there is at least one person who can approve for both domains.
      1 Sent out an announcement for a critical glibc vulnerability when looking up DNS names that return both IPv4 & IPv6 results.
      1 The feature from a new VOMS-admin to disable checking of the issuing CA (which we wanted so it wouldn't complain about the change to Digicert SHA-2 CA certs) was backported to the version distributed by OSG, and we sent an announcement asking VOMS administrators to use it.  (In fact the feature hadn't even yet been released upstream, Brian found it in a pending patch which meanwhile has gotten released).
   1 OSG CA
      1 13 VOs transitioned so far: CMS, ATLAS, Fermilab, CDF, OSG, Dune, Star, Gluex, IceCube, Snoplus, CSIU, MIS, OSGEdu.
      1 36 more VOs before the end of May, but most of the complicated ones are done so should be relatively less work per  VO
      1 vo-client package v64 is ready to be released on March 8 as part of OSG Software 3.3.10 /3.2.36 release
         contains updates to Distinguished Names of DOSAR, SBGrid and NYSGrid VOMS servers
      1 March 8 transition: DOSAR, SBGrid and ORNL are ready; fusiongrid, NYSGRID, ESGF, DES, and T2K have small issues being worked
      1 Full table at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CATransitionProcedure][CATransitionProcedure]]
      1 A meeting was held with Digicert about the transition
         1 Nothing more is needed financially
         1 Digicert will continue to issue CRLs for a year
         1 We'll still be able to revoke certificates for that year
   1 HEPcloud
      1 First draft of the risk assessment is completed and sent to Fermilab management.  Gaps have been identified.
      1 In the second round, we will ask the project team to mitigate the risks and revise the assessment.
   1 Paper for  Cyber and Information Security Research (CISR) conference 
      * Camera ready copy almost ready, due March 7
   1 OSG AHM
      1 Anand will give some security training
      1 Jeny will talk about the OSG CA transition
      1 I will talk about DCAFI
   1 Distributed Computing Access with Federated Identities (DCAFI)
      1 Fermilab project for generating short-lived X.509 certificates from the command using CILogon Basic CA and Identity Providers that Support the SAML Enhanced Client Profile (ECP)
      1 Much more user-friendly than ordinary year-long certificates because certificate management is transparent to users
      1 I wrote a tool called [[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/fermitools/wiki/cigetcert][cigetcert]] to do the work, it is feature-complete.  Includes support for password or Kerberos authentication.
      1 Longer-lived certificate gets automatically pushed at the same time to a MyProxy server for job certificate renewal.  Integration with Fermilab's jobsub job submission system underway.
      1 Planned to have everybody transitioned by September before existing Kerberos CA goes away.
    
---++ Dave Dykstra - Technology: OASIS

   1 I am working on an update to OASIS including 17 tickets, to be put into production end of March or April.  11 done, 6 to go.  I plan to have them done this week.
   1 These are the most significant changes:
      1 Upgrade oasis and oasis-repiica to cvmfs-server-2.2.X.  The oasis-replica update is needed in order to support osgstorage.org repositories, a new feature for auxiliary data storage from Brian in cvmfs-2.2.X client that integrates with StashCache.
      1 Add a configuration repository.  Shared configuration can be updated centrally.  Most important is to be able to centrally add to a "blacklist" for security emergencies.  Will include use of this with all cvmfs-2.2.X clients.
      1 Fix blanking/unblanking for security emergencies with cvmfs clients configured without the configuration repository.
      1 Remove dependency on problematic nas01 file server.  Currently it is used only for communicating changes between oasis-login and oasis, and that functionality will instead be moved to the shared filesystem now used for storage of repositories that's directly attached to the hypervisor of all the oasis* machines.
