---++ Work Planning & Tracking
The OSG Planning process includes a WBS with the high level tasks (deliverables and milestones). The WBS is maintained by the Project Manager and updated on a quarterly basis by the responsible person for each task area. 
Each Area Coordinator then maintains more detailed task and action lists and plans. These relate to the items in the WBS and are developed to a hierachy as appropriate. Area Coordinators work with the Project Manager to review their work  for consistency with the WBS.  The WBS is modified as needed to include any new work identified.
