---+++ Events
   1. BDII SLA becomes inoperative 31/Mar
   2. All-Hands Meeting Complete
   3. Series of constant tweets during AHM seemed to go over well and gained us some exposure.
   4. We have a set of 7 solid leads for research highlights from AHM.  There are likely more to be found.
   5. Alain Deximo currently on terminal leave, Chris Pipes on paternity leave, but also terminal.

---+++ Concerns
   * Need more Research Highlight subject matter (We have a start with AHM info, but need more)

---+++ Goals
   * Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.


---++ Operations, by Scott Teige

---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1. Front Line Support and Operational Services meet SLA definitions. (see 2)
      * [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]]
   2.  !PerfSonar reliability continues to be a concern
      * Service is now in "Development" status, SLA is formally inoperative, done in consultation with the ET
   3. GRNOC that provides service desk staffing and tools are negotiating a contract with Service Now
      * Specific dates remain unknown
      * Many possible affects for ticketing exchange and presentation
      * This is still several months away, but will take planning and coordination with our collaborators
         * EGI, WLCG, FNAL, BNL
      * An agreement with GRNOC providing 24x7 coverage is being negoiated. This may go away, the ET is aware of this. 
   4. Final move of legacy contents from software.grid.iu.edu
      * Alias to repo.grid.iu.edu operational, last CA distro was repo.grid only
      * repo-itb at RHEL6, production instances to RHEL6 28/Mar
   5. RHEL5 !EoL goals met: [[http://monitor.grid.iu.edu/kernel/kernel_overview_el5.html][Conversion status]]
      * JIRA conversion underway
   6. Gratia sustainable for life of the current grant
      * gratia-apel reporting interface needs to be written
   7. Campus Queue paper submitted to PEARC17 
      * Scott will present (NOLA, July 9-13)
   8. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond. 
      * Will implement CILogon 1.0, 2.0 is in year 1 of 3 year development.
      * Initial project plan and research at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycLx_AqAxbhEeSNklQq5RAg3TTsMVIuib7hiXFSGoH4/edit?usp=sharing][Google Doc]]
   9. No updates planned during the first cycle of March due to AHM. 
      * Some updates to internal services happened, minor configuration change to support !PerfSonar efforts
   10. FNAL operational Services moves
      * OSG voms at IU is operational and tested, will become active with new VO package and some DNS aliases
   11. Long term projects and directions
      * Reduce the hardware owned and administered by OSG Operations
         * Depend on OSG organizational institutions cloud type services
         * Never get to 100%, but should get as close as possible
         * We've been moving backwards with new !perfSONAR and new VM hosts added
      * Update service environment to a more standard configuration management system
         * Ansible based configuration management is in place
         * Oasis and Stash development teams have access to the machine that implements the new system
            * External collaborators, relatively easy to add others as appropriate
         * 26/July and subsequent releases are ansible based  
         * Service machines switched: condor collector, oasis, oasis-login, oasis-replica, oim, stash redirector, tx, web, voms, reports
            * jira, twiki complete or nearly complete
         * Internal machines switched: csiu, kvmhost, lvs, staff, wn; external, jump, crlsync added since last report
            * csiu has Lustre a capable kernel, xrootd origin server capability and has oasis mounted

---+++ Concerns and Issues
   1. Staffing changes
      * Marina assuming primary responsibility for services, oim, ticket
      * Alain Deximo has left
   2. IPv6
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Sandbox/OperationsServicesIPv6CompatibilityTable][TWiki Page]]
      * Not much activity for Ops
   3. BDII Deprecation
      * End of life [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2016/12/planned-retirement-of-osg-bdii.html][announcement]] sent 19/Dec
      * The current version has a hard deadline of March 2017 due to the RHEL 5 life cycle ending.
      * SLA inoperative 31/Mar, will continue to run but will not repair failures

---+++ Goals and Metrics Update (Year4)
   1. Many of these are behind due to staffing discussed above.
   2. Goal #5 - "Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort." - Additional hardware in place for production services providing a home for this work. I don't see having the effort for this until the next round of funding. 
   3. Goal #6 - "Continue to provide training on new technologies to equip support desk staff to troubleshoot issue as they are reported." - Working with UCSD !GlideIn Ops to provide access to logs and common problems documentation so Ops support can do more in depth and proactive troubleshooting of !GlideInWMS problems. Kyle and Rob G are talking about offloading user support tasks to the ops support desk. 
   4. Goal #7 - "Develop and share a set of metrics that provide a reasonable measure of responsiveness to stakeholder tickets." - See draft document at - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/QATicket


---++ Minutes

*Attendees:* Brian Lin, Ken Herner, Kyle Gross, Scott Teige, Tim Cartwright, Tim Theisen

---+++ Communications, by Kyle Gross
   * For BDII, there needs to be one last announcement. Then, there was discussion about making sure there is an actual end-of-life, not just end-of-support. To that end, Scott selected Tuesday, April 4th, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time to power off the BDII hosts. If this causes an uproar (which it should not), it may be possible to turn them back on briefly, but of course there are no guarantees that this would work.
   * Social media efforts during the AHM seemed to be useful. So perhaps for next time, we should ask for social media IDs at least from presenters to make sharing and highlighting easier.
   * There were many leads for Research Highlights articles from the AHM, but Kyle still wants more and will comb through the AHM schedule for further ideas.
   * Alain Deximo and Chris Pipes are leaving the OSG and are already out of the office.

---+++ Operations, by Scott Teige
   * Operations continue to go well, except for the central perfSONAR services which, after consultation with the Executive Team, have been dropped from a production SLA to development status.
   * There is very slow progress toward Service Now in the GRNOC, but the belief is that the change will happen someday.
   * The software.grid.iu.edu host is no longer supported, and Scott will set a date to try turning it off. All software and data updates are going to repo\*.grid.iu.edu hosts now as planned.
   * Many GOC hosts that were running EL&nbsp;5 have been migrated to something newer, and the overall migration project is on track. The JIRA host is being upgraded next.
   * Gratia is still sustainable, but the APEL reporting script needs to be rewritten (owned by Carl Edquist on the Software team).
   * Scott will present at the PEARC conference about campus queues.
   * Marina is still working on Single Sign On (SSO) and CILogon.
   * Some services are being moved from FNAL to the OSG GOC. VOMS is working at the GOC now, is being tested, and will be made the official service when some DNS aliases are established and a new edition of the VO client data is released.
   * The GOC has made good progress on implementing host configuration and maintenance tasks with Ansible (also used by the Software team and some sites).

---+++ Concerns (for both areas)
   * Staffing changes: Alain and Chris have left (essentially). Marina is taking on primary responsibility for some of the systems that they &ldquo;owned&rdquo;.
   * IPv6 remains a latent concern, but there has been no recent activity.
   * The BDII end-of-life is coming soon, but the plans and announcements have been in place for a long time. So the level of concern is more about the imminent EOL date and less about known issues.
   * The research highlights pipeline could always use more inputs.

---+++ Action items
   * [Tim C] Add PEARC to OSG calendar
   * [Tim C] Request lessons learned from all Area Coordinators
