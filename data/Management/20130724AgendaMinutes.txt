Key Initiatives
   1. Effective service delivery for the XSEDE Users of OSG continues reliably at ~100k hours/day. Submit host shows limits of performance; upgrading hardware as an initial measure. Number of active users is modest but expected to grow.
   2. Working with Gratia to clean up campus accounting and adding science field. Working with GOC to provide a science field (project name) registration service. Seeking endorsement of the consortium to (1) work with campuses to deploy accounting probes at all major submission portals and (2) ask communities to use the science field.
   3. Current focus on community includes Belle/PNNL, UMD-IGS, Snowmass, NOvA, FIFE (intensity frontier project at Fermilab)

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Progress on NOvA's use of OSG is slow. Discussing new timeline with the experiment.
   2. Need to clarify BOSCO accounting principles and integrate science field.
   3. Working on hardware upgrades before users see unreasonable level of degradation in job submission.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Positive feedback for the support of the Snowmass group.
   2. Several new XSEDE users enabled on OSG
   3. Support from Campus Grids in OSG Connect i.e. bulk submission to OSG from Campuses
