   * 2.1 Scalability, Reliability, Software Certification and Usability - Igor Sfiligoi
      * Condor/glideinWMS R&D and testing - Worked with Condor to raise the scalability of Condor.
         Measured 40k+ running jobs and 870 starts/terminates per minute on a single schedd and 
                          90k+ glideins handled by a single collector (tree).<br>
         Presented at
         [[http://117.103.105.177/MaKaC/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=170&sessionId=97&confId=3][CHEP]].
      * Testing CREAM client, e.g. Condor-G. Found several bugs in Condor-G that were since fixed; seems usable now.<br>
         Main problem now the unavailability of VOMS certificate files; working with VDT and GOC to get them in the standard OSG distribution.
      * Extended testing of Bestman2+HDFS.
      * Stress tested ITB BDII at GOC.
      * Some progress testing ARC. Found more problems, and FY2010 ended before I could get it properly running.
         Dropped the effort.
      * Presented the OSG Scalability work at 
        [[http://117.103.105.177/MaKaC/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=233&sessionId=65&confId=3][CHEP]].
      * Created WBS for FY2011.

   * 3.2 Communications - Ritchie 
      * Communicating to wide area audiences via print media.
        As part of Supercomputing 2010, we have prepared (physical) bookmarks 
        that highlight OSG activities. These will be handed out to those 
        visiting the Fermilab booth at SC2010 in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
        See the rendering of the [[http://supercomputing.fnal.gov/SC2010/images/Renderings2010/Renderings2010-10-26p4.pdf][SC2010 LHC Corner]] <br>
      * Communicating via multi-media
         In collaboration with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 
         the left wall shown in the above link will have presentations on  
         the theme of World Wide Collaboration and global analysis using 
         visualizations produced by Derek Weitzel, Graduate Research Assistant, 
         University of Nebraska Holland Computing Center supervised by 
         David R. Swanson, Director, Holland Computing Center, University of Nebraska-Lincoln
      * Communicating to External Communicators
          At the request of Ruth Pordes, Miriam Boone will be taking an 
          increased role in communicating with External Communicators. 
          She has restarted the mailing list and is considering, if attendence
          merits it, holding a meeting during SC2010 in the Fermilab booth.
      *  Produce iSGTW
         Production of iSGTW is continuing on a regular basis.  Work is underway to re-launch the
         publication under a new name with a number of new features.  This is planned to occur
         during early 2011.  Please stay tuned. 
      *  Production of OSG News - nothing to report
      *  Provide Education - nothing to report
      * Track Publications
        Work is proceding on a new way to track publications.  Briefly, the plan is to encourage 
        those authoring publications to submit the publications to the archive http://arXiv.org/ 
       Once that is done, libraries around the world can import the publications into their catalogs
        tagged with OSG and VO affiliation. From their, reports of publication lists, destined 
       for DOE and NSF, can be made in a much less labor-intensive fashion than has been
          done previouslsy.  We are currently doing a trial of the whole process to make sure
          the benefits hoped for will occur.
