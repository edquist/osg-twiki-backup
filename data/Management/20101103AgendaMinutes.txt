   * 2.1 Scalability, Reliability, Software Certification and Usability - Igor Sfiligoi
      * Condor/glideinWMS R&D and testing - Worked with Condor to raise the scalability of Condor.
         Measured 40k+ running jobs and 870 starts/terminates per minute on a single schedd and 
                          90k+ glideins handled by a single collector (tree).<br>
         Presented at
         [[http://117.103.105.177/MaKaC/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=170&sessionId=97&confId=3][CHEP]].
      * Testing CREAM client, e.g. Condor-G. Found several bugs in Condor-G that were since fixed; seems usable now.<br>
         Main problem now the unavailability of VOMS certificate files; working with VDT and GOC to get them in the standard OSG distribution.
      * Extended testing of Bestman2+HDFS.
      * Stress tested ITB BDII at GOC.
      * Some progress testing ARC. Found more problems, and FY2010 ended before I could get it properly running.
         Dropped the effort.
      * Presented the OSG Scalability work at 
        [[http://117.103.105.177/MaKaC/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=233&sessionId=65&confId=3][CHEP]].
      * Created WBS for FY2011.

   * 3.3 Proj Mgmt - Sehgal _(confirmed)_

   * 3.1 Metrics  - Bockelman & Gardner _(confirmed)_
