   * 2.1 Scalability, Reliability, Software Certification and Usability - Igor Sfiligoi
      * Condor/glideinWMS R&D and testing - Worked with Condor to raise the scalability of Condor.
         Measured 40k+ running jobs and 870 starts/terminates per minute on a single schedd and 
                          90k+ glideins handled by a single collector (tree).<br>
         Presented at
         [[http://117.103.105.177/MaKaC/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=170&sessionId=97&confId=3][CHEP]].
      * Testing CREAM client, e.g. Condor-G. Found several bugs in Condor-G that were since fixed; seems usable now.<br>
         Main problem now the unavailability of VOMS certificate files; working with VDT and GOC to get them in the standard OSG distribution.
      * Extended testing of Bestman2+HDFS.
      * Stress tested ITB BDII at GOC.
      * Some progress testing ARC. Found more problems, and FY2010 ended before I could get it properly running.
         Dropped the effort.
      * Presented the OSG Scalability work at 
        [[http://117.103.105.177/MaKaC/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=233&sessionId=65&confId=3][CHEP]].
      * Created WBS for FY2011.

   * 3.2 Communications - Ritchie 
      * Communicating to wide area audiences via print media.
        As part of Supercomputing 2010, we have prepared bookmarks that highlight OSG activities.  
        These will be handed out to those visiting the Fermilab booth at SC2010 in New Orleans, Louisianna.

      * Communicating via multi-media
         In collaboration with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the left wall shown in the above link will have presentations on  
          the theme of World Wide Collaboration and global analysis using visualizations produced by Derek Weitzel, Graduate Research Assistant, University of Nebraska Holland Computing Center 
          supervised by David R. Swanson, Director of the David R. Swanson, Director, Holland Computing Center, University of Nebraska-Lincoln
      * Communicating to External Communicators
          At the request of Ruth Pordes, Miriam Boone will be taking an increasing role in communicating with External Communicators. She has restarted the mailing list and is considering if attendence
          merits it holding a meeting during SC2010. 


  
   * 3.3 [[%ATTACHURL%/Proj_Mgmt_Area_Update_3Nov2010.pdf][Proj Mgmt Area Update 3Nov2010 - Chander Sehgal]]

   * 3.1 Metrics  - Bockelman & Gardner _(confirmed)_
