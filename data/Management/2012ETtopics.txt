---+++A preliminary list of notes, topics and decisions from OSG Executive Team Meetings

---++++ 2012-08

CA contingency/recovery plan
   * was presented to the Council and discussed there. 
   * following the ET discussion, we shall inform WLCG about the plan, in particular that WLCG will have to accept a non-IGTF CA as a backup in the event of CA failure. As far as we know, no other entity in WLCG has a contingency plan for a CA failure, so very likely there is no precedence. The OSG plan is driven by cost, and the option to accept a non-IGTF CA seems better than having no contingency plan
   * several possible additional contingency studies were considered, but the ET recommends to stick to the plan as defined and do no significant follow up work.
