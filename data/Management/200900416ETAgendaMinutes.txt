---++ Software Report

I last reported in January. Major things of note since then. 

---+++ VDT Releases

   * Enormous amount of work on VDT 1.10.1 update. Focused on:
      * New method for updating the VDT: significant, important
      * Updated Globus
      * Updated GUMS/PRIMA/glexec.
         * GUMS now has user banning
         * New protocol between PRIMA and GUMS
      * GIP 1.2 & new CEMon
      * New version of Bestman
      * Added OSG Matchmaker
      * [[Other miscellaneous updates][http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/release-bigupdate.html]]
   * This release is in final testing now. 
      * Getting the updater *right* has taken more work than expected
      * VTB/ITB testing was slower than expected.
   * Good progress on new VDT (1.11.0) focusing on:
      * Improved updatability
      * Debian 5 support for LIGO
   * VDT 1.11.0 is nearly done, mostly delayed by VDT 1.10.0 update.

---+++ OSG Storage

*Current Initiatives* 

   * Incorporating Info Provider tests into certification test suite
   * Installing BeStMan-gateway/xrootd, BeStMan-gateway and Bestman on BeStMan test stand at Fermilab  (20 VMs)
   * Working on performance test suite
   * Testing a new major release of dCache
   * Involved in ITB testing installation and upgrade procedure, documentation

*Issues/Concerns* 

   * Timely releases
   * Support/efforts


---+++ Engagement


   * Maxim: here's the list of people and organizations I have written letters to, on behalf of OSG Engagement: 
      * Vice President for research of Columbia U, 
      * Vice President for research of SUNY Stony Brook, 
      * Vice Chancellor for Research at CUNY, 
      * Provost for Research of NYU, 
      * BNL research groups:
      * two biology research groups 
      * one group at the Center for Functional Nanomaterials 
      * LSST computing 
      * Atmospheric research Division at BNL
      * Nonproliferation and National Security Division at BNL
   * From the top portion of the list, got one reply from NYU which was lukewarm and didn't result in further engagement.
   * From the bottom portion of the list, the Nonproliferation activity was a qualified success as the following was accomplished: 
      * I established the "embarrasingly parallel" task flow for the project (image analysis for material science)
      * tested necessary code adaptations (code written in IDL)
      * processed existing data for the experiment, using the IDL installation on Jacquard (NERSC) 
      * now awaiting further data and working on a generic data hosting solution to give the group web-based access to Panda (which is tied into Education plans as discussed in separate threads) 


   * Recent momentum at Duke: we will be at critical mass with users once the recent engagements start showing success (estimate one to two months); working to find a home for campus condor pool central services to seed a campus grid to tie into OSG.

   * Status of OSG Workshop at RENCI. Slightly different agenda than most grid schools: one day for users, one day for providers. We are trying to reach out to new users as well as central IT people at the three big universities in the area: UNC Chapel Hill, Duke, and NCSU. So far, 22 attendees have signed up.

   * UNC-CH campus grid has been green-lighted by UNC-ITS, so it is official now, and done in time for the OSG Workshop. In a perfect world, there will be sufficient activity on TarHeel Grid within a month or two that it will be worth of an iSGTW article.

   * We are beginning a move in a direction where we can use the technology base that we have developed over the years in our TeraGrid Science Gateway efforts for OSG Engagement activities. As a result, Mats is focusing more on development and integration efforts with this infrastructure for a while, and Chris Bizon and Michael Stealey will ramp up on the user engagements to free up Mats to do this work. Chris Bizon is looking into the feasibility of having Raptor (Jinbo Xu) as a trial run for this new job submission/mgmt interface. Submitted an abstract to TG09 conference related to this.

   * We are struggling with the best way to handle parallel activities at a campus for users submitting to: OSG and a budding local condor pool. Don’t want them to be two separate submission processes, don’t want to require DOE Certs for local campus condor pool. options include job router, higher level tools for submission (eg Swift), and more. Not clear yet where it is best to expend effort. This is making OSG harder to sell to campuses.
