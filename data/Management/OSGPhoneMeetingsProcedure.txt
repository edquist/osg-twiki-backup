To assist with setting up OSG phone meetings.

---++Scope
As requested the OSG Administrator staff will assist in coordinating and setting up phone meetings.

---++Arranging a Poll for Phone Meetings
To assist in coordinating a phone meeting for multiple parties for OSG we currently use a doodle poll for arranging a time and date.  The doodle poll is a free public service to assist with meeting coordination, if you are interested in using this service please visit: http://www.doodle.com/main.html and no account is necessary.   

---++Setting up Phone Meetings
Once a time and date has been agreed upon for all parties we currently use ESnet as a service for setting up all OSG phone meetings.  To register for an ESnet account please visit:  http://www.es.net/  ; once you register you will be able to set up a telecon by visiting ESnet, located under services, please click: Conferencing ESnet Collaboration Services (ECS).  Last you would select Audio & Data (T20) for creating, scheduling and finalizing the OSG phone meeting.
