To assist in coordinating all parties as requested if over the number of 3 for an agreed upon time and date for a phone conference for OSG we currently use a doodle poll.  The doodle poll is a free public service to assist with meeting coordination, if you are interested in using this service please visit: http://www.doodle.com/main.htmland ; no account is necessary.

Once a time and date has been agreed upon for all parties we currently use ESNET as a service for setting up all OSG phone meetings.  To register for an ESNET account please visit:  http://www.es.net/ ; once you register you will be able to set up a telecon by visiting ESNET, located under services, please click: Conferencing ESnet Collaboration Services (ECS).  Last you would select Audio & Data (T20) for finalizing the scheduled meeting.
