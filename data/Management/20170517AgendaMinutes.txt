---++ Communications, by Kyle Gross

---+++ Events
   1. Alain Deximo currently on terminal leave, Chris Pipes on paternity leave, but also terminal. May 31 is their final day of employment.
   2. PEARC17 has asked us to make a lot of announcements.  These will continue until July.
   3. Currently 3 Research Highlights in the pipeline.
   4. BDII shut down 4/Apr, no complaints
   5. Requests for adding accounting info to main OSG Website - deciding how to approach this. (display.grid... or gracc itself?)

---+++ Concerns
   * Need more Research Highlight subject matter (We have started with AHM info, but it's not always worked out)
   * Current change in effort within my Operations Support group has stressed effort levels. The adjustment period has greatly shifted my effort, though I am swinging back towards a more normal schedule. 
   * Lesser concern - Cleanup of FNAL mailing lists is tough. I've asked, but it is not always easy for me to become the admin any given mailing list. Though there is some progress. I will forge on.


---+++ Goals
   * Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.
   * Continue and expand Ansible (see below) integration into Operations.

---++ Operations, by Scott Teige

---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1.  !PerfSonar reliability continues to be a concern.
      * Service is now in "Development" status, SLA is formally inoperative, done in consultation with the ET.
      * During disk upgrade, existing data was corrupted. A partial recovery has been completed and local (IU) experts are being consulted.
   2. Front Line Support and Operational Services meet SLA definitions. (see 1)
      * [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]]
      * an outage of OIM (lasting a few hours) occurred, a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMCertificateIssuingRCA][description is available]]
   3. GRNOC that provides service desk staffing and tools are negotiating a contract with Service Now
      * Specific dates remain unknown
      * Many possible affects for ticketing exchange and presentation
      * This is still several months away, but will take planning and coordination with our collaborators
         * EGI, WLCG, FNAL, BNL
      * An agreement with GRNOC providing 24x7 coverage is being negotiated. This may go away, the ET is aware of this. 
   4. RHEL5 !EoL goals met: [[http://monitor.grid.iu.edu/kernel/kernel_overview_el5.html][Conversion status]]
      * JIRA conversion completed
      * No concerns for remaining machines
   5. Gracc-apel reporting interface has been written
      * Final element of the transition to UNL to complete 23/May (ssm transport of report to APEL)
   6. Campus Queue paper submitted to PEARC17 
      * Paper was rejected, Scott will still attend (NOLA, July 9-13)
      * (FYI, early registration ends 31/May)
   7. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond. 
      * Will implement CILogon 1.0, 2.0 is in year 1 of 3 year development.
      * Initial project plan and research at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycLx_AqAxbhEeSNklQq5RAg3TTsMVIuib7hiXFSGoH4/edit?usp=sharing][Google Doc]]
   8. No updates planned during the first cycle of July due to holidays/vacations. 
      * 4/July is a Tuesday. Updates (and repairs) are possible if conditions require them
   9. Long term projects and directions
      * Reduce the hardware owned and administered by OSG Operations
         * Depend on OSG organizational institutions cloud type services
         * Never get to 100%, but should get as close as possible
         * We've been moving backwards with new !perfSONAR and new VM hosts added
      * Update service environment to a more standard configuration management system
         * Ansible based configuration management is in place
   10. Configuration management at operations
      * All operations services (except !MyOSG) are under [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ansible_intro.md][Ansible]] based configuration management
         * !MyOSG is currently being added
      * Ansible files, "playbooks", etc. are, in turn, under SVN version control.
      * Ansible encapsulates all aspects of a service
         * VM specification, OS, RAM, CPU, /usr/local/, all service configuration and packages
      * Ansible is invoked by a master machine, not run by the target machine
      * It can update a running machine or build a new one
      * Handles development, ITB and production instances with a single playbook
         * ensures, to the extent possible, the testing instances are identical to the production instances
      * We are gaining experience and working on a "Best Practices" guide
         * Software team has expressed interest in participating in this

---+++ Goals and Metrics Update (Year4)
   1. Many of these are behind due to staffing discussed above.
   2. Goal #5 - "Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort."
      * Additional hardware in place for production services providing a home for this work.
      * Ansible capabilities make service installation and repair nearly trivial
      * Effort required for a *new* service depends on what is requested
      * Automating rebuild via Ansible from backup is next major effort.
   3. Goal #6 - "Continue to provide training on new technologies to equip support desk staff to troubleshoot issue as they are reported." - Working with UCSD !GlideIn Ops to provide access to logs and common problems documentation so Ops support can do more in depth and proactive troubleshooting of !GlideInWMS problems. Kyle and Rob G are talking about offloading user support tasks to the ops support desk. 
   4. Goal #7 - "Develop and share a set of metrics that provide a reasonable measure of responsiveness to stakeholder tickets." - See draft document at - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/QATicket
