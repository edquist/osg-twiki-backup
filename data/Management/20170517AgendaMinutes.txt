---+++ Events
   1. BDII SLA became inoperative 31/Mar, hardware was shutdown shortly thereafter. No reports of difficulty were reeived.
   2. Alain Deximo currently on terminal leave, Chris Pipes on paternity leave, but also terminal.
   3. All-Hands Meeting Complete
   4. Series of constant tweets during AHM seemed to go over well and gained us some exposure.
   5. We have a set of 7 solid leads for research highlights from AHM.  There are likely more to be found.

---+++ Concerns
   * Need more Research Highlight subject matter (We have a start with AHM info, but need more)

---+++ Goals
   * Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.

---++ Operations, by Scott Teige

---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1.  !PerfSonar reliability continues to be a concern.
      * Service is now in "Development" status, SLA is formally inoperative, done in consultation with the ET.
      * During disk upgrade, existing data was corrupted. A partial recovery has been completed and local (IU) experts are being consulted.
   2. Front Line Support and Operational Services meet SLA definitions. (see 1)
      * [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][Service Level Agreements]]
      * an outage of OIM (lasting a few hours) occured, a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMCertificateIssuingRCA][description is available]]
   3. GRNOC that provides service desk staffing and tools are negotiating a contract with Service Now
      * Specific dates remain unknown
      * Many possible affects for ticketing exchange and presentation
      * This is still several months away, but will take planning and coordination with our collaborators
         * EGI, WLCG, FNAL, BNL
      * An agreement with GRNOC providing 24x7 coverage is being negotiated. This may go away, the ET is aware of this. 
   4. Final move of legacy contents from software.grid.iu.edu
      * Alias to repo.grid.iu.edu operational, last CA distro was repo.grid only
      * repo-itb at RHEL6, production instances to RHEL6 28/Mar
      * can shutdown software1/2 at any time
   5. RHEL5 !EoL goals met: [[http://monitor.grid.iu.edu/kernel/kernel_overview_el5.html][Conversion status]]
      * JIRA conversion completed
      * No concerns for remaining machines
   6. Gracc-apel reporting interface has been written
      * final elements of the transition to UNL to complete 23/May
   7. Campus Queue paper submitted to PEARC17 
      * Paper was rejected, Scott will still attend (NOLA, July 9-13)
      * (FYI, early registration ends 31/May)
   8. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond. 
      * Will implement CILogon 1.0, 2.0 is in year 1 of 3 year development.
      * Initial project plan and research at [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycLx_AqAxbhEeSNklQq5RAg3TTsMVIuib7hiXFSGoH4/edit?usp=sharing][Google Doc]]
   9. No updates planned during the first cycle of July due to holidays/vacations. 
      * 4/July is a Tuesday. Updates (and repairs) are possible if conditions require them
   10. Long term projects and directions
      * Reduce the hardware owned and administered by OSG Operations
         * Depend on OSG organizational institutions cloud type services
         * Never get to 100%, but should get as close as possible
         * We've been moving backwards with new !perfSONAR and new VM hosts added
      * Update service environment to a more standard configuration management system
         * Ansible based configuration management is in place
   11. Configuration management at operations
      * All operations services (except !MyOSG) are under [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ansible_intro.md][Ansible]] based configuration management
         * !MyOSG is currently being added
      * Ansible files, "playbooks", etc. are, in turn, under SVN version control.
      * Ansible encapsulates all aspects of a service
         * VM specification, OS, RAM, CPU, /usr/local/, all service configuration and packages
      * Ansible is invoked by a master machine, not run by the target machine
      * It can update a running machine or build a new one
      * Handles development, ITB and production instances with a single playbook
         * ensures, to the extent possible, the testing instances are identical to the production instances
      * We are gaining experience and working on a "Best Practices" guide
         * Software team has expressed interest in participating in this

---+++ Goals and Metrics Update (Year4)
   1. Many of these are behind due to staffing discussed above.
   2. Goal #5 - "Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort."
      * Additional hardware in place for production services providing a home for this work.
      * Ansible capabilities make service installation and repair nearly trivial
      * Effort required for a *new* service depends on what is requested
   3. Goal #6 - "Continue to provide training on new technologies to equip support desk staff to troubleshoot issue as they are reported." - Working with UCSD !GlideIn Ops to provide access to logs and common problems documentation so Ops support can do more in depth and proactive troubleshooting of !GlideInWMS problems. Kyle and Rob G are talking about offloading user support tasks to the ops support desk. 
   4. Goal #7 - "Develop and share a set of metrics that provide a reasonable measure of responsiveness to stakeholder tickets." - See draft document at - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/QATicket

---+++ Concerns and Issues
   2. IPv6
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Sandbox/OperationsServicesIPv6CompatibilityTable][TWiki Page]]
      * Not much activity for Ops

---+++ Communications, by Kyle Gross
   * For BDII, there needs to be one last announcement. Then, there was discussion about making sure there is an actual end-of-life, not just end-of-support. To that end, Scott selected Tuesday, April 4th, at 9 a.m. Eastern Time to power off the BDII hosts. If this causes an uproar (which it should not), it may be possible to turn them back on briefly, but of course there are no guarantees that this would work.
   * Social media efforts during the AHM seemed to be useful. So perhaps for next time, we should ask for social media IDs at least from presenters to make sharing and highlighting easier.
   * There were many leads for Research Highlights articles from the AHM, but Kyle still wants more and will comb through the AHM schedule for further ideas.
   * Alain Deximo and Chris Pipes are leaving the OSG and are already out of the office.

---+++ Operations, by Scott Teige
   * Operations continue to go well, except for the central perfSONAR services which has been dropped from a production SLA to development status.
   * Automating rebuild via Ansible from backup is next major effort.
   * There is very slow progress toward Service Now in the GRNOC, but the belief is that the change will happen someday.
   * Marina is still working on Single Sign On (SSO) and CILogon.

---+++ Concerns (for both areas)
