---+++ Events
   1. Alain Deximo currently on terminal leave, Chris Pipes on paternity leave, but also terminal. May 31 is their final day of employment.
   2. PEARC17 has asked us to make a lot of announcements.  These will continue until July.
   3. Currently 3 Research Highlights in the pipeline.
   4. BDII shut down 4/Apr, no complaints
   5. Requests for adding accounting info to main OSG Website - deciding how to approach this. (display.grid... or gracc itself?)

---+++ Concerns
   * Need more Research Highlight subject matter (We have started with AHM info, but it's not always worked out)
   * Current change in effort within my Operations Support group has stressed effort levels. The adjustment period has greatly shifted my effort, though I am swinging back towards a more normal schedule. 
   * Lesser concern - Cleanup of FNAL mailing lists is tough. I've asked, but it is not always easy for me to become the admin any given mailing list. Though there is some progress. I will forge on.


---+++ Goals
   * Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.
   * Continue and expand Ansible (see below) integration into Operations.

---++ Operations, by Scott Teige

---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1. Configuration management at operations
      * All operations services (except !MyOSG) are under [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ansible_intro.md][Ansible]] based configuration management
         * !MyOSG is currently being added
      * Ansible files, "playbooks", etc. are, in turn, under SVN version control.
      * Ansible encapsulates all aspects of a service
         * VM specification, OS, RAM, CPU, /usr/local/, all service configuration and packages
      * Ansible is invoked by a master machine, not run by the target machine
      * It can update a running machine or build a new one
      * Handles development, ITB and production instances with a single playbook
         * ensures, to the extent possible, the testing instances are identical to the production instances
   1. TWiki retirement dates:
      * To read only 1/Oct, !EoL ~31/Dec
      * Actively converting some documents (SLAs)
      * Switching other uses to !GitHub
   1. Will end Tuesday only maintenance with !TWiki retirement
      * Will still announce 1 week in advance, ITB instance will be available for testing.
   1. No updates planned during the first cycle of July due to holidays/vacations. 
      * 4/July was a Tuesday. Updates (and repairs) are possible if conditions require them
   1.  !PerfSonar reliability continues to be a concern.
      * Service is now in "Development" status, SLA is formally inoperative, done in consultation with the ET. 
      * During disk upgrade, existing data was corrupted. Service operators attempting recovery from local instances.
   1. Will propose a Service Management System for all of OSG
      * [[http://fitsm.itemo.org/][FitSM]] seems like a very good fit, lightweight but complete.
      * Compare to ISO 20000, Other ITIL based instances.
      * Will need sign on by other service operators in OSG
   7. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond. 
      * Recent progress: ticket-dev is working, oim-dev is not.
 
---+++ Goals
   2. Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort.
      * Nearing completion, see above.
      * Automating rebuild via Ansible from backup (where appropriate) is in the pipe.
