---+ Operations Area July 25th, 2012

---++ Key Initiatives

---+++ !DigiCert Development and Testing
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/PKIOpsImpact][Operations Impact Statement]]
   * Alain Deximo is working on the first drafts RA Operations documentation
      * The !DigiCert version of this [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/OsgRaOperations][Document]]
   * Testing now live at https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificaterequestuser
      * Login first if you are in OIM
   * See images below for screenshot of Admin Interface

---+++ Improve Efficiency of Services 
   * Move from DNS RR to LVS completed
      * BDII is the exception due to it's geographical setup (No VLAN that is multi-campus)
      * Is there still a need for this geographical split?
   * KVM VMs
      * We now have a mix of VMWare and KVM
         * VMWare Server 1 has reached EOL
         * Consolidation of Installation Scripts
   * Move to RHEL6 from RHEL5

---+++ Support Staff Training
   * [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/WebHome#Training_Sessions][Training Sessions]]
      * July Training on [[https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/GlideInWMSTraining][Glide-In Factory]]
      * August/September SRM?
         * Who is the best person for this?

---++ Concerns and Issues

---+++ !DigiCert Deployment
   * This will be heavy operationally see impact statement above
   * Solid documentation and heavy testing is a focus
      * Though I still expect some issues when we go live in October
---+++ Sustaining Effort for Engineering after !DigiCert Deployment
   * We currently have some effort donated by the GRNOC to help
      * This ends on July 31st though I have asked for an extension until August 31st
      * I'd like to sustain Alain Deximo's full time to engineering to increase the Soichi Bus Factor
---+++ Catching up upon Completion of PKI Development
   * With recent focus on PKI several minor items are piling up for other services

---++ WBS Status

---+++ No SLA concerns
   * All Services well above required Availability
---+++ No Interoperability concerns
   * Will be doing a couple of talks at EGI Technical forum in September
      * Interoperability Update
         * Ongoing Monitoring, Accounting, Ticketing Interoperability
         * GLUE 2.0 Plans
         * SHA2 Plans
      * PKI Development and Deployment
---+++ Only Minor Ticketing Concerns
