---++ Minutes

Goals
   1. USCMS and USAtlas to demonstrate uses cases of the network monitoring infrastructure: 50%.
   2. Produce API to access datastore metrics: 15%
   3. Create network cost/bandwidth matrix for USAtlas and USCMS: 50%
   4. Network alarming components for OSG: 0%

Key Initiatives
   1. Improving perfSONAR toolkit: OSG contributed fixes to v3.5
   2. Outreach - LHCONE / LCHOPN / PerfSONAR developers, PuNDIT
   3. Analytics: MadAlert goal is to alert on network problems; now analyzes meshes from different MaDDash instances (e.g. ITB vs. prod; ipv4 vs ipv6). Networking data into ElasticSearch for analysis e.g. firewall problems.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Significant effort to debug problematic perfSONAR instance (e.g. MIT@OSG)
   2. Still some issues with the overall system - under investigation e.g. missing data; 15 problematic site perfSONAR instances e.g. <4GB RAM
   3. Stability of OSG Network datastore services after upgrades. Need to develop old data retention process by 3/16.

Key Accomplishments
   1. OSG Network datastore transitioned to production as of Sep 14. Transition project closed on Nov 9.
   2. Networking data published to CERN Active MQ bus
