*Note for presenters:* Please report on updates to the area goals we had established at the staff retreat; these goals are available at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1232. Remember that the next OSG annual report for each area will explicitly state the goals and the results.

---++ Technology, by Brian Bockelman

---++ Minutes

*Attendees:* Brian&nbsp;B., Brian&nbsp;L., Ken, Kyle, Rob&nbsp;Q., Scott, Susan, Tim&nbsp;C., Tim&nbsp;T.

---+++ Technology

   * *StashCache* is seeing consistent, serious use but from a relatively low (single-digit) number of users. LIGO, in particular, benefits from production use of authenticated !StashCache, which is reducing the total amount of inbound network traffic to Syracuse University.

   * *Singularity* is now deployed at more sites than !gLExec, in many cases due to site interest without regard to OSG. The OSG VO is able to detect and use Singularity when available, and up to 60% of opportunistic slots are doing so. The advantages of using Singularity so far are to replace !gLExec or, mostly, to provide a homogenous operating environment via an OSG VO-provided image; CMS is also starting to deploy and use its own custom image. As for !gLExec (and its eventual retirement), only CMS and FNAL are known users; CMS is moving away from it, and FNAL has made it optional and would not miss it if gone entirely.

   * Central OSG *OASIS* services has all been upgraded to EL&nbsp;7.3 operating systems now, which is a Good Thing operationally. Brian is working with the CVMFS developers to design and eventually implement a way to reduce update latency; aiming for an average update time of around 5 minutes. Rob Quick brought up the security blueprint meeting from a while back and the goal of reducing dependence on OASIS for CA certificate and CRL distribution; this is not forgotten and may be addressed by dropping CRLs entirely from Singularity images (if the Security Team approves).

   * As the initial development of *GR&Aring;CC* winds down, the focus shifts to making the transition to production. Brian will develop a plan to find hidden use cases and users of Gratia (database, !GratiaWeb, etc.) and cut over to GR&Aring;CC, including fallback options if there are issues.

   * With the *BDII* end-of-support date (31 March) looming, ATLAS has signed off on the OSG software as being sufficient to drop BDII. However, most US-ATLAS sites have not been updated in AGIS and some are not even running HTCondor-CE; also, some US-CMS sites have not decommissioned BDII yet either. Brian&nbsp;B. will follow up with CMS sites (including at the AHM), and Brian&nbsp;L. will be attending US-ATLAS Facilities meetings to better understand their status and needs.

   * Sites are moving from *SRM* systems (e.g., !BeStMan) to load-balanced !GridFTP setups, but this progress is being hampered by the lack of completed documentation in the OSG Software area. Three CMS sites have moved, though, and ATLAS sites are in progress; notably, ATLAS has stopped using SRM space reporting.

   * Work on the OSG *authz overhaul* continues apace, especially with the LCMAPS VOMS plugin and its associated changes. The software changes are done or nearly done, and now the configuration and templates need to be migrated. All of this will ship first in OSG 3.3, because it is new and therefore will not affect anyone except those sites willing to take the explicit steps required to enable it. Overall, good progress here.

   * And more generally, the picture for getting rid of GUMS in the longer term is becoming clearer. The main problem is that GUMS (and only GUMS) provides a pool account mechanism that CMS (at least) depends on. It may be possible to eliminate this use case rather than re-implement it outside of GUMS.

---+++ Concerns

   * The to-do list for OSG 3.4 is still large, but becoming clearer and is not growing. From Brian&nbsp;B.&rsquo;s perspective, a target of May is optimistic, June may be more realistic; Brian&nbsp;L. may have other ideas.
   * BDII deprecation is a race to the finish, driven by the external deadline of EL&nbsp;5 support ending. Things look OK today, but there could still be surprises.
   * The unfinished load-balanced !GridFTP documentation, as noted above.
