---++ Software, by Brian Lin

Since March 22, 2017.

---+++ Software updates
Development for April, May, and June releases:
   * VOMS Admin Server release candidate
   * LCMAPS VOMS plugin and osg-configure with accompanying update to emi-trustmanager-tomcat
   * Added OSG 3.4 support to osg-build
   * Added gsissh to osg-wn-client by request
   * Improvements to frontier-squid 3.5.24 scalability
   * Updated to !GlideinWMS 3.3.2 -- multiple remote directories for BOSCO submissions
   * Updated to HTCondor 8.6.3
   * Updated to Pegasus 4.7.4
   * Updated to !XRootD 4.6.1

---+++ VOMS Admin Server
After much surgery, we have a succesful build that has passed our automated integration tests but still needs thorough developer testing. Targeted for June release.

---+++ OSG 3.4
   * Dropping GUMS, !BeStMan, and VOMS Admin (https://opensciencegrid.github.io/technology/policy/voms-admin-retire/)
   * All packages build successfully but packaging modifications are required to account for the aforementioned dropped packages

---+++ LCMAPS VOMS plugin: edg-mkgridmap and GUMS replacement
   * osg-configure support added in the May release.
   * In progress: Documentation for installation and configuration, coordinating with friendly sites to transition away from old authentication systems.
   * To follow: Transition-specific documentation and/or tooling

---+++ BLAHP Unification
OSG and Flightworthy sources merged and building but not yet functional.

---+++ OSG Software Support for GR&Aring;CC
Carl completed the transition of OSG Display and APEL reporting scripts. He also contributed to the packaging of the OSG-APEL system for the infrastructure transition from Indiana to Nebraska.

---+++ Documentation Transition
Meeting notes now available here: https://opensciencegrid.github.io/technology/meetings/

---+++ New JIRA Version
The Software team tested the new version and put together a rubric to ensure coverage of Software project functionality.

---+++ Support
The Software team typically handles 1&ndash;2 active site support issues every week, in additional to other random GOC tickets that come our way. Since the last report, we have helped:
   * BU - Investigated possible causes of pool draining
   * BNL - Investigated missing CE ads from central collector
   * CTSC/IU - Ongoing HTCondor-CE and blahp installation, configuration, and building
   * CHTC - Assisted with GWMS Frontend upgrade and certificate renewal
   * FNAL - Discovered HTCondor proxy delegation errors
   * LBNL - Idle jobs, likely due to lack of SGE caching
   * Michigan - Assisted with CE installation and helped discover network issues caused by overaggressive routers
   * OU - Slurm Gratia probe failed to report over a span of a few days. Ongoing investigation
   * UW - Discovered HTCondor proxy delegation errors; fixed discrepancies with APEL reporting numbers

---+++ Concerns
   * Non-software projects have delayed progress on Year 5 goals
   * Aggressive GUMS deprecation timeline relegates sites to OSG 3.3

---+++ Software Goals for Year 5
