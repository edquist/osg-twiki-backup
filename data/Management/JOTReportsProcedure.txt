The US LHC Tier2 Activity (JOT) report shows the availability scores for each WLCG federation, as well as CPU consumption statistics.  These numbers are recorded using the RSV monitoring service and the Gratia accounting system, and are generally in agreement with the numbers reported by the WLCG.  These numbers are augmented with a few comments about the activity during the month.

---++Scope
