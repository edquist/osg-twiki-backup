---+!! Trash/Engagement report for 2009/02/05

---++ Key Engagements

<dl>
  <dt>UAB: SURA / Biology</dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Gaining experience with OSG Engage in native form (not trying to integrate SURA technology, just learning about OSG.Engage)</li>
      <li>Ran 1k jobs yesterday, first big successful run, going relatively smooth.</li>
      <li>Installed "R" and advertised via !ClassAd at ~50% of sites available to Engage - plan to leverage this to lure more users.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt>Duke - Physics</dt>
  <dd>Have meeting next week to discuss larger issues and scope of project.</dd>

  <dt>WRF at Nebraska</dt>
  <dd><ul><li>compiler mismatch between pre-processing and compute steps as predicted by Mats.</li>
          <li>moving forward on their end to resolve, ball is in their court.</li></ul>

  <dt>Jeff Alstott - Indiana University</dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Running Matlab locally at IU_OSG due to licensing</li>
          <li>this particular Matlab app is not well suited for Octave (order 10 slowdown in execution)</li></ul></dd>

  <dt>Jinbo</dt>
  <dd>Planning big runs soon, have a paper with citation but not published yet</dd>

  <dt>Greg Stiehr at the Genome Center WUSTL - via Sebastian</dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Mats sent mail two days ago, this is just starting</li>
          <li>users and possible resources</li>
          <li>If app runs well, potential of 2k core resource joining - but WAY too early to predict, just a possibility</li></ul></dd>

  <dt>BIO-IT World presentation at 1:45pm on April 28</dt>
  <dd>http://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/track1.asp</dd>

  <dt>PNNL</dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Researching, planning to attempt to arrange a visit for April-2009</li>
          <li>Working on PNNL's !MeDICi framework as bridge to OSG.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt>Working on CI-TEAM annual report</dt>

  <dt>ITER.</dt>
  <dd>Preliminary discussions at FNAL in December. Follow-up email with strategy suggestions and help offer last week. No reply so far.</li>

  <dt>NREL.</dt>
  <dd>High-level discussions between Ruth and Steve Hammond. Security issues due to proprietary / sensitive data. Discussions to continue.</dd>

  <dt>Nonproliferation and National Security Department at BNL</dt>
  <dd>Their image processing software (written in IDL) has been successfully run at NERSC. Condor was used for job submission and data transport. We are waiting for another batch of experimental data within a month, which will serve as a basis for an upcoming publication. We've been promised that OSG will be given full credit for the computation part of the study.</dd>

  <dt>Center for Functional Nano-materials at BNL</dt>
  <dd>Still very preliminary. There might be potential there. Letters sent to two different biology groups at BNL as well with no apparent success. Same applies to the letter sent to the Columbia U provost for research (and NYU vice president for research).</dd>

  <dt>Clemson</dt>
  <dd><ul><li>Paper in GPC09: The Trash/Deployment and Maintenance of a Condor-Based Campus Grid</li>
          <li>Collaboration with OSGEDU: machine set up at Clemson for use in tutorials.</li>
          <li>Continuing to advise new VO members and bring more sites on line.</li></ul></dd>

  <dt>NERSC.</dt>
  <dd>Ongoing contacts.
      
  <dt>Other overtures.</dt>
  <dd>Columbia, NYU, CUNY and SUNYSB. No replies so far.</dd>
</dl>

---++ WBS overview.
<ul><li>1.5.1.1: "DONE": Access available via Sharepoint to OSG staff on request basis. Wider access would need discussion.</li>
          <li>1.5.1.2: Ongoing, progress with Clemson / OSGEDU.</li>
          <li>1.5.1.3: DONE: VO-based reports weekly and monthly.</li>
          <li>1.5.1.4: Ongoing.</li>
          <li>1.5.1.5: Ongoing.</li>
          <li>1.5.2: Science communities: DONE.
          <ol><li>Earth Sciences.</li>
              <li>Genomics.</li>
              <li>Biochemistry.</li></ol>
          Production-level use is achieved and ongoing for all these communities.</li>
          <li>1.5.3: Almost DONE: SBGrid is an at large VO, working with OSG to ramp up operations.</li>
          <li>1.5.4: Ongoing: OSGMM.</li>
          <li>1.5.5: DONE: OSG/EE interoperability via WISDOM demonstrated at CERN. Currently no interest in uptake.</li>
          <li>1.5.6: Ongoing.</li>
</ul>

---++ Upcoming items round-up.

In general, engagement activities and outreach will continue. In particular:

<ul>
  <li>Ramp up contacts with NREL, PNNL, Duke.</li>
  <li>Continue with MPI at NERSC and developing ability to run MPI jobs at multiple sites with minimum effort.</li>
</ul>
