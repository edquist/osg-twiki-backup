*Generic Information Provider*

The Generic Information Provider (GIP) provides information services for the OSG. It collects information--such as the number of CPUs available and the amount of disk space remaining--about your system, provides it to CEMon, and publishes it to the OSG Grid Operations Center in a standard format. GIP is grid-agnostic; it can be integrated into the configuration and installation of middleware. More information
