*Hadooop*

Hadoop is an open-source data processing framework that includes a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed file system, HDFS. Although HDFS was designed to work in conjunction with Hadoop's job scheduler, the US Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment has re-purposed it to serve as a grid storage element by adding GridFTP and SRM servers. A full review of the capability and operational stability was performed for the collaboration.   HDFS is now installed at six sites on OSG; five are a data storage solution for CMS at the LHC, and one is a test site for LIGO at Caltech. Hadoop is being prepared for inclusion in the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT).  Apache hadoop, 2009, More information.

*Generic Information Provider*

The Generic Information Provider (GIP) provides information services for the OSG. It collects information--such as the number of CPUs available and the amount of disk space remaining--about your system, provides it to CEMon, and publishes it to the OSG Grid Operations Center in a standard format. GIP is grid-agnostic; it can be integrated into the configuration and installation of middleware. More information
