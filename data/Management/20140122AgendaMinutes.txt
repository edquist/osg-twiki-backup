---++ Software - Tim Cartwright

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 16 October 2013:

   * Completed support for and helped define and release OSG 3.2 release series
   * Dealt with several fires: Java dependencies, 512-bit proxies (Java & !OpenSSL), Globus GSI issues
   * New version of Globus Toolkit (5.2.5) from EPEL is now in testing
   * Introduced a significantly new way of running tests of OSG Software using !HTCondor’s VM universe
   * Contributed to releases: [[Documentation.Release3.Release3126][3.1.26]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3127][3.1.27]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3128][3.1.28]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3129][3.1.29]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release320][3.2.0]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release321][3.2.1]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release322][3.2.2]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release323][3.2.3]]
      * Improved usability of the “empty” packages
      * Added cctools packages
      * Added major new version of !glideinWMS 3.2.x
      * Updated to CVMFS 2.1.15
      * Updated to !XRootD 3.3.3
      * Updated to !gLExec 0.9.9
      * Routine certificate and VO package updates

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * WBS 1.x: Ongoing

   * [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][WBS 2.1: Transition from Oracle Java 6 to !OpenJDK 7]] &mdash; <span style="color: #F60;">complete!</span>

   * WBS 2.2: Add support for SLURM resource management system &mdash; <span style="color: #F60;">complete!</span>

   * [[SoftwareTeam.SP021_NewVersions][WBS 2.3: Prepare for OSG 3.2 and beyond (aka “OSG Next”)]] &mdash; <span style="color: #F60;">complete!</span>

   * WBS 2.4: Merge in latest Globus Toolkit changes, including upstreamed patches &mdash; in progress, expected release 2014-02-11

   * WBS 3.1: Unify HTCondor RPMs
      * Turned over to the HTCondor/Release team
      * Waiting for an official HTCondor release to include them (!TimT)
      * Plan to release 8.1.x using unified source RPM in Upcoming

   * WBS 3.2: Take over Debian support: transitioned to HTCondor/Release team

   * WBS 3.3: Release HTCondor-CE
      * Support for HTCondor batch system complete
      * Still working on PBS support &mdash; this is taking a long time
      * Others to come eventually

   * WBS 4.1: Move Globus patches upstream
      * Submitted many of our patches to Globus
      * Not included in Globus Toolkit 5.2.5
      * Waiting for them to be integrated and released; Globus Toolkit 6.0?

   * WBS 4.3: Join EPEL and donate some packages &mdash; would like to get started on this effort soon

   * WBS 5.1: Simplify test development by improving test framework
      * Many small improvements and bug fixes, based on new VMU tests
      * VMU testing has taken priority, so no progress on osg-test 2.0
      * Will rewrite sequencing engine, express tests as DAG, and randomize topological sort (more diversity)

   * WBS 5.2: Run tests as normal jobs locally and perhaps in OSG
      * Automatically running 324 test runs daily: all 6 supported platforms, 9 repository selections, 6 top-level packages
      * Simple HTML reporting [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tests/latest.html][is available]]
      * Old test system has been decommissioned
      * Just working out a few last kinks and then the initial deployment will be done

   * WBS 6.1: 2013 OSG User School &mdash; Just need to wrap up finances with SDSC
   * WBS 6.2: 2014 OSG User School &mdash; Starting to plan 2014 School, 7&ndash;10 July (students arrive 6 July)

   * Other
      * OSG Technology planning micro-retreat, 6 February (Thursday)
      * Help build a Madison ITB site to further all team members’ understanding of how to run an OSG site

---+++ Top Concerns

   * The backlog of useful work is still significant and continues to grow. We will find a better way to track, understand, and manage this backlog.

   * We need to define and implement a basic disaster recovery plan. I keep saying this&hellip; so maybe after the Globus Toolkit updates are complete (which they nearly are), I will ask Mat to start on this task.

   * There has been little to no effort put into documentation lately. We are shifting the responsibility for this area back to Software and will draft a plan to address missing, incomplete, and out-of-date documents.

   * We seem to be tracking upstream software changes tolerably well, even without a systematic process. Some risk of missing an important update remains, but coverage is good enough that there may be little to gain by being more comprehensive.

---+++ Stakeholder Requests

   * [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/REQUESTS-28][REQ-28]]: Scheduling glidein jobs with respect to job owners authN/authZ privileges
      * Pinged Igor in the ticket today
      * Last comment (May 2013) asked whether OSG Software work is complete and, if not, what remains to be done
