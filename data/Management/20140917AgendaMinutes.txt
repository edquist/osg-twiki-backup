---++ Condor-CE Deployment Update - All

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/CondorCETransitionPlan

---++ Campus Grids - Rob Gardner

---+++ Key initiatives

   * Providing a virtual cluster environment:
      * Distributed Environment Modules for providing common user applications (system now deployed, adding applications).
   * OSG Connect user job monitoring - in progress
      * logging into osgconnect.net now provides user-specific gratia snapshots.
   * Continuous validation in production: http://build.ci-connect.net:8080/, working well. (Anton Yu, UC undergraduate)
      * This is all done and working fine.  A summarizing memo has been written and will be uploaded to docdb.
   * Bala Desinghu started 8/15
      * Ramping up on DHTC: OSG Connect book, DAGMAN
      * Working with David Champion on github organization of SWC+OSG (see below)
      * Goal is to have a bootcamp template that can easily be replicated/extended, like SWC.  Working with Loren. 
   * New OSG Connect endpoint - !OrangeGrid
      * Syracuse: Large opportunistic Condor cluster 8000 cores at night in VMs, 4k in the day, mostly Ubuntu and RH, working through issues (firewall, IP connectivity, shared file system, Condor pools). Lincoln Bryant at UC working on initial setups.
         * Agreeable to add CVMFS to their VM image, configured to mount OASIS. 
   * St. Louis University: SGE cluster of 75 machines. Stalled for the time being.  Will get back to it when higher priority tasks completed.
   * Campus grids based on CI Connect   
      * UMich Connect:  (login, portal complete; compute nodes cannot communicate outside campus).  Idea now is to setup persistent ssh tunnel for specific condor ports.
      * UChicago CI Connect
         * Working out details of Bosco to be able to submit from the login host on the home cluster, as an installed module (requires local admin support).  (Make is simpler to support). The issue is providing capability to submit to local queue using vanilla universe.
         * Once working, will serve as a good model.
      * ATLAS Connect - no issues
      * CMS Connect - meeting with CMS Tier3 team; decided first resource target would be CMS VO front-end.  Burt Holzman to check out policy issues of CMS Connect access to the LPC. 
      * Syracuse CI Connect (meeting Oct 3 for phase 2)
   * New initiative with User Support: Software Carpentry + OSG Campus Bootcamps
   * Work from Anna Olson (UC student) exploring data delivery network ideas:
      * https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1201


---+++ Top Issues/Concerns
   * The usual concern - attracting (and keeping) users, making it simpler for users to access OSG.
   * Streamlining and broadening the support for OSG Connect users.  Suchandra, Bala providing support, but can it be broadened?


---+++ Key Accomplishments
   * User monitoring by site: https://visualize.ci-connect.net/JobAnalysis/job-table/job-table2.html?hours=168&decoration=plain&site=osg
   * User happiness (Anton Betton, Colorado, Orbiter project) <pre> Hi Suchandra,
   just a quick note that everything is going extremely well with my computations on the OSG. 
   I start 10K jobs one day and the next day they are done. Fantastic!
   I am probably more than 50% done by now, and I am trying hard to complete before my 
   next conference in Germany (in less than two weeks). If I can report that the classification is finished 
   and confirm the published result, that would be great.</pre>
   * Cycles delivered:
