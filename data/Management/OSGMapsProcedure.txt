%TOC%

OSG Maps are available from the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?map_attrs_shownr=on&all_sites=on&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on][MyOSG portal]]

For a presentation a good solution is to use the Google Earth version of the map. 

Install Google Earth on your machine. 

Download the [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map/kml][MyOSG Map KML file]] and rename to have a .kml extension. 

Select the kml. Once you have the map in Google Earth make the size as you want.  Ensure you have only "borders and labels" selected and not other options. 

Select View, View Size, Print Output size that you want. 
Use the File menu to save the map as an Image

Now the question is whether this can all be done from a script? 

The old  OSG map is located in OSG Doc DB under document # 766-v8 and marked as obsolete.
