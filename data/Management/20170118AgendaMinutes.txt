Key Initiatives
   1. 1.3B h total in 2016; weekly peaks above 30M h, with consistent growth over the last 6 months, with ATLAS and CMS at about 3/8 of the total each.
   2. 2016 opportunistic total 270M h, averaging 5M h per week with peaks of 8M h. Syracuse is #1 site with 75M h total, 3x the next highest (FNAL). Don Krieger is #1 project / user with 27M h, followed by AMS with 22M h.
   3. In the last 90 days: SU top opportunistic site with 17 Mh; Stanford through BOSCO now visible at 826K h.
   4. New sites - JINR: aiming for production next week; Utah, large increase in hours in the past month; Ole Miss, COlorato, Puerto Rico: running opportunistic glideins.
   5. GPUs - Tusler (HCC) in use by IceCube and OSG; Fermilab VO interested. In discussions with BNL.
   6. Plan for all critical GRACC issues to be addressed by the AHM.

Top Issues / Concerns
