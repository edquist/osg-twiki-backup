  <p>In the CMS collaboration, we welcome the start of   LHC’s new proton-proton run; in just a few days, we’ve already seen more than   eight inverse picobarns delivered to the detector (a picobarn is a common   measure in high energy physics for particle collisions and beam intensity).</p>
  <p>We have also begun configuring our OSG sites for   whole-machine (HTPC) jobs, and expect to be submitting   those workflows in earnest by the end of the year.</p>
  <p>Our glideinWMS deployment continues to grow as we upgrading the existing   infrastructure at Fermilab and add a new factory at CERN.</p>
  <p>Finally, at the recent OSG All Hands Meeting, we had   productive Tier-2 and Tier-3 workshops as we learned about the latest in cluster   management techniques, global data placement services via xrootd, and   configuring sites for multi-core jobs.</p>

  <strong>ATLAS Production</strong>
  <p>ATLAS data processing activities in March were   dominated by simulation, heavy ion reprocessing and a steady demand for   analysis. The first 2011 collision data became available for user analysis   following prompt reconstruction at the Tier-0 center at CERN; the reconstruction occurred upon completion of the   36-hour calibration loop. As was expected due to given LHC machine parameters, increased pileup values between 2.8   and 5.8 were observed, leading to increased processing resource usage. ATLAS plans to mitigate the latter by introducing software   improvements in early April.</p>
  <p>ATLAS is in the process of implementing a data model   to help cope with computing and storage resource limitations. Moving away from   long term storage of bulky data formats like Event Summary Data (ESD) to more compact formats like Analysis Object Data (AOD) and derived ESDs (DESD) will   result in a significant reduction of disk storage requirements. If ATLAS used the 2010 data placement model, 25 PB of disk   capacity worldwide would be needed by the end of 2011. With the new model, which   includes additional measures like event size reduction and a reduction of the   number of dataset replicas, this requirement is reduced to about 9 PB.</p>

  <p><strong>Talk with the Experts</strong>  
  <p>The pioneers who founded Open Science Grid used to attend Install Fests - technical sessions where site administrators and software developers gathered in one room to install early releases of the OSG software stack.</p>
  <p>In the same spirit, this year's All Hands Meeting included a &quot;Talk with the Experts&quot; session on Thursday morning (10/3). Although OSG software is now more tested, documented and simpler to install, the community has grown and diversified. We feel that the community's growth has created a need for this sort of &quot;exchange&quot;.</p>
  <p>Fourteen experts published information to instruct the attendees and to stimulate the discussion in advance on the <a href="https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SiteCoordination/ExpertsAtAllHands2011">OSG Twiki</a>. The meeting was held in the inspiring Benjamin Waterhouse Room of the Harvard School of Medicine where most attendees, approximately 40 in person and a few via phone, convened with clear objectives. Their preparation helped to make the session both valuable and informative.</p>
  <p>Once everyone introduced themselves, their areas of expertise and their goal for the morning, the assembly broke up into these smaller work and discussion groups. Here are some of the topics: New members with little OSG and computing experience were quickly brought up to speed and installed their first resources. Expert site administrators discussed changes and optimizations. One group discussed job submission. Another group discussed with a communication expert how to give more visibility to their research.</p>
  <p>Attendees told the organizers that they found the event helpful, making it a success for both them and the OSG.</p>

    <p><strong>Operations 10K Ticket Milesteone</strong></p>
    <p>On February 22, 2011 at 7:27pm UTC, the OSG Grid Operations Center hit the 10,000 ticket milestone.   While there was nothing special about this ticket in particular, as it was   resolved within four hours, it does serve as a reminder of the effort put forth   by all members of the OSG Operations Support team, and   the progress we have made together.</p>
    <p>All GOC members, past and present, deserve thanks for   getting us to this point. I would like to specifically thank the OSG Operations Support Team that works with me every day to   resolve these tickets: Elizabeth Chism, Alain Deximo, and Chris Pipes. You all   deserve considerable thanks for getting us to this milestone.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would like to thank all members of the OSG   Community for helping us reach this important milestone. We look forward making   even more progress so that we can better serve your needs for the next 10,000   tickets.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://nees.org">George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation</a>(NEES) is a National Science Foundation-funded organization whose primary goal is to reduce the impact of seismic disasters through engineering innovation and research. NEES uses an open source program 
    called <a href="http://opensees.berkeley.edu/">OpenSees</a> for simulation of the seismic response of structural 
    and geotechnical systems.</p>
  <p>When studying the seismic response of a structural or geotechnical system, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate the system under 
    numerous earthquake ground motions and under different levels of 
    ground shaking, a process that can require hundreds of day-long analysis runs.</p>
  <p>Running these analyses simultaneously can greatly reduce the amount 
    of time that a researcher needs to wait for results. Towards this 
    end, the OSG User Support team has been working with NEES over the 
    past eight weeks to integrate OpenSees with the OSG infrastructure. 
    Considering that the application workflow is well suited for the 
    model of independently parallel jobs, the integration required only 
    minimal modifications to run on a distributed high throughput computing infrastructure such as OSG.</p>
  <p>Working as a researcher at the University of Washington, I used this 
    prototype integration to successfully analyze the seismic response of 
    the innovative Self-Centering Steel Plate Shear Wall (SC-SPSW) system.
    This new structural system consists of thin steel plate walls with 
    beams and columns that are connected to each other with 
    post-tensioned tendons. The steel plate walls are able to dissipate 
    the energy of an earthquake while the post-tensioned tendons act like 
    rubber bands to recenter a building and bring it back to an upright 
    configuration after an earthquake, greatly reducing the damage to the 
    building and the subsequent repair costs following a seismic event.</p>
  <p>The computational models of the SC-SPSW system uses OpenSees and, 
    with the help of Marko Slyz and Gabriele Garzoglio of the OSG User 
    Support team, we were able to subject these simulated walls to a 
    series of earthquake ground motions using the OSG computational resources.</p>
  <p>The results of these dynamic analyses showed that the SC-SPSW system 
    was able to recenter following design level earthquakes and prevent 
    costly damage to beams and columns, making it a viable method of reducing the impact of seismic disasters in the future.</p>
  <p>These analyses required about 300 jobs that ran for an estimated 2400 
    hours. Besides producing useful results, these runs have helped to 
    show that the prototype is practical. For the near term future, NEES 
    is working with the OSG User Support team to reliably run jobs for 
    longer than 24 hours, a challenge for the dynamic nature of OSG 
    resources. For the longer term future, NEES will be working with OSG in two directions. One is a demonstration of sustained production use that involves more researchers who use OpenSees. Another direction is the ongoing  integration of the OSG glidein-based workload management system with the NEEShub portal, which will enable support for other applications in addition to OpenSees.</p>

  <strong>Open Science Grid - 2011 All Hands Meeting</strong>
<p><a href="https://www.opensciencegrid.org/images/AHM_2011_Low.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.opensciencegrid.org/images/AHM_2011_Low.jpg" width="233" height="156" align="left" longdesc="https://www.opensciencegrid.org/images/AHM_2011_Low.jpg"></a>Piotrek Sliz, leader of the of Harvard Medical School Structural Biology Grid (SBGrid) group, was the host of this year's OSG All Hands Meeting (AHM).</p>
      <p>The meeting was a great success, with over 150 participants from across the consortium and partner organizations. The venue served as the perfect setting to encourage engagement and set the tone for the presentations and discussions.</p>
      <p>You can see the talks <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=3627#all.detailed	">posted.</a>.</p>
      <p>Two keynotes were featured during the meeting. The first was from Dr. Gaël McGill, Director of Molecular Visualization at Harvard Medical School, who spoke about many aspects of molecular simulations and animations. The second keynote was given by John Huth, from ATLAS; he gave an excellent survey of the current big questions in high energy particle physics and how the LHC can help answer them. <br />
        <br />
        The US ATLAS and US CMS distributed facility groups once again held co-located meetings. Rob Snihur, the US CMS Tier-3 support coordinator says “..it was an excellent place to bring together high energy physicists and site administrators assessing the experience of analyzing early LHC data and showcasing their bright ideas for future directions - including the &quot;diskless&quot; site using an XROOTD wide area network.”<br />
  <br />
        A set of panels covered the large topics – national and global cyberinfrastructure (CI), and its future. Panelists included John Towns (TeraGrid), Steven Newhouse (European Grid Infrastructure), Wolfgang Gentzsch (DEISA), Phil Papadopoulus from SDSC, as well as representatives of the US earthquake engineering simulation projects Phil Maechlin (SCEC) and Rudi Eigenmann (NEEScomm).<br />
  <br />
        Our semi-annual Council face-to-face meeting covered the recent proposal submission. This included discussion of further plans for sustaining the consortium and its contributions to science, technology, and society.</p>
