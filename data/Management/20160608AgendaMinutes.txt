Also please remember that the next OSG annual report for each area will explicitly state the goals and the results.



---++ Tim Cartwright - Software

Since 6 April 2016.

---+++ Enterprise Linux 7

Good news, finally!

   * We shipped !BeStMan for EL&nbsp;7
   * We plan to ship GUMS for EL&nbsp;7 next Tuesday (14 June)

Because we do not plan to fix VOMS Admin for EL&nbsp;7 for general use, there is very little Java/EL&nbsp;7 work remaining.

---+++ SELinux

No updates since April; comments from then are repeated below.

With the move to EL&nbsp;7, we will need to provide support for SELinux, which is a new feature for the OSG software stack&nbsp;&mdash; we have long advised sites to disable SELinux on OSG hosts. The Software team is just getting its head around this task, but it turns out that Patrick Calhoun at Oklahoma is an SELinux guru and created many of the necessary rules for OSG software at their site. He is sharing his results and configuration, and they will provide an excellent start toward official OSG support. Also, the HTCondor developers are working on SELinux support. I expect this to be a significant project in Q4 and perhaps beyond.

---+++ HTCondor-CE

HTCondor-CE continues to take a fairly low and steady amount of Software effort, as appropriate for its age and increasingly widespread deployment. Most development is driven by specific site needs.

   * Added native SLURM support (which does not scale well yet)
   * Fixed bugs in PBS Pro and PBS-SLURM interfaces
   * Fixed critical bugs in HTCondor-CE-View
   * Worked on merging OSG and HTCondor developer versions of BLAHP patches
   * Added integration tests via Travis-CI

---+++ Releases

Reminder: OSG 3.2 has been deprecated since February and hence receives only critical updates (plus all CA certificate and VO client data updates). The End-Of-Life date for OSG 3.2 and support for EL&nbsp;5 is August 2016.

---+++ Other software updates

For users:
   * Dropped GRAM packages from OSG-CE metapackages
   * Shipped first release of HTCondor-CE-Bosco&nbsp;&mdash; still a little experimental
   * Added support in RSV for CREAM and !NorduGrid
   * Made several small improvements to !BeStMan
   * Made small improvements to OSG PKI tools
   * Made small improvements to OSG Configure
   * Miscellaneous: CVMFS (2.2 & 2.3), Gratia HTCondor probe, HTCondor (8.4, 8.5), LCMAPS (plugin), Pegasus 4.6, VO client data and CA certificates as needed

Internal:
   * Prepared our automated tests and VM images for SELinux testing
   * Reduced spurious failures in automated tests by improving Tomcat service starts
   * Added option for CILogon-like certificates to automated tests
   * Added Travis-CI integration for some packages

---+++ Documentation

Our documentation continues to receive light effort, but almost all of it is proactive and not reactive&nbsp;&mdash; in other words, we do not get a lot of complaints.

Also, we are active in the GOC project to update our documentation platform and processes.

---+++ Support

The Software team is averaging about 5 active site support issues every week, in additional to other random GOC tickets that come our way. Since the last report, we have helped:

   * AGLT2
   * BNL (RSV issues, SLURM walltime unit conversions)
   * BU
   * Clemson (PBS Pro and multicore jobs)
   * FIU (local issues, then increased pilots from 128 to 256)
   * Florida
   * Harvard (job router configuration)
   * MIT (configuration, GUMS configuration error)
   * OU (SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE troubles)
   * Syracuse
   * Texas Tech (CE configuration)
   * UC Riverside
   * UNESP (jobs were not returning output or logs)
   * Utah (lots of CE help, then they decided to go to HTCondor-CE-Bosco; then main admin quit)

---+++ Concerns

   * Long-term sustainability of our big Java software components:
      * !BeStMan: Need a roadmap for dropping it in OSG&nbsp;3.4.
      * VOMS Admin: We are trying to shift VOMS (and hence VOMS Admin) to hosted installations instead of site- or VO-operated installations. Waiting for dust to settle on CA transition, I think.
      * GUMS: We are going to live with this one for now. The new EL&nbsp;7 build uses updated security libraries, which helps. And we may be able to shift to newer, externally maintained ones down the road.

   * There is still no policy or procedure for using the GOC Yum software repository

---+++ Software Goals for Year 5
