Key Initiatives
   * Traceability findings presented to Fermilab CS Board. Committee was to be formed to draft changes to security policy changes to allow job submission without end user x.509 certificates. Have not heard back on progress. This is on the schedule for this Friday's CS Board meeting.
   * CILogon Basic CA adoption - Fermilab is now accepting CI Logon Basic CA certificates issued for individuals at University of Illinois, University of Wisconsin, University of Chicago, and Indiana University.
   * Ran test to see how many CEs have CI Logon Basic CA cert installed. Found 25/75 at 4-5 unique sites have it installed currently.
   * Operational security activities. 
      * There was an issue with a certificate in the OSG CA cert bundle expiring before the new version with a refreshed certificate was available. This was a case of the igtf lead time vs. the software release freeze time not quite matching up. In response we've set up a system to alert us if any CA cert is going to expire in the next 60 days.
      * New CA cert bundle released at end of June. Next expected at end of October.
      * Investigated possibility of ca cert bundles cleaning up orphan certificates on removal/upgrades. This functionality is coming in a future release of fetch-crl, so won't be added to the ca bundle rpms.
      * OSG-SEC-2013-06-19 Security vulnerability in Puppet allowed remote code execution.
      * OSG-SEC-2013-07-26 Security vulnerability in PHP allowed remote code execution.
      * OSG-SEC-2013-08-13 Security vulnerability in CVMFS allow for local privilege escalation.

Top Issues / Concerns

   * Mine out until October, Kevin Hill acting Security Officer.
   * Extending CILogon adoption: Now that we can check which sites are ready to accept CI Logon Basic certs, we can approach more VOs and offer CI Logon certs as an alternative, which should encourage more sites to accept them.


Key Accomplishments

   * Security Controls assessment mostly complete. Still waiting for a few straggler service owners to complete surveys.
   * Run security-related meetings with 1 new OSG VO. 1 more coming up.

---+++ Minutes

Key Initiatives
   1. Running jobs w/o user certificates: no policy roadblocks from Fermilab. Moving forward with the implementation.
   2. CILogon CA adoption: now Fermilab accepts the CA. It is the 5th site.
   3. Operational security

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. Mine is away until October; Kevin Hill ramping up acting as security officer.
   2. Explore the need for extending the use of CILogon CA (e.g. for data management) as the practice of running jobs w/o user certificates picks up.

Key Accomplishments
   1. Held a security-related meeting with a new VO. One more scheduled.
