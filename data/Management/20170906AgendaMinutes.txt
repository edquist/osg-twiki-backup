---++ Outreach, by Kyle Gross

---+++ Events
   1. VERITAS Article - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/veritas-and-open-science-grid-explore-extreme-window-into-the-universe/
   2. Molcryst Article - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/machine-learning-insights-into-molecular-science-using-the-open-science-grid/
   3. GRACC links added to OSG Website (About and Documentation pages)
   4. PEARC17 asked us to make a lot of announcements. We made a lot of announcements + tweets for them.
   5. Announced & Tweeted OSG User Support Training events
   6. Ongoing(?) - Series of announcements about OSG 3.4/Globus transitions

---+++ Concerns
   * Need more Research Highlight subject matter, though we have some direction. (!XENON1T, JLab)
   * We have cut effort for the writing of research highlights.  That task now falls to Rob and Kyle.
   * Lesser concern - Cleanup of FNAL mailing lists is tough. I've asked, but it is not always easy for me to become the admin any given mailing list. Though there is some progress. I will forge on.

---+++ Goals
   * Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.


---++ Operations, by Rob Quick
---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1. Configuration management at operations
      * All operations services (except !MyOSG) are under [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ansible_intro.md][Ans\
ible]] based configuration management
         * !MyOSG is currently being added
      * Ansible files, "playbooks", etc. are, in turn, under SVN version control.
      * Ansible encapsulates all aspects of a service
         * VM specification, OS, RAM, CPU, /usr/local/, all service configuration and packages
      * Ansible is invoked by a master machine, not run by the target machine
      * It can update a running machine or build a new one
      * Handles development, ITB and production instances with a single playbook
         * ensures, to the extent possible, the testing instances are identical to the production instances
   1. TWiki retirement target dates:
      * To read only 1/Oct, !EoL ~31/Dec
      * SLAs all converted, automated converter did most of the work
      * Switching other uses to !GitHub
      * Raw TWiki .txt files for selected webs have been saved elsewhere.
   1. Will end Tuesday only maintenance with !TWiki retirement
      * Announcement imminent (being reviewed by GRACC, glidein, oasis teams)
   1.  !PerfSonar remains in Development status.
   1. Will propose a Service Management System for OSG
      * [[http://fitsm.itemo.org/][FitSM]] seems like a very good fit, lightweight but complete.
      * Will present a prototype document early October
      * Will need sign on by other service operators in OSG, GRACC only for prototype document
   1. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond.
      * Recent progress: ticket and OIM near completion. !MyOSG lags, will reallocate effort to accelerate progress.
