---++ New Homepage for the Open Science Grid
It has been quite some time since the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view][OSG homepage]] has been remodeled. A 
[[http://www-itb.opensciencegrid.org/][new OSG homepage]] will replace it during the production release scheduled for
August 13th, 2013.

The new page has a considerably different "look and feel". It is aimed more at viewers not associated with the OSG.
Even so, ultimately all information currently available from the old homepage can be accessed from the new.

Unlike our current Twiki service, the new homepage can be accessed by anybody with a web browser (with or without X509 certificate). Also, unlike our current TWiki service, the new homepage will run on GOC's production web hosting service which uses LVS to ensure high availability during regular maintenance / unexpected outages.

Many people have contributed at many levels from technical implementation to design and content. Some of these contributors include Soichi Hayashi, Kimberly Myles, Ruth Pordes, Chander Seghal, Rob Quick and others.
 
---+++ The transition to the new page:
   * will be announced similarly to all other changes of GOC services. Expect the announcement on the first Tuesday of August.
   * is technically easy as is rollback to the previous configuration if needed.
   * will occur on the second Tuesday of August during a announced maintenance window.
   * has been approved by OSG management, particularly by the ET.
   * includes an already existing ITB instance which has been available for several months. The announcement will invite testing and comments.
   * depends on existing virtual machines on existing hosts also already in operation for several months.
   * can be deferred if serious problems are discovered after the invitation to test.

---+++ Some technical information
   * The new page is constructed with the Wordpress content management system and hosted by the OSG Grid Operations Center.
   * Editing the "high level" pages is currently restricted to a specific list of people. It is anticipated this list will grow as experience accumulates. Editing of templates associated with the pages is currently possible only by GOC staff. A few links into the content lands the user on per-existing TWiki pages. These are editable as before. 
   * The content is hosted on standard GOC infrastructure operated with the same policies and procedures used for other OSG infrastructure. It is anticipated the service level agreement, when finalized, will define the associated hosting infrastructure as a "Normal Priority" service.
   * The new homepage link given here is currently an ITB instance, old link will point to the old page until rollout.

---+++ A required addition
I (Scott) believe we are required by Indiana University to include a link to this [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/IUPrivacyPolicy][Privacy Policy]].
Event though the page is attributed to the OSG, it is hosted on infrastructure operated by IU employees. The link can be discreet, see for example,
[[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/home][OIM]]. The content is just the facts and we have had no objections to the policies described in it.
