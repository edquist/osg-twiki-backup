---++ Brief Overview of Goals

The primary goal of ANDSL is to shrink the time between 100Gbps network links becoming available, and the OSG
Science Stakeholders being able to benefit from their capacity. As we have very modest means within this project,
we are focusing on the following areas:

   * Creation of an easy to operate "load generator" that can generate traffic between Storage Systems on the Open Science Grid.
   * Instrumenting the existing, and emerging production software stack in OSG to allow benchmarking.
   * Benchmark the production software stack, identify existing bottlenecks, and work with the external software developers on improving
      the performance of this stack.

---++ Architecture Description

OSG is a Grid of "sites". Each site has compute and storage resources, and is connected to one or several of the major US Research Networks.
As of 2009, roughly a dozen sites have shared 10Gbps WAN connectivity, and a few have multiple 10Gbps links available to them.

The Storage Elements (SE) 
at the sites are generally distributed in nature. WAN data movement between two sites thus generally involves O(100) or more simultaneous flows
between these distributed SEs. This data movement is orchestrated via a layered software stack. The implementation details vary considerably
from site to site, and we will provide here only a conceptual description.

   * hardware layer: commodity disk systems with or without software or hardware RAID configuration. Disks are generally read from and written
     to simultaneously, from both LAN and WAN. The individual disk IO at the hardware layer that can be relied upon per flow is thus typically modest.
   * distributed filesystem layer: a variety of different technical implementations are deployed. They 
   * transfer protocol layer: gridftp is the de facto standard for WAN transfers, and there are at least two implementation of gridftp deployed. 
     LAN transfer protocols are much more heterogeneous, and it is conceivable that WAN transfers may become more heterogeneous in
     the future.
   * Storage Resource Management


---++ Activities, Papers and Publications

Part of the objective of this project is to assemble documentation on the performance of the Middleware stack.
In general, the work referred here is done in collaboration with a variety of partners. ANDSL does not own any hardware itself,
nor does it have the effort to do any serious development of Middleware. We thus depend on these collaborations in order to
achieve our goals.
