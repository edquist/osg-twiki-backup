---++ VORS new version Release - Leigh 
The GOC has developed two versions of VORS for review. 
a) VORS is an information aggregation display.
b) Calls an external services for information. Currently calls GridScan. Working on information from GIPs. 

There has been quite a bit of internal discussion about the design and layout which meets the "resource status" role 
  more effectively.  First for reference, 
here is the current production VORS: http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi

 The 3-1 version switchs from a geographical map to a line map and removes the buttons in favor of pulldown menus.
  VORS#3-1  http://vors-dev.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/kgindex.cgi for Text output:

  The second one has a day night map and reforms the buttons  in a space saving way. 
  VORS#3-2 http://vors-dev.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/jrindex.cgi

Votes: 3-1: Frank; Ruth; Doug; Kent;  3-2: 

Other updates include but are not limited, VO summaries have been removed; the resource listing has been updated to include the OSG version and the detailed table has been updated to place the access information first. No history kept. The Callout is responsible for history. Not VORS. VORS provides a client tool for the information. 

OSG Executive Team strategy that GOC is responsible for displaying the status of the OSG.
        The status of OSG  should be usable by  Applications.
        The display of the status of OSG should be usable for Communications/Outreach and PR. 
        The display should clearly show an OSG perspective with title, logo, description. The Federated infrastructures should be clearly marked as such. Model is OSG Federating with other Grids. 

Site Functional tests is an open issue at this time.  What is our roadmap for Site Functional Tests? GOC cannot provide this with current funding level. Need an offline meeting within the next 2 weeks to define Site Functional Test roadmap. Proposal to move ITB to VORS in next round.

Google Earth is functionally equivalent. Frank -- likes VORS very simple outline. Alain -- Text interface is a very nice way to get the information they need. Effort so far: 0.3 FTE dc a lot of work on interface to information. how does one get this now?
