   * I have begun looking at tools and data collected by the [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org][OSG Jira system]] as input to Assessment analysis
   * Two dashboards have been created: one for Software (including Gratia), the other for Operations. Both of these OSG communities seem to have taken to Jira, and the data collected there provides a window into those activities.
   * Of course the data is only a rough digitization of the true activity as not everything gets captured in the system, and being relatively new and without project-guidance & policy, there will be uneven interaction from the participants. 
   * Below is a portion of the Software Assessment dashboard <br /> %BR%
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_01.png" alt="screenshot_01.png" width='500' height='325' />    %BR% %BR%
   * which with the above caveat provides an interesting window into workload distribution among staff and others, eg. those with active tickets in Software currently:<br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_07.png" alt="screenshot_07.png" width='400' height='300' />    
   * Another is Created vs. Resolved issues which seems revealing: this gives an indication of the work backlog in Software, and the steady progress against it.  There are episodic changes in slope, but importantly the slopes of created and resolved tend to be the same meaning new work is being taken but not without old work getting resolved.
   * The changes in slope represent either productivity bursts or more difficult issues, especially in September. <br /> %BR%
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_04.png" alt="screenshot_04.png" width='400' height='300' />    %BR%
   * Compare same from the Operations Assessment dashboard: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_06.png" alt="screenshot_06.png" width='400' height='300' />    %BR%
   * Impression that some customization of issue fields would be helpful to get more meaningful charts, and to simplify interactions.
   * Can we inject into the Jira schema *new fields which relate to strategic planning and goals*, and use the utilities built-in to create scorecards?
