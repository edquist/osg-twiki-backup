<pre>
-- Working with Jim to collect as much information as possible on how to create and manage a VO.
   This is intended to be useful for new groups with no experience and no one with the needed expertise around them.
   We have identified some links, and I have tried to contact some experts.
   All we have by now is here [free format]:  

            https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Education/VOcreation


-- The students exchange program is progressing. I got good input from the 3 facilities: UoF, HMS, and GOC.
   I want to have all info from then in a few weeks and make a public announcement in Nov-Dec, before I leave for vacations.
   Current info can be found here

            https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Education/Exchange

   Will work with Ruth and Miriam (communications) for the official announcement. 

-- Possible OSG involvement in a Grid School in Ghana, August 2012.
   Still under discussion. We are still discussing the convenience of OSG getting involved in this activity.
   Horst Severini, Julia Gray (DOSAR) and myself had a meeting at CERN two weeks ago and talked about it.
   We agreed that is condor is removed from the curriculum, them is hard to justify OSG involvement.
   We were talking about logistics, potential number of students and background/profile, local technical support, etc.

   Plan:
     -- Discuss again during the next DOSAR meeting next week.
     -- If DOSAR finally goes for it, Horst Severini volunteered to present it during the next OSG council meeting.


-- Cleaning up the OSGEDU VO.
   Tim has asked to remove all non US OSG staffs members from the VO.
   I sent a message to osg-americas mailing list with an announcement.
   Colombians already have an Educational VO registered in OIM, so they don't need the OSG one. Brazilians will have one very soon [see next item]


-- Future activities in Brazil:

   -- People from Sao Paulo are in the process to apply for grants to their local funding agency to create a long term "Physics Instrumentation Program".
      Grid Computing is part of this project.
      I passed them the layout of our last proposal to NSF, as well as some generic neutral paragraphs, to help them to order the ideas for their own proposal.

   -- We have talked about the creation on a Brazilian Educational VO [see previous item]

   -- We have talked about setting up an OSG ITB at Sao Paulo, which would contribute to test the new RPM packages and so on, and let the locals to get expertise quite fast. Suchandra is quite happy with the idea too.


-- Future activities in Colombia:

   -- Colombia is doing well.
      They have two generic VOs (equivalent to OSG VO and OSGEDU VO) registered in OIM.
      Also ~10 sites are registered. They can be found here [several cities have two sites, so one need to zoom to see all of them]

              http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?map_attrs_shownr=on&all_sites=on&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on#6.489983,-75.761719|6|Terrain

   -- They are in the process of creating first real VO. It will focus on BioInformatics.
      If done, it will be the first single-purpose OSG VO outside US.
      To help them with this we would need to finish item 1.

---+++ 6.6 Assessment - Rob
   * I have begun looking at tools and data collected by the [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org][OSG Jira system]] as input to Assessment analysis
   * Two dashboards have been created: one for Software (including Gratia), the other for Operations. Both of these OSG communities seem to have taken to Jira, and the data collected there provides a window into those activities.
   * Of course the data is only a rough digitization of the true activity as not everything gets captured in the system, and being relatively new and without project-guidance & policy, there will be uneven interaction from the participants. 
   * Below is a portion of the Software Assessment dashboard <br /> %BR%
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_01.png" alt="screenshot_01.png" width='500' height='325' />    %BR% %BR%
   * which with the above caveat provides an interesting window into workload distribution among staff and others, eg. those with active tickets in Software currently:<br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_07.png" alt="screenshot_07.png" width='400' height='300' />    
   * Another is Created vs. Resolved issues which seems revealing: this gives an indication of the work backlog in Software, and the steady progress against it.  There are episodic changes in slope, but importantly the slopes of created and resolved tend to be the same meaning new work is being taken but not without old work getting resolved.
   * The changes in slope represent either productivity bursts or more difficult issues, especially in September. <br /> %BR%
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_04.png" alt="screenshot_04.png" width='400' height='300' />    %BR%
   * Compare same from the Operations Assessment dashboard: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/screenshot_06.png" alt="screenshot_06.png" width='400' height='300' />    %BR%
   * Impression that some customization of issue fields would be helpful to get more meaningful charts, and to simplify interactions.
   * Can we inject into the Jira schema *new fields which relate to strategic planning and goals*, and use the utilities built-in to create scorecards?
