---++ Communication, by Kyle Gross

---+++ Events
   1. VERITAS Article - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/veritas-and-open-science-grid-explore-extreme-window-into-the-universe/
   2. Molcryst Article - https://www.opensciencegrid.org/machine-learning-insights-into-molecular-science-using-the-open-science-grid/
   3. GRACC links added to OSG Website (About and Documentation pages)
   4. PEARC17 asked us to make a lot of announcements. We made a lot of announcements + tweets for them.
   5. Announced & Tweeted OSG User Support Training events
   6. Ongoing(?) - Series of announcements about OSG 3.4/Globus transitions

---+++ Concerns
   * Need more Research Highlight subject matter, though we have some direction. (!XENON1T, JLab)
   * We have cut effort for the writing of research highlights.  That task now falls to Rob and Kyle.
   * Lesser concern - Cleanup of FNAL mailing lists is tough. I've asked, but it is not always easy for me to become the admin any given mailing list. Though there is some progress. I will forge on.

---+++ Goals
   * Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.


---++ Operations, by Rob Quick
---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1. Configuration management at operations
      * All operations services (except !MyOSG) are under [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ansible_intro.md][Ansible]] based configuration management
         * !MyOSG is currently being added
      * Ansible files, "playbooks", etc. are, in turn, under SVN version control.
      * Ansible encapsulates all aspects of a service
         * VM specification, OS, RAM, CPU, /usr/local/, all service configuration and packages
      * Ansible is invoked by a master machine, not run by the target machine
      * It can update a running machine or build a new one
      * Handles development, ITB and production instances with a single playbook
         * ensures, to the extent possible, the testing instances are identical to the production instances
   1. TWiki retirement target dates:
      * To read only 1/Oct, !EoL ~31/Dec
      * Actively converting some documents (SLAs)
      * Switching other uses to !GitHub
   1. Will end Tuesday only maintenance with !TWiki retirement
      * Will still announce 1 week in advance, ITB instance will be available for testing.
   1. No updates planned during the first cycle of July due to holidays/vacations. 
      * 4/July was a Tuesday. Updates (and repairs) are possible if conditions require them
   1.  !PerfSonar reliability continues to be a concern.
      * Service is now in "Development" status, SLA is formally inoperative, done in consultation with the ET. 
      * During disk upgrade, existing data was corrupted. Service operators attempting recovery from local instances.
   1. Will propose a Service Management System for OSG
      * [[http://fitsm.itemo.org/][FitSM]] seems like a very good fit, lightweight but complete.
         * See, for example, the [[http://fitsm.itemo.org/fitsm/1][Requirements Document]]
      * Compare to ISO 20000, Other ITIL based instances.
      * Will need sign on by other service operators in OSG
   7. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond. 
      * Recent progress: ticket-dev is working, oim-dev is not.
 
---+++ Goals
   2. Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort.
      * Nearing completion, see above.
      * Automating rebuild via Ansible from backup (where appropriate) is in the pipe.


---++ Minutes

*Attendees:* Bala Desinghu, Brian Bockelman, Brian Lin, Ken Herner, Kyle Gross, Scott Teige, Shawn !McKee, Tim Cartwright, Zalak Shah

---+++ Calendar
Rob Quick will add a cybersecurity meeting that he and someone else are attending.

---+++ Communication
   * Recent accomplishments:
      * Published two research highlights&nbsp;&mdash; VERITAS and Molcryst
      * Added GR&Aring;CC links to the OSG website&nbsp;&mdash; but they are a little hard to find, so maybe it is worth adding something more prominent
      * Forwarded many announcements for PEARC17, the upcoming User Support & Campus Grids workshops, and the Globus situation
      * Rob&nbsp;Q. asked for help posting info about the !GridUNESP workshop
   * Goals (from above): Publish 12 Research Highlights, Update Web Images every two months, tweet 5-10 items per week.

---+++ Operations
   * Configuration management at IU now running almost entirely with Ansible; only !MyOSG is still being worked on. This change makes Operations more efficient, which should result in a greatly enhanced capacity to provide new services in the future (as needed, of course).

   * As &ldquo;central&rdquo; OSG services become increasingly decentralized, Rob would like to start looking into an IT Service Management System for all sites in OSG running OSG services. In particular, he is looking at !FitSM (Federated IT Service Management), which EGI uses, too. These tools describe systems, what they provide, and what to levels of service to expect; they are *not* about control of services. Rob plans to discuss this point at the planning retreat, and Tim&nbsp;C. and Brian&nbsp;B. recommended having at least some problems being solved and showing what it might look like for a user.

   * The TWiki retirement is still scheduled for 1 October to go to read-only status, and 31 December for decommissioning with archive of page sources. The main webs yet to be converted are !SoftwareTeam, Documentation, Management, and Operations. Tim&nbsp;C. asked for a concrete list of webs to be converted, their owners, and agreed-upon conversion dates.

   * Also at the start of October, Operations plans to end its practice of making service and infrastructure changes only on certain Tuesdays. Changes will occur at any time, within reason (i.e., not on Fridays or immediately preceding holidays) and will be announced at least one week in advance.

   * There are no Operations updates this cycle, due to the Fourth of July holiday.

   * perfSONAR reliability is still a concern and still in development status. Rob&nbsp;Q. wondered if things are still moving forward there. Shawn assured him that they are, saying that &ldquo;getting back to production is a goal.&ldquo; Brian&nbsp;B. asked whether the various services are different enough to promote back to production separately, but Shawn explained that they are hard to decouple.

   * Very early instances of the OSG Single Sign-On (SSO) services are running in test now, and sometimes work! There are still a variety of issues, though, and Marina is working on this project actively. Rob&nbsp;Q. hopes to show current progress at the planning retreat.

---+++ Concerns
   * Communication
      * Always need more Research Highlight ideas; Frank earlier suggested !XENON1T and JLab, and Scott suggested !GlueX
      * IU has cut effort for writing Research Highlights, so the main writing is now on Kyle and Rob&nbsp;Q. with editorial help from IU&nbsp;&mdash; this is both scary and exciting
      * Cleaning up the OSG mailing lists is hard, but getting better&nbsp;&mdash; Tim&nbsp;C. will help
   * Operations
      * Waiting to see how reduced effort works before committing to new long-term goals

---+++ Action items
None.
