---++ Operations, by Rob Quick
---+++ Key Accomplishments and Events
   1. Configuration management at operations
      * All operations services (except !MyOSG) are under [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/operations/blob/master/docs/ansible_intro.md][Ansible]] based configuration management
         * !MyOSG is currently being added
      * Ansible files, "playbooks", etc. are, in turn, under SVN version control.
      * Ansible encapsulates all aspects of a service
         * VM specification, OS, RAM, CPU, /usr/local/, all service configuration and packages
      * Ansible is invoked by a master machine, not run by the target machine
      * It can update a running machine or build a new one
      * Handles development, ITB and production instances with a single playbook
         * ensures, to the extent possible, the testing instances are identical to the production instances
   1. TWiki retirement dates:
      * To read only 1/Oct, !EoL ~31/Dec
      * Actively converting some documents (SLAs)
      * Switching other uses to !GitHub
   1. Will end Tuesday only maintenance with !TWiki retirement
      * Will still announce 1 week in advance, ITB instance will be available for testing.
   1. No updates planned during the first cycle of July due to holidays/vacations. 
      * 4/July was a Tuesday. Updates (and repairs) are possible if conditions require them
   1.  !PerfSonar reliability continues to be a concern.
      * Service is now in "Development" status, SLA is formally inoperative, done in consultation with the ET. 
      * During disk upgrade, existing data was corrupted. Service operators attempting recovery from local instances.
   1. Will propose a Service Management System for all of OSG
      * [[http://fitsm.itemo.org/][FitSM]] seems like a very good fit, lightweight but complete.
         * See, for example, the [[http://fitsm.itemo.org/fitsm/1][Requirements Document]]
      * Compare to ISO 20000, Other ITIL based instances.
      * Will need sign on by other service operators in OSG
   7. Research of SSO and CILogon 2.0 for authentication to Ops services and beyond. 
      * Recent progress: ticket-dev is working, oim-dev is not.
 
---+++ Goals
   2. Update configuration management and hardware resources that increase capacity with minimal long-term effort.
      * Nearing completion, see above.
      * Automating rebuild via Ansible from backup (where appropriate) is in the pipe.
