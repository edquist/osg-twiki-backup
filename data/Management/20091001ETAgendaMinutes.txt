---++ Software Tools Group Report
We're getting a fresh start on the new year. Over the summer, our meetings became less regular and we didn't have a good eye on our goals.

To address this, two weeks ago we had a planning meeting. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/Meeting20090922][Meeting minutes]] During this meaning, we came up with a list of topics that we need to address in the relatively near future. You can read the complete list there, but the list includes RSV, OIM, software licenses, storage discovery tool, announcing down times, and more.

Earlier this week, we had a detailed meeting about RSV. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/Meeting20090929][Meeting minutes]] Several topics were discussed, particularly the Marco's STG effort to develop a new user interface for RSV (called rsv-control). This is coming along well. Rob Quick and Arvind Gopu announced that they would like to transition development of the client portions of RSV (the stuff that isn't the probes or central collection) away from the GOC, so we've agreed to come up with a proposal for who should maintain this portion of RSV--it will be something we discuss in the short-term future (the next few days) with the Executive Team.

One of our short-term goals is to remedy a flaw in OSG development: Currently the VDT does not have a license for the code we wrote (like our configuration scripts--I'm not referring to the externally-developed software that we distribute). I am nearly ready to propose a license not only for the VDT, but for the software developed by OSG, so this will be discussed soon by the STG. We shouldn't have allowed ourselves to go so long without a clear license.
