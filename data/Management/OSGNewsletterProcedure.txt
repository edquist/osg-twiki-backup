---+!!OSG Newsletter
%TOC%

---++ Scope

The newsletter is to let people know specific things happening in OSG and to provide technical and practical information for readers, ie. what internet2 tools will be in VDT and when, what insight to using them is available and at what URL, etc...  Other parties are more than welcome to suggest idea's for upcoming articles.

Each technical brief should be no more than 100-120 words.

---++ Process

   * DR attends Area Coordinators meeting monthly and determines activities people are doing.  He makes a list of their responses with their names, and forwards to JL and AS. 

   * JL and AS press people for paragraphs about their activities. They receive paragraphs and may edit. They forward the result to MT  who may do further editing (semantics and content; articles that are very long or out of scope will be sent back to the author.)

   * MT will forward to JL or AS, who will put into html formatted e-mail, and forward to RP.  

   * JL or AS will send to EB for approval.



---++ Instructions on emailing newsletter via Thunderbird

It's always good to send a test message to yourself and maybe me if you want before you send it to osg.

1. Compose new mail message.

2. Select osgnews@opensciencegrid as the sender. Mail to osg@opensciencegrid.

3. Click in the "body" part of the message and

   A. from the menu, select "Insert" > "HTML" (a box will pop up for you to insert the HTML code)

   B. open the Dreamweaver code and select all

   C. paste the code in the box.

---++ Other Notes
(Marcia estimates this to be one (MT) to two (DR) days per cycle. Cycle
right now is once per month although noises have been made about twice a
month but a lot there depends on the willingness of the authors to write
technical briefs; Marcia will charge her activity on this to some OSG activity code.

Briefs are expected from those with the expertise in their area. Marcia will author briefs for VO Group, web site or other communications activities, but is not a regular contributor of content.
