---++ About This Document
The OSG coordinates with and leverages the work of many other projects that collaborate with OSG in different ways.  If these projects meet the criteria given in [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=913][OSG Interface to Satellite Proposals/Projects]], then they are deemed to be one of four types (1-4) of Satellite Projects of OSG.  Although each of these projects have a relationship with OSG, they are independently managed and run by the project PI. This document contains pointers to information on some of these projects.
