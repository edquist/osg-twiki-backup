---++ About This Document
The OSG coordinates with and leverages the work of many other projects that collaborate with OSG in different ways.  If these projects meet the criteria given in [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=913][OSG Interface to Satellite Proposals/Projects]], then they are deemed to be one of four types (1-4) of Satellite Projects of OSG.  Although each of these projects have a relationship with OSG, they are independently managed and run by the project PI. This document contains pointers to information on some of these projects.

---++ Type 1 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 1 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that plan to provide capabilities (including testing and certification) or services that will be made available to OSG stakeholders using the OSG infrastructure.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 1 Projects (their Leader) and Responsible OSG Executive Team Member:
   * [[Documentation.HighThroughputParallelComputing][HTPC]] aka Adopt-a-Cluster (Dan Fraser) - Miron Livny
   * [[http://newscenter.lbl.gov/press-releases/2009/08/10/esnet/][100 Gigabit]] Testing - Miron Livny
   * ExTENCI (Paul Avery) - Ruth Pordes

---++ Type 2 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 2 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that work to directly meet the needs of OSG stakeholders and the resulting work is expected to be “back ported” into the OSG infrastructure (e.g. software that becomes part of the VDT).

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 2 Projects and the Responsible OSG Liason:

---++ Type 3 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 3 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that work to directly meet the needs of OSG stakeholders and the resulting work is not expected to be “back ported” into the OSG infrastructure – typically this is extensions work that will become part of the stakeholders application software stack.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 3 Projects and their Leader:
   * [[http://pegasus.isi.edu/][Pegasus]] (Deelman)
   * [[http://www.cilogon.org/][CI Logon]] (Basney)
   * DISUN (Wuerthwein)


---++ Type 4 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 4 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that use OSG outputs for further research; they may provide intellectual feedback to OSG but do not substantially change the OSG infrastructure. These projects are generally expected to produce outputs for the funding agencies and other collaborations that have the potential for positive impact on OSG.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 4 Projects and their Leader:
   * [[http://conway2.isri.cmu.edu/scisoft-ecosystem-workshop/][VOSS]] (Herbsleb)
   * VOSS (Ribes)
