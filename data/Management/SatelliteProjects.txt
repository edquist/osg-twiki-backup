---++ About This Document
The OSG coordinates with and leverages the work of many other projects that collaborate with OSG in different ways.  These projects are Satellite Projects if they meet the following pre-requisites:
   1. OSG was involved in the planning process and there was communication and coordination between the proposal’s PI and OSG Executive Team before submission to agencies.
   1. OSG commits support for the proposal and/or future collaborative action within the OSG project.
   1. The project agrees to be considered an OSG Satellite project.

Satellite project are independent projects with their own project management, reporting, and accountability to their program sponsors; the OSG core project does not provide oversight for the execution of the satellite project’s work program.  This document defines the three types of Satellites, describes the OSG Interface with them, and contains pointers to information on these projects.

---++ Type 1 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 1 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that plan to provide capabilities (including testing and certification) or services that will be made available to OSG stakeholders using the OSG infrastructure.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Executive team, usually via the OSG project
manager, serves as the interface to these projects. We jointly document a short
synopsis of work goals, milestones and planned deliverables into OSG, expectations
from OSG, and current status/progress. This document is updated quarterly and
serves as the basis for joint quarterly (phone) meetings between the project and
OSG to understand issues and progress and refine goals; these meeting may
include the OSG area coordinators whose areas serve as the conduit for this project
to deliver via the OSG infrastructure. As appropriate, the OSG project manager will
include these milestones into the WBS so as to inform the rest of the OSG staff.
These projects are asked to contribute to the OSG annual report.

---++ Type 2 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 2 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that work to directly meet the needs of OSG stakeholders and
the resulting work is expected to be “included” in the OSG at some future time;
examples include software that becomes part of the VDT or testing and
characterization of grid capabilities that contribute to advancing the OSG
infrastructure and principles.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Executive team, usually via the OSG project
manager, serves as the interface to each of these projects. We jointly document a
short synopsis of goals, planned deliverables, expectations from OSG, and current
status/progress; the intent is to only cover the “touchpoints” between the satellite
project and the core OSG project. This document is updated quarterly and serves
as the basis of joint quarterly (phone) meetings between the satellite project and the
OSG to understand issues and progress. These projects are asked to contribute to
the OSG annual report.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 2 Projects and the Responsible OSG Liason:
   * [[ProjectHTPC][HTPC]] aka Adopt-a-Cluster (Dan Fraser) - Ruth Pordes
   * [[Extensions.AdvancedNetworkandDistributedStorageLaboratory][100 Gigabit]] Testing (Frank Wuerthwein) - Miron Livny

---++ Type 3 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 3 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that use OSG outputs for further research; they may provide
intellectual feedback to OSG but do not substantially change the OSG infrastructure
or directly impact the OSG stakeholders. These projects are generally expected to
produce outputs for the funding agencies and other collaborations that have the
potential for positive impact on OSG.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Council provides the mechanism for these projects
to keep the OSG community informed of their work; a quarterly or semi-­annual
update is encouraged.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 3 Projects and their Leader and OSG Liason:

These two projects are part of the NSF [[http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503256][VOSS (Virtual Organizations as Sociotechnical Systems) Program]]:
