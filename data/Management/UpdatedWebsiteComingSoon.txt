---++ Area Coodinator
The work execution tracking and reporting is conducted via weekly Area Coordinator meetings run by the project manager.  These meeting are attended by all area coordinators who provide peer review and input and help manage the inter-relationships between the different areas of work.  The ET is invited to attend for its information but this is primarily a forum for communication across the areas and information gathering by the project manager who then informs the ET of any issues and significant items.  
*Please view the Area Coordinators [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Management/AreaCoordinator][Meeting and Calendar]]*

---++ Work Planning & Tracking
The OSG Planning process includes a WBS with the high level tasks (deliverables and milestones). The WBS is maintained by the Project Manager and updated on a quarterly basis by the responsible person for each task area. 
Each Area Coordinator then maintains more detailed task and action lists and plans. These relate to the items in the WBS and are developed to a hierachy as appropriate. Area Coordinators work with the Project Manager to review their work  for consistency with the WBS.  The WBS is modified as needed to include any new work identified.
