---++ Minutes

*Attendees:* Brian Lin, Ken Herner, Kyle Gross, Mats Rynge, Rob Quick, Susan Sons, Tim Cartwright

---+++ Calendar (Tim Cartwright)
Rob Quick offered to add the OSG Council in-person meeting to the OSG calendar.

---+++ Monitoring Meeting (Rob Quick)
There was further discussion about settling on the logistics (attendees, timing, and location) of the monitoring planning meeting to follow the planning retreat.

---+++ Research Highlights (Kyle Gross)
The Molcryst article will be posted very soon.

---+++ User Support and Campus Grids (Mats Rynge)

| *Access Point* | *Users* | *Projects* | *Hours* | *Jobs* |
| OSG Connect |  95 |  50 |  19.1 M |  16.0 M |
| OSG Direct (XD + direct) |  21 |  14 |  12.9 M |  21.5 M |
| CI Connect (UChicago, Duke) |  79 |  31 |  8.0 M |  7.9 M |
| OSG Flocking |  19 |  16 |  5.1 M |  2.7 M |

   * Usage is steady, with 44.6 million total hours reported since April 1. Mats did a live demo via screen-sharing to show that GR&Aring;CC now has some dashboards to make reporting on these categories quick and easy. Overall, supply of resources is still constrained but not too bad&nbsp;&mdash; no immediate concerns here.

   * At the help desk, there was a noticeable uptick in new tickets, with 322 created and 308 resolved, still with high overall satisfaction rates. See next point for possible explanation of increase in ticket counts.

   * The team continues to strengthen new-user on-boarding, primarily by creating follow-up tickets when a new user joins. The ticket is closed immediately, but &ldquo;wakes up&rdquo; after a certain amount of time, causing the User Support folks to contact the new user again. Thus, they are now creating two tickets for every new user, instead of just one, thereby increasing the overall ticket counts. This system was just put into place, so they will report next time on effectiveness, effect on ticket metrics, etc. Also, they created a &ldquo;Facilitation in the OSG Context&rdquo; document.

   * Singularity is still being used. They have a pre-made container for running !TensorFlow jobs, but not with GPUs. The challenge is to create a !TensorFlow GPU container, which is hard because the drivers are very specific to the hardware. The Singularity team is working on a solution, but in the meantime the temporary workaround is to fill the container with all drivers and select the appropriate set at start-up time. Tim Cartwright noted that Wisconsin has at least one user for !TensorFlow GPU on OSG waiting and ready to go; Mats will let Tim know when they are ready for a pilot user.

   * At PEARC17, they will be doing the HTCondor Annex tutorial again. Things have improved considerably in HTCondor since the OSG AHM in March, and the tutorial will use the latest features from HTCondor 8.7.2. However, it still takes a fair amount of time to set up new users in the Amazon systems, and so (like for the AHM) they will be contacting users in advance to complete those steps before the tutorial. And there are some remaining issues with the Annex, and the HTCondor development team is working on them.

   * The South Pole Telescope (SPT) project is maturing, no major updates since the last report, they are just getting science done. The team needs to merge GR&Aring;CC records, which currently appear as two separate projects.

   * The !XENON1T project is maturing, too, with lots of usage. The data-to-CPU ratio is quite high, so they have been working on finding an optimal data-handling approach. They have settled on using dCache storage at UChicago. Also, they have added the ability to submit from OSG infrastructure into EGI, which is good. Usage was about 2.5 million hours, 1.3 million hours of which came from Comet.

   * The US&CG team will be presenting workshops at PEARC17 (two tutorials), RMACC (same as PEARC), and the IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 2017) in November.

---+++ Concerns
   * Understanding why so many new users drop off is key.
   * Otherwise, things are going well.

---+++ Action items
   * [DONE] Tim C. will reserve UW&ndash;Madison Computer Sciences room 4259 for the morning of July 27 (Thursday) for the monitoring planning meeting.
