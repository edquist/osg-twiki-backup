---++ Software - Tim Cartwright

---+++ Recent Accomplishments

Since 29 May 2013 — last presentation was focused on Year 2 plans.

   * Contributed to four releases: [[Documentation.Release3.Release3119][3.1.19]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3120][3.1.20]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3121][3.1.21]], [[Documentation.Release3.Release3122][3.1.22]]
      * CA certificate updates
      * CVMFS 2.0.19 &ndash; 2.1.14
      * GlideinWMS 2.7.1
      * HDFS 2.0
      * HTCondor 7.9.6 &ndash; 8.0.0
      * HTCondor-CE support nearly complete (in testing)
      * Java 7 packages in Upcoming production, just moved to 3.1 testing
      * SHA-2 updates complete
      * SLURM supported as a resource management system
      * VO package updates
      * Myriad bug fixes and small improvements!

   * Most sites have deployed OSG 3.1

   * Started work on “OSG Next” &mdash; support for future release series (e.g., 3.2, 3.3, 4.0, &hellip;)

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * WBS 1.x: Ongoing

   * [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][WBS 2.1: Transition from Oracle Java 6 to !OpenJDK 7]]
      * Going very well, expect to be complete with next release (Tuesday!)

   * WBS 2.2: Add support for SLURM resource management system
      * Essentially done, except for Gratia configuration support (coming Tuesday, I think)

   * [[SoftwareTeam.SP021_NewVersions][WBS 2.3: Prepare for OSG 3.2 and beyond (aka “OSG Next”)]]
      * In progress now
      * Coding, testing, deployments, etc., scheduled now through 22 October
      * Aiming for a 3.2.0 release on 12 November

   * WBS 2.4: Merge in latest Globus Toolkit changes, including upstreamed patches
   * WBS 4.1: Move Globus patches upstream
      * Waiting for Globus Toolkit 5.2.5 release (imminent)
      * Then will update patches and contribute to Globus
      * Globus Toolkit 5.2.6 may be based mostly on our patches

   * WBS 5.1: Simplify test development by improving test framework
      * Added ability to read configuration file (helps with tests-as-jobs and environment tweaking)
      * Will add dynamically generated CA, host, and user certificates (can run in more environments)
      * Will rewrite sequencing engine, express tests as DAG, and randomize topological sort (more diversity)

   * WBS 5.2: Run tests as normal jobs locally and perhaps in OSG
      * Have run osg-test as a VM universe job in CHTC, but still have a few failures
      * Need to expand set of available base OS images (to current 6)
      * Plan is to replace current tests with VM universe-based ones in next 6 months or so
      * *MANY* technical challenges and hurdles to make this all work!

   * WBS 6.1: 2013 OSG User School
      * Submitted one part of 2012 final report, waiting for Indiana on other part
      * Wrapping up finances and final assignments from 2013 School
      * Planning follow-ups, in terms of a survey or two, plus mentoring duties
      * Starting to think about using (the dreaded?) social media to help promote and communicate

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Past:* Defining Technology, Software, and Release Teams
      * Seems to be going well
      * Still working on hiring and staff duties at some institutions

   * *Past:* Multiple Important Projects
      * Seem to be juggling many projects at once fairly well
      * Number of simultaneous, high-priority projects going down (phew!)

   * *Past:* Slowed or Delayed Projects
      * Many projects carried over to Year 2, on track to reach most/all of them

   * *Tracking Upstream Changes*
      * Example: Still had condor-7.8.6 long after 7.8.8 had been released
      * We package so many upstream components, that it is very difficult to track changes to all of them
      * Nominally assigned to the Release team now, but it is a big task
      * Need to work with !BrianB and !TimT to come up with a real plan here


---+++  Tim Theisen - Release
---+++ Recent Accomplishments

   * *Releases*
      * Since last Software report
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3119][3.1.19]]: gratia-probe fix; CVMFS 2.0.19; GlideinWMS 2.7.1; client tarball fixes; HTCondor 7.9.6 in upcoming 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3120][3.1.20]]: Update CA certificates 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3121][3.1.21]]: Update CA certificates and VO data; Upcoming: OpenJDK 7, HDFS 2, HTCondor 8.0.0 
         * [[Documentation.Release3.Release3122][3.1.22]]: CVMFS 2.1.14, VO package v46, RSV/osg-configure improvement/bug fixes, SLURM, dCache-SRMClient; Upcoming: OpenJDK7

   * Established predictable release schedule
      * Aligns with GOC schedule
      * Unexpected Benefit: Software Team has specific time to work on futures
      * Aiming for about one per month, but will do interim releases (e.g., 3.1.20) as appropriate

   * Record of testing performed in the JIRA ticket

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * ITB instance in Madison
      * Be better able to test the system as a whole
      * Much closer to the user experience

   * Collect Standard Test Cases
      * Repeatability of Testing
      * Able to hand components to new testers

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Difficult to Get Early Adopters*
      * Multiple Solicitations needed
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs
      * Perhaps, some (not all) people that scream for something are not willing to test?

   * *Finding appropriate testers*
      * Have had luck working the personal network to find helpful individuals
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs

   * Still Learning
