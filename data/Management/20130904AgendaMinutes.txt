   * Record of testing performed in the JIRA ticket

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * ITB instance in Madison
      * Be better able to test the system as a whole
      * Much closer to the user experience

   * Collect Standard Test Cases
      * Repeatability of Testing
      * Able to hand components to new testers

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Difficult to Get Early Adopters*
      * Multiple Solicitations needed
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs
      * Perhaps, some (not all) people that scream for something are not willing to test?

   * *Finding appropriate testers*
      * Have had luck working the personal network to find helpful individuals
      * Their time schedule does not align with testing needs

   * Still Learning
