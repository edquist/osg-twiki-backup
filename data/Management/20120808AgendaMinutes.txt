---++ Software - Alain Roy

(This is just an outline, not fully fleshed out yet)

---+++ Key Initiatives

   * *Support ongoing deployment of OSG Software 3 (RPMs)*
   * *SHA-2 transition*
      * I had let work on the SHA-2 slide a bit due to a misunderstanding of the deadline. Current understanding:
         * CAs may transition as early as January 2012
         * WLCG is looking for a way to delay the need to fully transition deployed software by then (extra CA? Convince IGTF CA's to continue using SHA1?)
         * Bestman2: Area of biggest concern. Neha owns it and is focusing her effort on conversion to jGlobus 2. 
   * *Support DigiCert transition*
      * Packaging of the CA certs
      * Helping with evaluation of software acceptance
   * *Upgrade HDFS*
      * Major upgrade for CMS
      * Owned by Doug Strain
      * Good progress--initial test version complete, sorting through issues

---+++ Top Concerns

   * *Globus problems within ATLAS* _Description here_
   * 

---+++ Recent accomplishments

   * Two software releases in July, [[Documentation.Release3.Release316][3.1.6] & [[Documentation.Release3.Release317][3.1.7]]
      * Bug fixes (RSV, Xrootd/LCMAPS integration, HDFS, Bestman2)
      * Improved Bestman2 handling
      * Enhanced Condor GRAM job manager
      * Other miscellaneous
   * Support for CREAM 2 evaluation by Technology team
      * Fully packaged and working CREAM client tools
      * Fully packaged and mostly working CREAM server: still solving issues in submitting jobs
