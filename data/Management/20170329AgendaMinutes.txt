---++ Minutes

*Attendees:* Bala Desinghu, Brian Bockelman, Brian Lin, Ken Herner, Tim Cartwright, Tim Theisen, Shawn !McKee

---+++ Production Support
   * All pilot hours (not just opportunistic) have been fairly steady with the LHC experiments taking about 75% as usual.
   * Opportunistic contributions are similar to the recent past, with Syracuse, FNAL, MWT2, and Caltech taking the top four spots. We did briefly exceed 40K OSG flocking jobs, which was the first time in months that that occurred.
   * Looking at hours by projects, there has been a steady climb since the start of the (calendar) year. The top three users were SPLINTER, S. Bass, and D. Krieger (although Don may have actually won if some separate accounting lines were merged into his).
   * Generally, after seeing in downturn in opportunistic hours from October through December, we are now seeing more opportunistic availability. Nonetheless, OSG needs to keep growing the opportunistic resource pool.
   * And speaking of, some new resources are coming online. JINR (!NOvA and STAR) has a new CE, and it has been steady in production for a few weeks now. Ken had been trying to get more VOs to run at Utah, Puerto Rico, and Ole Miss, but low demand from the VOs has pushed this off for now. As for GPU resources, Tusker (HCC) now has some nodes on OSG, BNL has about 200 non-ATLAS GPUs, Stanford is working on it, and Syracuse has some (with priority to their own campus users for now, then hopefully an expansion to OSG).
   * Other VO updates:
      * US-LHC still making good use of opportunistic resources
      * !NOvA starting to ramp up
      * !StashCache &mdash; Microboone and Mu2e are populating their !StashCache/CVMFS areas
      * LSST has redeployed a submit node at Purdue and will flock to OSG
      * DUNE is getting cycles pledged from EGI
      * !GlueX ramping up again, going the Hosted CE route

---+++ Concerns
   * Resources are looking better now than the last few months of 2016, but there will be more LHC rushes, so OSG must keep adding resources (esp. Hosted CE).
   * There is some concern about EL&nbsp;7 worker nodes, but containers will mitigate things.

---+++ Action items
None this time.
