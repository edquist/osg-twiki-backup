---++ ATLAS Offer of Resources
From Razvan 8/30/06:  
USATLAS will use less computing resources during approximately next 2 weeks, potentially leaving idle cycles. It would be a good opportunity to provide OSG support. Internally, we?ve alerted our personnel that they should make sure the OSG access is functional, but we would also like to make you aware of this opportunity. I fear that the recent limited amount of resources available to OSG might have discouraged work submission to USATLAS sites. An encouragement might be useful. J
 Could you help us distribute this information?
 Thanks,
Razvan
