---++ About This Document
The OSG coordinates with and leverages the work of many other projects that collaborate with OSG in different ways.  These projects are Satellite Projects if these projects meet the following pre-requisites:
   * OSG was involved in the planning process and there was communication and coordination between the proposal’s PI and OSG Executive Team before submission to agencies
   * OSG commits support for the proposal and/or future collaborative action within the OSG project
OSG Satellite Projects fall into four types (1-4).  Although each of these projects have a relationship with OSG, they are independently managed and run by the project PI. This document defines the four types of Satellites, describes the OSG Interface with them, and contains pointers to information on these projects.

---++ Type 1 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 1 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that plan to provide capabilities (including testing and certification) or services that will be made available to OSG stakeholders using the OSG infrastructure.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Executive team serve as the interface to these projects. We jointly document a short (~3 pages) synopsis of work goals, milestones and planned deliverables into OSG, current status/progress.	This document is updated at least quarterly and serves as the basis for joint quarterly (phone) meetings between the project and OSG to understand issues and progress and refine goals; these meeting will include the OSG area coordinators whose areas serve as the conduit for this project to deliver via the OSG infrastructure. These projects are asked to contribute to the OSG annual report.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 1 Projects (their Leader) and Responsible OSG Executive Team Member:
   * [[Documentation.HighThroughputParallelComputing][HTPC]] aka Adopt-a-Cluster (Dan Fraser) - Miron Livny
   * [[Extensions.AdvancedNetworkandDistributedStorageLaboratory][100 Gigabit]] Testing (Frank Wuerthwein) - Miron Livny
   * ExTENCI (Paul Avery) - Ruth Pordes

---++ Type 2 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 2 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that work to directly meet the needs of OSG stakeholders and the resulting work is expected to be “back ported” into the OSG infrastructure (e.g. software that becomes part of the VDT).

---+++ Interface
The OSG Executive team will appoint a project liaison who serves as the OSG interface to each of these projects. We jointly document a short (~3 pages) synopsis of work goals, milestones and planned deliverables into OSG, current status/progress; the intent is to only cover the milestones that represent completion points from which the “back port” into OSG can commence.	This document is updated at least quarterly and serves as the basis of joint quarterly (phone) meetings between the project and OSG liaison to understand issues and progress; these meeting will include the OSG area coordinators whose areas will be affected by the “back porting” work. These projects are asked to contribute to the OSG annual report.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 2 Projects and the Responsible OSG Liason:

   * DISUN (Wuerthwein)

---++ Type 3 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 3 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that work to directly meet the needs of OSG stakeholders and the resulting work is not expected to be “back ported” into the OSG infrastructure – typically this is extensions work that will become part of the stakeholders application software stack.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Council provides the mechanism for these projects to keep the OSG community informed of their work; a quarterly update and active presence at the OSG Consortium All Hands meeting is encouraged. These projects are asked to contribute to the OSG annual report.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 3 Projects,(their Leader) and OSG Contact:
   * [[http://pegasus.isi.edu/][Pegasus]] (Deelman)
   * [[http://www.cilogon.org/][CI Logon]] (Basney) - Mine Altunay

---++ Type 4 Satellite Projects

---+++ Definition
Type 4 Satellite Projects are defined as Projects that use OSG outputs for further research; they may provide intellectual feedback to OSG but do not substantially change the OSG infrastructure. These projects are generally expected to produce outputs for the funding agencies and other collaborations that have the potential for positive impact on OSG.

---+++ Interface
The OSG Council provides the mechanism for these projects to keep the OSG community informed of their work; a quarterly update is encouraged.

---+++ Projects
The following is a list of Type 4 Projects and their Leader:
   * [[http://conway2.isri.cmu.edu/scisoft-ecosystem-workshop/][VOSS]] (Jim Herbsleb, Carnegie Mellon)
   * VOSS (Ribes)
