---++++ Top Concerns
   1 !DigiCert Transition
      * Effort Concerns - Both Soichi and Alain have put much more than budgeted effort into this. 
         * While the number of requests to approve will be approximately equal to previous years with DOEGrids, we own a lot more of the process (administration, ticketing, front end and documentation). 
      * Requested changes to SLA for notification. 
   2 OASIS Service
      * SLA under construction
      * Training session for AHM
   3 Training Sessions
      * We've decided on the next 2 sessions but scheduling has been difficult
         * Intro to HTC - Using a subset of the grid-school content (Starting Early/Mid October)
            * Pushed to after AHM
         * Networking - Jason from I2 need the perfSONAR infrastructure to be in place to do this right (Early 2013)
   4 Effort for AHM Planning
      * This is eating up much more effort than anticipated. 
   5 Other effort concerns
      * Recent maternity leave has put stress on the support group. 
      * Also having to deal with other time off issues (medical, bereavement, etc)
      * We're not getting behind, but we're struggling to keep up. 

---++++ Recent Activities
   1 PKI Front End and RA Activities
      * Released on January 30th
      * Documentation for PKI Users and Admins completed
   2 OIM/MyOSG Support of Campus Grids
   3 New hardware acquired to host OASIS and provide "elbow room" for other services
   4 CILogin Basic in Production - Active Dec 11th
   5 Human Computer Interaction Review
      * Do we have a mechanism for student interns? I'd like to get a grad student from the Informatics HCI program to review OSG services.
