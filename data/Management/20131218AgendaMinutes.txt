---++ Discussion on Transition of Network Monitoring Dashboard

The  main  challenge  is  the  we no  longer  have  a  functional dashboard for  most  of our  OSG  or  WLCG  sites.  The  instances  at  BNL  are not properly  running  and  can't  be  resurrected.   Soichi  has  some  older  version implemented  in  OSG (from  code  around  last  May) but  it  misses much  of  what  is  needed for our  use.   

We  need  to  be  able  to:   
   *  Read in  mesh-configurations and  properly collect  and  display data from the  relevant  sites.     
   *  Process OWAMP, !PingER,  BWCTL and  Traceroute  tests
   *  Provide network  data to  users  and  applications  to  enable  them  to  make  decisions where applicable
   *  Scale  to  monitoring and  collecting  data from 150-200  sites  (OSG+WLCG)

---+++  Topics  for  discussion
   * How did meetings go between Tom & Soichi?  
   * Current  dashboard code  is  in !GitHub  at  https://github.com/PerfModDash/PerfModDash    Tom  felt the  'dashboard3'  code  using  the  'Spring'  framework  was  the  right  way to  go  if  someone could  be  found  to take  over.
   * Involvement of *software* and/or  *technology* team?
   * Interim  (or  long-term)  use  of  !MadDash?      ESnet has  developed !MadDash as  their  dashboard.   You can  see  some  examples  at :
      *  ESnet  to  Large sites:  http://ps-dashboard.es.net/index.cgi?dashboard=4%3A%20ESnet%20to%20Large%20Facilities
      *  Example of  service monitoring:   http://ps-dashboard.es.net/index.cgi?dashboard=9%3A%20ESnet%20Port%20Checks

   * Next steps
