   * [[%ATTACHURL%/2015_OSG_Annual_Report.pdf][OSG Annual Report inputs are due Feb 11]]

---++ Security - Mine Altunay
   * Last report was on Dec 10. 
   * CIlogon HSM project
      * The MOU between XSEDE and OSG is signed. The project planning started right away in January. We want to start the transition process in January 2016. A project plan is developed and ready for ET review.  I attached a copy here for your review. [[%ATTACHURL%/OSGCA_ProjectPlanv0.2.pdf][OSG CA ProjectPlan v0.2 pdf ]]We are working on sub plans such as development plan, acceptance test plan, communication plan, and so on. Our goal is to finish the planning phase by end of February. 
   * HTCondor CE drill. Fully completed. We asked to repeat this because we wanted to do a more comprehensive testing. We are satisfied with the results and this is completed. 
   * OSG risk assessment and results of Security Controls were published. 
   * Started working on Traceability project. When we first made the transition to the certificate-free jobs, we also identified some risks but we decided to handle them later. Now that we are at a smooth point in the project, we need to start addressing these risks and mitigate them. As a first step, we ran somewhat more aggressive jobs that they were not malicious but tried doing things that an attacker would want to do. Our goal was to find out how easy to pull this off. For some risks, we found out that it was very simple therefore we must achieve a mitigation system. Currently, we are writing down the mitigation techniques.
