---+ TEG Updates

[[DecFirst][Previous update]].  Mostly a quiet month due to holidays.

Data, Storage, Security, Operations, and Workload Management will be having face-to-face meetings at NIKHEF on the week of January 22nd.  Perhaps the calm before the storm?

Below, the asterisk (*) indicates the person who sent the update.

There's really not been any change since the beginning of December.
I think everybody has been thinking it wasn't urgent enough to do before
the holidays and are waiting to get it done this month.


---++ Data Management
(Brian Bockelman*)

Items of note:
   * Data and Storage continue to have joint meetings; the TEG week activities will also be joint (Indico link: https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=165687), primarily due to the overlap of people.
   * In January, ATLAS gave their presentation about their experimental needs, use cases, and plans.
   * The other LHC experiments presented in 2011.  We now have a complete picture of the various experiment use cases.
   * I expect to have a strong document about experiment needs at the end of January; more than that will be optimistic.  I believe the middleware providers will have increased input starting at the face-to-face meeting, and maybe not have a formal presentation.
   * Interesting anecdotes:
      * The LFC use cases seem to be getting smaller, in favor of experiment-specific solutions.  LHCb is the only one who heavily uses its features.
      * We're starting to enumerate the various use cases of SRM, deciding which parts are heavily used, which have replacements, and which are unique to SRM.
