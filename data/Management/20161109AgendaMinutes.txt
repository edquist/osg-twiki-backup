Key Initiatives
   1. StashCache used by production users at up to 200TB / week: flux files by NOvA; stashcp by Clenmson group (OSG VO).
   2. Singularity - container for user isolation and environment portability on batch systems. Discovered kernel bug on RHEL 6; focusing adoption on RHEL 7.
   3. SRM Retirement : CMS T2 accelerating; Atlas slow progress.

Top Issues / Concerns
   1. GRACC - smooth operations, but no historical summary data yet. Converting Gratia users to GRACC. Conversion to GRACC APIs behind target
   2. BDII retirement - Progress on Atlas switching to the OSG Collector. Promoting new version of the collector publishing AGIS-compatible JSON schema to production shortly.
   3. Maintaining fair-share between LIGO and OSG VO on opportunistic sites

Key Accomplishments
   1. LIGO is ramping up - Peak usage at 20k cores. Porting additional pipelines. Preferred platform is RHEL7 over 6.
