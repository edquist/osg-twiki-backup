   * Step 2:Look under ”Information to Display” then select “Resource Service Counts”.  
   * Step 3:Next, select “Show Total Resource Count” and  last update page. 
This will give you the information for the Production and ITB Resource for the charts.

   * Step 2:Click “Virtual Organizations”
   * Step 3:Select Filter – Check marking on the active VO’s
