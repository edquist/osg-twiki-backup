It is with sadness that we are reporting the departure of Alain Roy and Scot Kronenfeld from the OSG Software Team. Many of you have benefited from Alain’s leadership of and many contributions to the Virtual Data Toolkit, the Software Area and the Software Toolkit Group over the past several years. We can all attest to the excellence of his technical  skills, his infinite patience and courtesy, and his commitment and engagement across the vision and practicalities of the OSG’s support for science and research. 
    
We wish Alain all the very best as he moves to a software development position in Washington State to be near the rest of his extended family. We are preparing one of the “OSG plaques” and will be sending him this at his new address in the next couple of weeks.

We also note the departure of another key, important member of the OSG software team at Wisconsin – Scot Kronenfeld. As he moves onto new responsibilities at the university, we wish him all the best and thank him for sterling and committed service to the OSG program of work. 

We wish  bonne chance to them both.

Please welcome Tim Cartwright in his new role as the interim Software Area Lead, replacing Alain Roy for the next few months. Tim has extensive experience as part of the OSG Software Area, and has already started in his new role with Alain’s departure.

---++++_Welcoming Von Welch into the OSG staff fold_

You have seen many recent reports from Von in his role as lead  of the PKI Transition Project to move us to OSG supplied PKI services.  We are very pleased that he is also contributing as we move forward to the OSG project – as part of the Indiana University team – most likely in areas of identity management and security.

I would like to draw your attention to 3 new OSG Council sub-committees that I am facilitating to help move the OSG Consortium forward over the next years to success. 
These cover:

a) Consortium and Council member representation, organization, and responsibilities. 

b) OSG and industry – goals, scope, ideas. 

c) Sustaining the OSG past the next few years.  

Several members of the Council are stepping up to contribute to these committees. My goal is to be able to report back to the Council by the end of this calendar year on these activities.

~ Ruth Pordes, OSG Council Chair
