---+ In the OSG, what is a Virtual Organization?

A Virtual Organization (VO) is an organization typified by, though certainly not limited to, scientific research collaborations .  The features of these types of collaborations that distinguish them as VOs are that their members:
   * work toward a common goal or set of goals 
   * share computing and/or data storage resources in pursuit of these goals 
   * span institutional and regional boundaries 
   * may join and/or disassociate over the lifetime of the organization, as may institutions
The VO is governed by a set of rules that define the resources that are shared, who is allowed to share them, and the conditions under which sharing occurs.  As defined in the 
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18][OSG Blueprint]],
a VO in OSG can include users, resources, and services.

<!--
Users of the Open Science Grid (OSG) are required to band together
into VOs, since in OSG, all support for users comes from the VO. Each VO includes at least one organization that's a member or partner of the OSG Consortium. %RED%Previous sentence needs clarification.%ENDCOLOR%  OSG 
supports individual researchers by asking them to join the VO named, confusingly "OSG".
OSG operates much as a "wholesaler" network, and VOs are expected to
provide the "retailer" functions to their users (user help, debugging
assistance, etc.). There is a VO called "OSG" for groups
lacking the wherewithal for a VO management infrastructure.

For more information on the VOs in OSG, see the 
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=83][current list of OSG VOs]].

If you are associated with a VO listed there, feel free to contact its
support center for further information or assistance. If you are not, and would like
to form your own VO, consult the 
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82][VO Formation page]].
