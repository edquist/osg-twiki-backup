---+ In the OSG, what is a Virtual Organization?

A Virtual Organization (VO) is an organization typified by scientific research collaborations, though not limited to this type of organization.  A VO is an organization in which members:
   * work toward a common goal or set of goals 
   * share resources in pursuit of these goals 
   * span institutional and regional boundaries 
   * come and go over time, as do institutions
The VO is governed by a set of rules that define the resources that are shared, who is allowed to share them, and the conditions under which sharing occurs. 

Users of the Open Science Grid (OSG) are required to band together
into VOs, since in OSG, all support for users comes from the VO. Each VO includes at least one organization that's a member or partner of the OSG Consortium. Thus OSG does not currently
support individual researchers, but instead supports groups of
participants able and willing to contribute to OSG.

As defined in the 
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18][OSG Blueprint]],
a VO can include users, resources, and services. For more information,
see the 
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=83][current list of OSG VOs]].

If you are associated with a VO listed there, please contact its
support center for further assistance. If you are not, and would like
to form your own VO, consult the 
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=86&Itemid=82][VO Formation page]].

OSG operates much as a "wholesaler" network, and VOs are expected to
provide the "retailer" functions to their users (user help, debugging
assistance, etc.). In the future there may be an OSG VO for groups
lacking the wherewithal for a VO management infrastructure; however,
at this time, none of the consortium participants is able to provide
this service.
