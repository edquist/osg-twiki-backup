---+ In the OSG, what is a Virtual Organization?
%STARTINCLUDE%
There is an [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000068][introductory paragraph about VOs]] in the main OSG website. We'll expand on that here.

Current grid development projects, OSG included, are being designed such that they require end users to be authenticated under the auspices of a "recognized" organization, called a Virtual Organization, or VO. Individuals with no recognized affiliation are not generally allowed to use grid resources. Members of a VO may come from many different home institutions, may have in common only a general interest or goal (e.g., CMS physics analysis), and may communicate and coordinate their work solely through information technology (hence the term virtual). In addition, individual members and/or institutions may join and leave the organization over time; sometimes VOs are called _dynamic virtual organizations_ for this reason. Any (traditional) organization that aspires to authorize its members to use grid resources must create a VO for itself.

A VO must establish resource-usage agreements with grid resource providers; in fact from the authorization point of view (i.e., ignoring the technology involved), a grid is essentially the result of enforcing agreements between distributed computing resource providers and VOs.

Maintaining security within a grid is very important. Each VO must control which individuals join it, and be able to verify their identities and institutional affiliations (i.e., it must enforce authentication). The VO is responsible for authenticating its members, authorizing them for grid computing privileges, and it must make its list of authorized members available to the software that controls and monitors the grid resources. The individual sites and resources typically enforce additional layers of authorization.

A VO may implement a complex structure of groups and subgroups in order to organize and manage its members according to their tasks and responsibilities.
