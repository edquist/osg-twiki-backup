---OSG Resource Allocation

%STARTINCLUDE%

---+ Resource Usage on OSG

%TOC%
---++  Overview

Resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by members of the Consortium. To use resources through the OSG infrastructure a user must be a member of
a Virtual Organization(VO).  The owners of the resources,  VOs and IT organizations  (universities, national labs or commercial (cloud) computing vendors),  fully control access to and usage policies on their resources. Through membership in the OSG owners share their resources, governed by their policy. 


Many resource owners allow other members of the OSG to use their resources. Membership in OSG implies a willingness to share and to make otherwise unused resources automatically available for others to use.  This is part of the "economic model" of OSG for providing benefit across the organization. 

The most common policy for resource utilization outside the owning VO is "opportunistic use". The interpretation of this varies across the OSG. Some owners allow access to all their "spare" resources to any registered VO. Others provide  priority to "their friend VOs" or enable only a small subset of resources and/or VOs. 

Currently, OSG has no automated mechanisms for determining policy. Sites are required to document their policy on a web page which is registered to the OSG Information Management system and available through an [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/pub/resource/show.php][operations web page]] (you need a  certificate from an OSG recognised CA  in your web browser to access this information).


---++Request for  Scheduled Production Runs

From time to time VOs wish to make use of the OSG for scheduled production runs that need throughput greater than the sum of the resources they own and that  available in practice to them opportunistically. Alternatively, or additionally, the VO may be looking for some "guaranteed expectations" in terms of throughput (e.g. number of successful jobs/day) and/or resource use (e.g. leasing storage for a long perion). 
 

Such requests are brought to the attention of the OSG Council (by the VO or  a member of the OSG Executive Team) and  a “Service Description” of resource contributions, throughput and service expectations agreed to. The requesting VO makes a presentation at an OSG Council meeting detailing the amount and duration of cpu, storage, and other services needed, as well as particular needs and constraints of the applications being used.  

OSG Council members, as well as other members of OSG as facilitated by the OSG Executive Team, agree to a commitment of resources with a goal to meet the VOs production needs.  This is recorded by an informal agreement between the OSG Council and the management of the requesting VO.

Usage related to the production is tracked by the OSG accounting system; Successful throughput (ie end-to-end benefit) is tracked by the VO. Reports are archived. The completion of the production run (or phases of production) are similarly noted.

Individuals are identified (and recorded) within OSG and the VO with responsibility to track, report, review and identify  issues related to the production request . Within OSG:

   * For “at large VOs” - OSG VO Group Coordinators.
   * For production requests from OSG owned VOs (currently Engage, OSGEDU, OSG) - the VO Coordinators (members of the OSG staff). 
   * For US ATLAS, US CMS, LIGO – the OSG major account manager.
 

----++ Resource Allocations Owned by the OSG
The OSG itself may received allocations from resource owners. These are owned by the OSG Executive Director who works with the OSG staff as listed above to ensure appropriate and timely use. These allocations are listed [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/OSGResourceAllocations ][here]].
