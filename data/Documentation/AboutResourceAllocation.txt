The OSG does not allocate resources, as none of the resources available via the grid are "owned" by the OSG. The owners &#8212; generally large VOs and IT organizations, including national labs &#8212; fully control usage policies on their resources. 

Many VOs allow you to use resources beyond those owned by the VO. The most common policy for resource utilization outside your own VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is "opportunistic use". The interpretation of this varies greatly. Some sites allow access to all their "spare" resources to anybody registered with a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo on OSG, others to only a small subset of resources and/or VOs. Some sites interpret "spare" to mean "until a more privileged user arrives", others guarantee a minimum wall clock time for your job once it starts.

Currently, OSG has not defined a policy schema so you can't query a database to determine a site's specific policies. Check the site's policy web page.  The only reliable way to find out policy is to try to run a job.
