#InTro
---++Introduction
The Documentation TWiki Web serves as central hub of OSG community-developed documentation for OSG resource users and administrators.  You may need to start at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000059][Getting Started]] to learn about the different ways to participate in OSG.
No matter what your role in OSG, you'll need to at least do the following things to participate in OSG:
#FaQ
---++ Frequently Asked Questions
OSG started to develop a knowledge base, and for various reasons has chosen to abandon it. However, much of the information we collected is very useful.  It has been largely turned into twiki topics and linked into the documentation as appropriate. We present the topics also in the form of a FAQ in case you find that easier.  See [[OsgFaq][The OSG FAQ]].  %RED%FAQ is under construction as of early Apr 07%ENDCOLOR%

#UserDoc
---++ End-User Documentation
How an end-user runs a VO-specific application is determined by the user's VO, often by the VO's application administrator.  Beyond the information presented in  [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000059][Getting Started]] and some general information here, we can only point you to your VO for documentation on submitting jobs to OSG resources.  We provide an area under [[VO/WebHome]] for VOs to provide and/or links to their documentation.  

Go to [[VO/WebHome]] and look up your VO in the left-hand column of the table.  Across the row, you should find various categories of information pertaining to your VO, e.g., User Info, Application, Success/Failure, and so on.  If not, please contact your [[SupportCenters][VO support center]].

#AdminDoc

---++ Administrator Documentation
If you've done your administrative task before, you might prefer to use the appropriate [[#AdminQuick][quick link]] below. In general, we recommend that you read the [[#AdminDetail][Detailed Documentation by Admin Role]] page that corresponds to the admin task you're charged with. Each of these pages includes links to background information, support information, best practices, and other helpful tidbits.
