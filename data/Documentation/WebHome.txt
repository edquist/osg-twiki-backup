#InTro
---++Introduction
The Documentation TWiki Web serves as a home for OSG community-developed documentation for OSG resource users and administrators, 
No matter what your role in OSG, you'll need to at least do the following things to participate in OSG:

#UserDoc
---++ User Documentation
   * [[UserDocEndUser][End User (Computing)]] (Quick link to [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][CE Client Install Guide]] for those who have done it before.)
   * [[UserDocStorageUser][End User (Storage)]]
   * [[UserDocNovice][Novice]]
   * [[UserDocEdu][Student or Educator]]
*Most people can stop here!  The information below is for resource and service administrators, not for end users.*
#AdminDoc

---++ Administrator Documentation
If you've done your administrative task before, you might prefer to use the appropriate [[#AdminQuick][quick link]] below. In general, we recommend that you read the [[#AdminDetail][Detailed Documentation by Admin Role]] page that corresponds to the admin task you're charged with. Each of these pages includes links to background information, support information, best practices, and other helpful tidbits.

#AdminDetail
---+++ Detailed Documentation by Admin Role
There are lots of different administrator tasks involved in the setup and running of OSG services and resources.
