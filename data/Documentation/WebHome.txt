#InTro
---++Introduction
The Documentation TWiki Web serves as central hub of OSG community-developed documentation for OSG resource users and administrators.  You may need to start at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000059][Getting Started]] to learn about the different ways to participate in OSG.
No matter what your role in OSG, you'll need to at least do the following things to participate in OSG:

#UserDoc
---++ User Documentation
How an end-user runs a VO-specific application is determined by the user's VO, in particular by the VO's application administrator.  Beyond the information presented in  [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000059][Getting Started]] and some general information here, OSG can only point you to your VO for documentation on submitting jobs to OSG resources.  We provide an area under [[VO/WebHome]] for VOs to provide documentation and/or links to their websites.  Go to [[VO/WebHome]] and look up your VO in the left-hand column of the table.  Across the row, you should find various categories of information pertaining to your VO, e.g., User Info, Application, Support.  If not, please contact your [[SupportCenters][VO support center]].
  
%RED%The following information is being reorganized... we'll leave it here until we're sure we've got everything that's useful in an easy-to-find place. %ENDCOLOR%

#AdminDoc

---++ Administrator Documentation
If you've done your administrative task before, you might prefer to use the appropriate [[#AdminQuick][quick link]] below. In general, we recommend that you read the [[#AdminDetail][Detailed Documentation by Admin Role]] page that corresponds to the admin task you're charged with. Each of these pages includes links to background information, support information, best practices, and other helpful tidbits.

#AdminDetail
---+++ Detailed Documentation by Admin Role
There are lots of different administrator tasks involved in the setup and running of OSG services and resources.
