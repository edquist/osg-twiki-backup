All OSG sites are registered with OIM and presented via [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu][MyOSG]]. OIM maintains information on every site in a DB, and verifies this information regularly. Resources that fail basic functionality tests are marked in red, resources that pass all basic tests are green.  Check !MyOSG to see which resources support your VO.

To get a list of contact string for sites that support your VO from the BDII server, you could use the following LDAP query.

<pre class="screen">
$ <userinput>ldapsearch -LLL -h is.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 -x -b 'o=grid' GlueCEAccessControlBaseRule=VO:YOUR_VO_NAME  GlueCEUniqueID | grep 'GlueCEUniqueID:'</userinput>
</pre>

*NOTE:* The instructions below are not valid on most OSG sites, since most sites no longer run LDAP server, so you have to use -h is.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 to contact the OSG wide BDII

If you want to check a particular resource, you could submit an LDAP query to the resource. For example, the following =ldapsearch= checks if the CDF VO is supported at CIT_CMS_T2.  You'd use the same directory server hostname (the argument to  =-h=) and port (=-p= argument)

<pre class="screen">
$ <userinput>ldapsearch -LLL -h cit-gatekeeper.ultralight.org -p 2135 -x -b   &#92;
   mds-vo-name=CIT_CMS_T2,o=grid "GlueCEName=cdf"</userinput>
</pre>

If supported, it will return a series of entries. If not, it returns an empty string.

In addition, you can get more detailed information through LDAP queries to the site. For example, if you want to find out if worker nodes at =CIT_CMS_T2= have outgoing connections, you can do:

<pre class="screen">
$ <userinput>ldapsearch -LLL -h cit-gatekeeper.ultralight.org -p 2135 -x -b   &#92;
   mds-vo-name=CIT_CMS_T2,o=grid "(GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP=*)"   &#92;
   GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP</userinput>
GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP: TRUE
</pre>
