---+!! Find an available resource

This section will discuss first how to find sites by hand and how to find sites in a machine-readable format.  The point is to first get a "human grasp" on what's available, then slowly introduce the machine-readable formats.

All OSG sites are registered in a central database called OIM and presented via a webpage called [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu][MyOSG]]. OIM maintains information on every site in a DB, and verifies this information regularly. Resources that fail basic functionality tests are marked in red, resources that pass all basic tests are green.

To get a list of contact string for sites that support your VO, you can query the BDII server.  Try the following query directly:

<pre class="screen">
<userinput>ldapsearch -LLL -h is.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 -x -b 'o=grid' GlueCEAccessControlBaseRule=VO:YOUR_VO_NAME  GlueCEUniqueID | grep 'GlueCEUniqueID:'</userinput>
</pre>

Of course, this is only for illustrative purposes - we recommend understanding the BDII exists and be queried, but use matchmaking software from having to do this in your application.  If you find yourself programming BDII queries into your code, ask for help.  It's likely you might be approaching something wrong.

In addition, you can get more detailed information through LDAP queries to the site. For example, if you want to find out if worker nodes at =CIT_CMS_T2= have outgoing connections, you can do:

<pre class="screen">
$ <userinput>ldapsearch -LLL -h is.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 -x -b   &#92;
   mds-vo-name=CIT_CMS_T2,o=grid "(GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP=*)"   &#92;
   GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP</userinput>
GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP: TRUE
</pre>
