---++ About This Document
This document is a procedure that can be followed to produce an OSG Glossary in pdf format that is a clean (without comment boxes, footers, repeated linkages to each letter, etc.) version for publication.  The resulting pdf file will also have working internal linkages that do not rely on access to the !TWiki Glossary page.
