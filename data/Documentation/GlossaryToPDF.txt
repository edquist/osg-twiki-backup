---+!! Convert the Glossary of Terms to PDF

---+ About This Document

This document is a procedure that can be followed to produce an OSG Glossary in pdf format that is a clean (without comment boxes, footers, repeated linkages to each letter, etc.) version for publication.  The resulting pdf file will also have working internal linkages that do not rely on access to the !TWiki Glossary page.

---+ Procedure

This procedure works best using Firefox on a Mac.  (Safari will work, but you cannot control the page headers and footers when the pdf file is created.  You can turn them off, but you can't get just the page number in the footer.)  You also need a Unix machine, a Mac, or a Windows computer with [[http://www.cygwin.com/][Cygwin]] in order to run the script in the attachment:

   1 Open GlossaryOfTerms and click "Print version" link at the bottom of the page.
   1 Save the page as an html document (File -> Save Page as or Page Source).
   1 Using a Unix machine or Mac terminal window, execute the shell script, =cleanglossary.sh=, attached to this document.  
      1 Save the script to the same directory that you saved the html file in the previous step.
      1 Make the script executable: =chmod u+x cleanglossary.sh=
      1 Use a terminal window to run the script: =./cleanglossary.sh -f !GlossaryOfTerms.html -o !CleanGlossary.html=  To see the options run: =./cleanglossary.sh -h=
   1 Open the resulting !CleanGlossary.html file to verify it worked.
   1 Convert the html file to a pdf.
      1 On a Mac, File -> Print
      1 Expand the Print dialog window (arrow by the printer), and set the page footer to be "Page # to #"
      1 Open the PDF button and "Save as PDF"
      1 Edit the filename (e.g. OSG_Glossary.pdf), etc.
   1 Open the resulting pdf and verify it works.
