%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% Welcome to OSG Networking.  This is the entry point for those interested in Networking in OSG.  It provides an overview of the networking goals, plans and various activities and subtopics underway regarding networking in the Open Science Grid.  This is a new area for OSG which started in June 2012 and is initially focused on network monitoring.   OSG wants to be able to provide all needed  networking information for OSG users, sites and VOs.

---++ Content Sections
First year plans for OSG networking include activity in these areas related to network monitoring:
   * [[perfSONARToolKit][The perfSONAR-PS toolkit:]] development, packaging, configuring and supporting the toolkit in the context of OSG but potentially applicable to a diverse set of users and VOs.
   * [[NetworkingModularDashboard][The Networking Modular Dashboard:]] targeting the development, packaging, deployment and maintenance of a modular dashboard service which collects, aggregates, displays and provides network related metrics from the perfSONAR-PS toolkit deployments at OSG and other sites.
   * [[NetworkingTroubleShooting][Network problem solving documentation:]]  Updating and augmenting OSG documentation related to network problem troubleshooting using OSG distributed tools, software and services.
