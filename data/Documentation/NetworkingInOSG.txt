---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% *Welcome to OSG Networking!*  This is the entry point for those interested in Networking in OSG or for those OSG users experiencing network problems.  It provides an overview of the networking goals, plans and various activities and subtopics underway regarding networking in the Open Science Grid.  This area for OSG started in June 2012 and initially focused on network monitoring.  Monitoring is critical to provide needed visibility into existing networks and site connectivity.  OSG is working to provide needed networking information and tools for OSG users, sites and VOs.  

Users with network issues should check the [[NetworkingTroubleShooting][troubleshooting link]] below for guidance on how best to get their issue resolved.

---++ OSG  Networking  Components
First year plans for OSG networking include activity in these areas related to network monitoring:
   * [[perfSONARToolKit][The perfSONAR-PS toolkit:]] development, packaging, configuring and supporting the toolkit in the context of OSG but potentially applicable to a diverse set of users and VOs.
   * [[NetworkingModularDashboard][The Networking Modular Dashboard & OSG Network Service:]] targeting the development, packaging, deployment and maintenance of a modular dashboard service which collects, aggregates, displays and provides network related metrics from the perfSONAR-PS toolkit deployments at OSG and other sites.
   * [[NetworkingTroubleShooting][Network problem solving documentation:]]  Updating and augmenting OSG documentation related to network problem troubleshooting using OSG distributed tools, software and services.

---++  Other Useful  Networking  References
The [[http://psps.perfsonar.net/toolkit/][perfSONAR-PS]] toolkit is part of the [[http://www.perfsonar.net/][perfSONAR]] project.   
The current perfSONAR-PS toolkit is [[http://software.internet2.edu/pSPT3.3-rc4/][available for download]]

ESnet  maintains  an  excellent  set of  pages  about  networking,  end-system  tuning,  tools  and  techniques at https://fasterdata.es.net/  

The  High-Energy physics  community  is  also using  perfSONAR and  their pages on perfSONAR  and network  monitoring  can  be found  at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/PerfsonarDeployment
