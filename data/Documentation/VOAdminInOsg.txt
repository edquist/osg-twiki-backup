---+ How does a VO fit into the OSG Infrastructure?
%RED%Under construction!%ENDCOLOR%

A VO is, most simply, an organizational structure formed to identify and control people who wish access to grid resources. A VO must become a member of OSG in order for its members to access the resources. By the same token, resource users must be authenticated and authorized under the auspices of a member VO. VOs are typically organized around research efforts, e.g., there is one VO for the ATLAS HEP experiment, another for the LIGO project, and so on.

VOs can organize their users into groups and assign them roles.  Different levels of authorization can be associated with roles. OSG sites, where CE and/or SE resources are maintained, enforce local authorization on incoming jobs.  They rely on information coming from member VOs to determine what (local) level of authorization to grant. Authorization in OSG is implemented via the components of the VO Privilege Project.

---++ VO as Component of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
VOs can organize their users into groups and assign them roles.  Different levels of authorization can be associated with roles, so the VO can control who has access to what, based on what the users are doing rather than who they are. OSG sites, where CE and/or SE resources are maintained, enforce local authorization on incoming jobs.  They rely on information coming from member VOs to determine what (local) level of authorization to grant. Authorization in OSG is implemented via the components of the VO Privilege Project.

---++ RBAC Infrastructure
The OSG has implemented a role-based access control infrastructure which provides a framework for role-based access to resources and services. Within OSG, the RBAC infrastructure supports:
The OSG RBAC infrastructure provides a framework for role-based access to resources and services. The OSG software stack, using VDT 1.3.6 and above, includes an implementation (the [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/index.html][Privilege Project]]) to administer and apply role-based access control to compute and storage resources (CEs and SEs). The current implementation provides for the following:
The OSG has implemented a RBAC infrastructure which provides a framework for role-based access to resources and services. Within OSG, the RBAC infrastructure supports:

   * Extended X509 certificates (VOMS extended certificates) to include [[VORolesAndGroups][group membership and multiple roles]].
   * Site-based mapping of certificates to UNIX accounts based on extended proxy certificates.
   * Application of Policy through an implementation of the standard Globus Gatekeeper, GridFTP and SRM/dCache callouts.
Within OSG, the RBAC infrastructure supports:
   * Site administrators defining local accounts based on groups and roles of the supported VOs
   * Users defining their role for any resource access
   * VO administrators defining privileges based on role and group definitions

---+++ The Integrated Solution
The OSG components provide an integrated solution to role-based access control based on:
   * [[http://www.globus.org][Globus gatekeeper and GridFTP server callouts]]
   * [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS][GUMS Grid User Management System]]
   * [[http://infnforge.cnaf.infn.it/voms/][INFN VOMS VO Membership Service]]
   * the SRM/dCache storage service and [[http://osgdocdb.opensciencegrid.org/0001/000108/001/plugable-authorization-module-infofermilab.doc][gPLAZMA module]]
   * [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/index.html][the PRIMA modules]].
   $ [[http://www.globus.org][Globus gatekeeper and GridFTP server callouts]]: The Globus Toolkit GridFTP Server reads two files (=gsi-authz.conf= and =gsi-gaa.conf=) to determine how to perform certain authorization and mapping functions. If these files are not present , the GridFTP server will determine the user's permissions based solely on the user's identity (this is not what we want). There is a callout command to create these files, and the GridFTP server will honor CAS policy assertions. ([[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/cas/key/index.html][CAS]] allows resource providers to specify course-grained access control policies in terms of communities as a whole, delegating fine-grained access control policy management to the community itself.)
   $ [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS][GUMS Grid User Management System]]: !GUMS maps a Grid entity to a local username (UID) at the requested resource based on the entity&#8217;s X.509 name and provided attributes.
