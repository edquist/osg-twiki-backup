---+ Where does a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo fit into the OSG Infrastructure?
---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo as Gateway for Individuals to use OSG Resources
On this page, we are using the term "VO" as the organization that manages members and member-related services (i.e., we are ignoring computing and storage resources).
A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must register with OSG in order for its members to access the resources at OSG sites. By the same token, individual grid users must be authenticated and authorized under the auspices of an OSG-registered VO. I.e., individuals not affiliated with a member VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo are excluded. VOs are typically organized around research efforts, e.g., there is one VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo for the [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/ATLAS][ATLAS]] HEP experiment, another for the [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/LIGO][LIGO project]], and so on.  However, in some cases, an "umbrella" VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo encompasses a number of research efforts, e.g., the [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/FERMILAB][fermilab VO]] encompasses several HEP experiments at Fermilab, and the (confusingly named) OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo encompasses people from numerous small research groups.

---++ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Infrastructure
The OSG has implemented a role-based access control infrastructure which provides a framework for role-based access to resources and services. Within OSG, the RBAC infrastructure supports:

   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators defining privileges based on role and group definitions
   * Site administrators defining local accounts with privileges based on groups and roles of the supported VOs
   * Service-based (rather than host-based) granularity for authorization 
   * Users specifying their role when requesting resource access
   * Multiple roles per user, thus multiple privileges possible at the same time
   * Multi-user environment in which traditional UID-based auditing is possible if desired

---+++ !!VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo as Component of RBAC
VOs can organize their users into groups and assign them roles.  Different levels of authorization can be associated with roles, so the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo can control who has access to what, based on what the users are doing rather than who they are. OSG sites, where CE and/or SE resources are maintained, enforce local authorization on incoming jobs.  To set the local authorization appropriately, they rely on information coming from member VOs. The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo therefore must implement VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS software that provides role information to the OSG middleware, from which the sites can pull it.  (Users must provide their job-specific role and group, via a certificate extension from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, to a site upon submission of a job, so that the site can set the authorization properly.)

---+++ !!Implementation of Roles and Privileges
The OSG software stack, using VDT 1.3.6 and above, includes [[Integration/PrivilegeOSG][privilege components]] which administer and apply role-based access control (RBAC) to compute and storage resources (CEs and SEs).  The current implementation provides for the following:

   * Extended X509 certificates (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS extended certificates) to include [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRolesAndGroups][group membership and multiple roles]].
   * Site-based mapping of certificates to UNIX accounts based on extended proxy certificates.
   * Application of Policy through an implementation of the standard Globus Gatekeeper, !GridFTP and SRM/dCache callouts.

---+++ !!The Integrated Solution
The OSG components provide an integrated solution to role-based access control based on:
   $ [[http://www.globus.org][Globus gatekeeper and !GridFTP server callouts]]: The Globus Toolkit !GridFTP Server on the CE gatekeeper reads two files (=gsi-authz.conf= and =gsi-gaa.conf=) to determine how to perform certain authorization and mapping functions. If these files are not present, the !GridFTP server will determine the user's permissions based solely on the user's identity (this is not what we want). There is a callout command to create these files, and the !GridFTP server will honor CAS policy assertions.     (Globus' [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/cas/key/index.html][CAS]] allows sites to specify course-grained access control policies in terms of communities, i.e., VOs, as a whole, delegating fine-grained access control policy management to the community itself.)

   $ [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS][GUMS Grid User Management System]]: !GUMS maps a Grid entity to a local username (UID) at the requested resource based on the entity&#8217;s X.509 name and provided attributes.

   $ [[http://infnforge.cnaf.infn.it/voms/][INFN VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Membership Service]]: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS allows a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to manage information about its members, to provide appropriate tokens to users, and to communicate with grid middleware.

   $ the SRM/dCache storage service: SRM/dCache provides storage for huge amounts of data, a common interface to physical storage systems, and storage management tools. It handles load balancing and system failure and recovery.

   $ the grid-aware [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book/cf-gplazma.shtml][PLuggable !AuthoriZation MAnagement (!gPLAZMA) module]]: !gPLAZMA invokes plugins for authorization methods.

   $ [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/index.html][the PRIMA modules]]: PRIMA extracts the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes containing the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and role information from the user's proxy certificate, and queries the identity mapping service for an appropriate local user account assignment.

---++ What does this involve for you as a VO?

   * First of all, you must run a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS (or equivalent) installation, as we've said. 
   * If you wish to use fine-grained authorization, you need to define groups, roles and privileges.  We suggest that you facilitate the management of users, groups, roles, and site requirements by interfacing your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server to a VOM Registration Service (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS) installation.
   * Your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo needs to approve new VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo members, and manage the status of members (i.e., do they have a valid X509 certificate). 
   * You  must communicate your minimal group/role-to-privilege requirements to the Grid Operations Center (GOC) in order for the appropriate privileges to be honored. 
   * For "special" sites, i.e. ones that belong to your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo or ones with which you have made arrangements for fine-grained authorization, you must communicate your authorization requirements individually.
