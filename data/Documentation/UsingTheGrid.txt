---+ An Introduction to OSG for End-Users

This page is aimed at beginning users who want to use the resources on the OSG.  Every user must be associated with a registered organization (called a VO).  Many large VOs (such as ATLAS and CMS) already have extensive user documentation; these pages are primarily oriented at users of smaller VOs who might be porting their own or community applications to the OSG.

These pages first introduce the primary OSG concepts, then dives into the nuts and bolts of building (or porting) an application to the grid by showing demonstration applications of increasing complexity.  Both job management and data management are covered. 

---++ Open Science Grid

   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/WhatIsOSG][What is OSG?]]  This page introduces the "big-picture" concepts of *what the OSG is, what it is not,* and what it tries to achieve.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/WhatIsOSG#Virtual_Organizations][What are VOs?]]  Virtual Organizations - "VOs" - are an important organizational concept for the OSG; this page *introduces VOs for the end-user*.

---++ Security
   * [[CertificateWhatIs][What is a certificate?]]  A digital certificate is like a passport for the grid.  This page introduces them to new users, and includes links for getting your own certificate.
   * [[GetAccessToGrid][How do you get access to a site?]]  The certificate provides you with an identity - but doesn't give you access rights to a site!  This page describes *how one gets authorized at an OSG site*.

---++ Using the OSG
---+++ Installing the OSG Client
All of the following sections will focus on job and data management on the OSG in order to build a successful grid application.

These will all assume that you have the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG client software installed]].

---+++ Running Jobs
   * [[FindAvailableResource][Finding OSG sites to run your jobs]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest][Basic tools (globus-job-run, globus-url-copy, for testing only)]]
   * Running jobs with Condor-G.  Condor-G is the most common client tool for submitting jobs directly to the grid.  The following pages cover the most common usage patterns; each link builds upon the knowledge learned in the previous one.
      * [[CondorSubmittingSingleJob][Submitting a single, simple job with Condor-G]].
      * [[CondorSubmittingMultipleJobs][Submitting multiple, simple jobs with Condor-G]].
      * [[CondorSubmittingMultipleComplexJobs][More complex Condor-G jobs]].
      * [[CondorSubmittingDAG][Building workflows in Condor-G]].
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/UsingWorkerNodeClient][The OSG job environment (Where can I install software? What's in the environment?)]]
   * [[http://osgmm.sourceforge.net/][Using the OSG Matchmaker to run jobs]].  The OSG Match Maker does that work of site discovery, verification, and selection for you.  It is easy-to-install and works for a wide variety of users.
   * [[GoldenRulesForPowerUsers][Best practices for running lots of jobs]].

---+++ Data management
   * [[Storage/WebHome#Storage_for_the_End_User][Overview of data management approaches]]
   * [[FindStorageResources][Finding storage resources]].  Finding storage resources for you to use.
   * The basics: Moving files between sites with Condor-G and SRM.
   * Best practices: How to grow your data-hungry application successfully on the OSG.
   * [[Storage/StorageEndUser][Reference of End-user tools]]

---+++ Advanced
Beyond "traditional", basic job handling, there is a wide variety of specialized topics for using the OSG.  Here are a few which may appeal to advanced users:
   * [[Documentation.HighThroughputParallelComputing][High-Throughput Parallel Computing]]: This page covers how to submit multi-core (which may be MPI or just traditional multi-threaded) jobs on the OSG using Condor.
   * [[Documentation.GlobusRslAttributes][Globus RSL language usage on the OSG]]: Globus RSL is a mini-language that controls advanced, specific aspects of your jobs.  For some users, this might be necessary for their jobs; we recommend it against using RSL heavily because it is not portable between sites.
