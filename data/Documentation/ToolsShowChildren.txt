This topic will list the children topics of any topic in which is included. It lists them in a bulleted list that is created in straight HTML because I couldn't figure out a better way with TWiki commands.

To use this topic, use __one__ of the following, since =ToolsBottomMatter= includes this topic, too:
   * =<nop>%INCLUDE{ "Documentation.ToolsShowChildren" }<nop>%=
   * =<nop>%INCLUDE{ "Documentation.ToolsBottomMatter" }<nop>%=

=============BEGIN THE INCLUDED SECTION =========

__Immediate children of this topic include the following:__
<ul>%CALC{ "$SUBSTITUTE(%METASEARCH{type="parent" web="%BASEWEB%" topic="%BASETOPIC%"  }%, <a h, <li><a h, , r)" }%</ul>
%STOPINCLUDE%
=============END THE INCLUDED SECTION =========
