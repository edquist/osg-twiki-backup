   $ Head Node: This is an inexact term that generally refers to a node in an site cluster through which jobs are submitted. In a simple cluster, the head node is the one on which the gatekeeper and monitoring software are installed. In a more complicated cluster, there may be multiple gatekeepers on different nodes, and other issues, thus "head node" is not well defined. A head node would be networked to a group of worker nodes.

   $ HE(N)P: High Energy (and Nuclear) Physics Host A physical computing element. This element characterizes the physical configuration of a computing node, including processors, software, storage elements, etc.

#DefsHierarchicalResourceManager
   $ Hierarchical Resource Manager: An SRM that manages access to both one or more disk caches and one or more tape archiving systems.

#DefsHierarchicalStorageManager
   $ Hierarchical Storage Management: HSM systems transparently migrate files from more expensive hard disk systems to cheaper optical disk and/or magnetic tape, usually robotically accessible. When a user requests the files, the HSM transparently moves them back to the hard disk system. _See_ also [[][tertiary  storage]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Storage_Management][HSM at Wikipedia]] and [[http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~rdv/comp-arch-storage/FAQ-1.html][comp.arch.storage FAQ]]

#DefsHighThroughputComputing
   $ High Throughput Computing: Computing environments that deliver large amounts of processing capacity over long periods of time (floating point operations per month rather than FLOPS). _See_ [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/htc.html][Condor High Throughput Computing]].
<!--
   $ hot spot _or_ hotspot<a name="DefsHotSpot">: (dCache) an event where a single device or file from a particular device is being heavily requested.
-->
#DefsHpss
   $ HPSS: A commercial High Performance Storage System designed to scale beyond a petabyte and be highly reliable.  _See_ [[http://www.hpss-collaboration.org][HPSS Collaboration]].

#DefsHrm
   $ HRM: _See_ [[#DefsHierarchicalResourceManager][Hierarchical Resource Manager]].

#DefsHsm
   $ HSM: _See_ [[#DefsHierarchicalStorageManager][Hierarchical Storage Manager]].

#DefsHtc
   $ HTC: _See_ [[#DefsHighThroughputComputing][High Throughput Computing]].
