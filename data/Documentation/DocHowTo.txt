---++ The Documentation Process
The overall documentation process is described in this section.  This includes information on how Owners, Reviewers, and Testers control the creation, review, and update of documents.  

---+++ Process Introduction
There are three interrelated processes that involve documentation:
   1. Ownership/Review Process
   1. Testing/New Release Process
   1. Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process

Each of these are straightforward and take into account the low resource, collaborative environment of OSG.
The first and third of these processes are owned by the Content Management Area Coordinator who is responsible for maintaining the process descriptions, changing the processes as needed, and managing the execution of the processes with the help of the [[#Documentation_Architect_Responsibilities][Documentation Architect]].
The second process is owned and managed by the OSG Integration & Sites Coordinator.

---+++ Ownership/Review Process
Documents are separated into a set of areas, each with an owner that has overall responsibility for that area.  The area owner manages the structure of the area's documentation and ensures the documents have the following roles assigned.
Each document in the official OSG Documentation TWiki must have an Owner who is responsible for creation and/or maintenance/update of that document.
The Owner is named within the document using the OWNER variable.
The responsibilities of the Owner are listed in the [[#Document_Owner_Responsibilities][Document Owner Responsibilities]] section.

Most documents will also have a Reviewer who is responsible for reviewing the document for content, accuracy, usability, and format.
The Reviewer is named within the document using the REVIEWER variable.
The responsibilities of the Reviewer are listed in [[#Document_Reviewer_Responsibilities][Document Reviewer Responsibilities]] section.

Documents that include procedures to be followed by the readers should also have a Tester who is responsible for testing the procedure to verify that it produces the expected results.  The Tester is named within the document using the TESTER variable.  The Tester responsibilities are listed in [[#Document_Tester_Responsibilities][Document Tester Responsibilities]] section.

The steps in the Ownership/Review Process apply to all documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki
(currently Documentation.WebHome and [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][ReleaseDocumentation]]).  
They are:
   1. For any new or existing document (that is not being eliminated), an Owner and Reviewer are identified.  These assignments can be proposed by the Area Owner, made by a person volunteering to take the role (preferred), by local management selection, or  by the Area Owner and/or the Content Management Area Coordinator or Documentation Architect working in conjunction with the person and the person's local management.
   1. The Owner produces or makes the existing document conform to the standards/template (see [[#Document_Types][Document Types]] section) and marks the REVIEW_READY variable to %%NOP%YES%.  (The REVIEW_PASSED variable should be %%NOP%IN_PROGRESS%.)
   1. The Reviewer reviews the document and marks the variable REVIEW_PASSED either %%NOP%YES% or %%NOP%NO%.  If NO, then the Reviewer works in collaboration with the Owner to resolve issues with the document until the Reviewer is ready to mark the REVIEW_PASSED variable %%NOP%YES%.
      a. If the document is a procedure or installation document, the Reviewer will mark the TEST_READY variable %%NOP%YES%. (The TEST_PASSED variable should be %%NOP%IN_PROGRESS%.)
      a. The Tester will perform the test, document any problems, and mark the variable TEST_PASSED to %%NOP%YES% (or %%NOP%NO%).
      a. If the test failed, the Tester will collaborate with the Owner to resolve any issues discovered by the testing.  When resolved the Tester will mark the variable TEST_PASSED to %%NOP%YES%.
   1. When the Review and Owner are satisfied with the document, the Reviewer or Owner marks the RELEASE_READY variable to %%NOP%YES%.

Or pictorially:

The list of documents and their owners and reviewers and document status is automatically maintained by the tables that can be created using tools described in DocManagementVariables.  These tables can be generated at various document levels, including Area level, the individual level (all documents the person has a role in), or the Release level (all official documents).

---+++ Testing/New Release Process
This process applies to all documents in the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][ReleaseDocumentation Web]].  When a new release of the OSG software is being integrated, documented, and tested, the Integration & Sites Coordinator manages the process.  That process uses the Owner, Reviewer, and Tester consistent with the Ownership/Review process above.  The management of documents for major and minor releases is detailed in DocReleaseProcess.

---+++ Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process
This process covers the ongoing evaluation and improvement of OSG documentation.  It makes use of user feedback in the form of comments and a document rating mechanism to identify documents or document areas in need of improvement.  In addition the Document Architect and Content Management Area Coordinator may review messages in mailing lists and other information to identify areas needing improvement.

On a quarterly basis, a set of documents will be identified for improvement.  The Owner and Reviewer for each of these will be asked to make improvements that will be tracked by the Document Architect.  At the same time particularly well rated documents will be identified to use as examples of high-quality documents.  Once a year, the best of our documents will be identified and their Owners and Reviewers will be recognized.

%NOTE% The user rating of documents is not yet implemented, so the parts of this section that require those ratings are not currently being done.

---+++ Comments
| Use of a set of boolean variables for the status is quite awkward and ultimately non-descriptive. I suggest using the following states.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Ready to update&#60;br /&#62;Update in progress&#60;br /&#62;Ready to review&#60;br /&#62;Review in progress&#60;br /&#62;Ready to test&#60;br /&#62;Test in progress&#60;br /&#62;Release ready&#60;br /&#62;Released &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;It is simpler if a document is in one precise state, rather that some combination of bits. %RED%We are staying with the variables as defined.  This will work in both the case of specific edit->review->test->release sequence as well as other more parallel approaches.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:19 |
| According to Robert a document can be in more than one state at a time in the sequence EDIT&#62;REVIEW&#62;TEST&#62;RELEASE? I don&#39;t understand that. %RED%Yes, it can but that is under the control of the Owner.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:04 |
| If testing can be done while the document is in review, which I don&#39;t recommend, what happens if the review results in a change to the document? Is testing redone? If not, how does one know that no error has been introduced? %RED%I would agree with you in most cases, but I would say it was ok if the Reviewer is cleaning up wording and not changing the essence and order of the steps.  I trust people to make good decisions here.  (And most will not do it in parallel.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:43 |

---++ Classifications and Templates Used for Documents
Documents are classified by type of document, target audience, and document area. 

---+++ Document Types
Documents can be of several different types.  Types are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_TYPE.  The Templates are recommended formatting and sections to be included in the associated document type.
| *Document Type* | *Definition* | *Template* |
| !HowTo | A procedure telling how to do something | Documentation/DocumentationTeam.DocHowToTemplate |
| Installation | A specific procedural document for installation of software | ReleaseDocumentation.DocInstallTemplate |
| Navigation | A document designed to help a person navigate to other documents | |
| Planning | A document used for planning.  E.g. Planning an OSG site. | |
| Knowledge | Any document not of another type.  E.g. general information, explanation, description. | |
| Training | A document designed for training or used organize or manage a training event | |
| Troubleshooting | A troubleshooting document | Documentation/DocumentationTeam.DocTroubleshootingTemplate |

---+++ Document User Roles
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be used by people in another role (called the secondary role).  Since few documents cover multiple roles, we do not specify a secondary role in a document.  Roles are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_ROLE.
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| !EndUser | A user of the the Grid |
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training specifically written for another role would be classified as that role as primary and student as secondary. |
| !SysAdmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOManager | A manager in a Virtual Organization as contrasted with one of the above roles |
| Developer | Any software developer |
| Documenter | Any person working on documentation itself |

---+++ Document Areas
The documentation universe is segmented into a set of areas, each of which has an owner having overall responsibility for the documentation of that area.  The Areas are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_AREA.
| *Documentation Area* | *Definition* | *Area Owner* |
| !ComputeElement | Compute Element | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| Storage | Storage Element or Storage | Main.TanyaLevshina |
| VO | Virtual Organization | Main.AbhishekSinghRana |
| Security | Security | Main.MineAltunay |
| !EndUser | End User of OSG resources.  E.g. Typically a Scientist or Student | Main.BrianBockelman |
| Monitoring | Monitoring, Accounting, and Metrics | Main.BrianBockelman |
| Integration | Related to an OSG release or for the Integration Team | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| Operations | Operational procedures or related to GOC services | Main.RobQ |
| Tier3 | Specific to LHC project Tier 3 Sites | Main.MarcoMambelli |
| General | General documents and documents about documentation itself | Main.RobertEngel |

---+++ Comments
| Could you put the corresponding HTML variable here for easy reference. %RED%OK, added comment and link to variables for each of the tables.%ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:36 |
| Haven&#39;t we changed the Student role to End User? %RED%Yes, I updated the roles and also fixed an inconsistencies in the other 2 tables.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:37 |
| A comment on other pages, not this one: many release documents have installation and troubleshooting on the same page. %RED%True and that is OK.  The document type of a combined document is that of the primary type, in this case, Installation.  In addition there are some stand alone Troubleshooting documents that will use the Troubleshooting Type | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:06 |
| Should we not use the same phrase &#34;End User&#34;, or such, in Document Areas as in Document User Roles, since it is already so close? %RED%Yes, we should.  I fixed the tables and asked Robert to fix the HTML and Homepage search drop downs to be consistent.%ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:17 |

---++ Content Management Control Variables and Tracking
The OSG Release Process includes a set of variables that should be used in all documents that refer to the items represented by those variables.  In addition, the OSG process of creation, update, review, and testing of documents is managed through the use of 
a set of variables at the beginning of each page.  Finally, there is a set of command-like variables that allow you to easily create status tables for documents of interest to you.  These variables are described in the following sections.

#ContentManagementVariables
---+++ Document Management Variables and Tracking Status Tables

---++ Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the Documentation Architect and the Document Owners, Reviewers, and Testers are explained in the following sections.

---+++ Documentation Architect Responsibilities
The OSG Documentation Architect is responsible for establishing and maintaining the overall architecture, standards, processes, and guidelines for documentation provided by OSG for its members.  The person in this role, working with the Area Coordinator, OSG management, and content providers:
   1. Provides guidelines for the organization and location of documents and the structure of the interface to the documentation system, including interfaces designed around the roles of the primary users. 
   1. Specifies and evolves the documentation processes and associated technology, including ownership, owner responsibilities, document creation and review, document update, document removal, document certification/acceptance, and tracking of the status of documents.
   1. Names the primary document types and creates and evolves the recommended document standard for each document type, including the content areas, structure, and format.  Provides TWiki templates for the primary document types.
   1. Ensures, in conjunction with management, that documents have named owners who understand and follow up on their responsibility.
   1. Identifies missing areas or items in the documentation system and ensures there are owners who create the missing documentation.
   1. Establishes a system to enable user comments on documents and to collect and evaluate user rating of documents.
   1. Produces a training program on our documentation processes and standards and delivers this to document owners.

---+++ Document Owner Responsibilities
Each document in the Official OSG Documentation TWiki must have an Owner.  Document Owners should also be familiar with the responsibilities of the Reviewers and Testers.
%BR%%BR%
The owner of a document should have knowledge about the topic of the document and is responsible for:
   1. Creating the document (if it doesn't exist).
   1. Inserting and updating the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management Variables]] in the HTML block
   1. Testing or ensuring that testing is done on the software and version the document applies to.
   1. Updating the document when:
      a. Errors are discovered (by document users or the Integration Team).
      a. Users make comments in the document noting problems or improvements needed.
      a. Software or other changes make the document out of date.
      a. New OSG releases require a change in the document.
      a. The document is identified by the Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process as needing improvement (up to 2 times a year).
   1. Working in collaboration with the Reviewer of the document to resolve issues identified by the Reviewer after each significant update.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Tester of the document to resolve issues from a test of procedures (if applicable).
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Owner.

---+++ Document Reviewer Responsibilities
Most documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki have a Reviewer.
%BR%%BR%
The reviewer of a document should have knowledge about standards and format for the type of document being reviewed and is responsible for:
   1. Performing a review (when the Owner marks the document as REVIEW_READY and REVIEW_PASSED is IN_PROGRESS) and correcting or noting issues (via email or the document Comment block) for the Owner.  The review should verify that the document:
      a. Contains the relevant sections specified in the template for the relevant document type.
      a. Sections and content conform to the formatting standards for the relevant document type (e.g. see DocFormattingRules).
      a. Is clearly written and can be understood by a reader with varying levels of expertise.
      a. Has or refers to a diagram of the appropriate architecture (if applicable).
      a. Is technically accurate and complete (the Reviewer is not responsible for actually testing a procedure).
      a. Contains no typos or wording errors.
   1. Updating the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] REVIEW_PASSED variable.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner to ensure the issues you identify are resolved in the document.
   1. Doing a final review when you, the Tester, and the Owner agree it is complete and updating the REVIEW_PASSED variable.
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Reviewer.

---+++ Document Tester Responsibilities
Procedural documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki should have a Tester.
%BR%%BR%
Each installation or procedure document in the OSG Documentation TWiki should be tested. The purpose of the test is to check if the documented procedures yield expected results when carried out. A document needs to be tested:
   1. After it has been created.
   1. After major changes to the document have been made.
   1. Before major releases.%BR%
The Tester should preferably be a person that is not:
   1. The developer of the software or procedure described in the document.
   1. The owner of the document.%BR%
The Tester of a document should only have a general knowledge about the topic of the document. To follow the instructions of the document, the tester must have access to facilities needed for the test (e.g. a local site resource or ITB resource). The Tester is responsible for:
   1. Performing a test (when the Owner marks the document TEST_READY and TEST_PASSED is IN_PROGRESS) of the instructions on the software and version the document is meant to be used with and noting any problems or anomalies.
   1. Updating the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] TEST_PASSED variable.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner of the document to resolve issues from a test of procedures.
   1. Doing a final test (if necessary) after the issues are resolved to verify the procedure presented the document can be performed successfully and updating TEST_PASSED variable.
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Tester.
%NOTE%  The roles of the Reviewer and Tester are different!  The Reviewer is only responsible to check documents for their readability, logical structure, and conformance to standards, while the Tester must apply the procedures as described in the document.
