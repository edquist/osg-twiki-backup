---++ The Documentation Process
---++ Classifications Used for Documents
Documents are classified by type of document, target audience, and document area.
---+++ Document Types
Documents can be of several different types:
| *Document Type* | *Definition* |
| Howto | A procedure telling how to do something |
| Installation | A specific procedural document for installation of software |
| Navigation | A document designed to help a person navigate to other documents |
| Planning | A document used for planning.  E.g. Planning an OSG site. | 
| Knowledge | Any document not of another type.  E.g. general information, explanation, description. |
| Training | A document designed for training |
---+++ Document User Roles
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be expected to be used by people in other role(s) (called secondary role).  Those roles are defined by:
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| Scientist | A user of the the Grid, sometimes called an End User |
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training specifically written for another role would be classified as that role as primary and student as secondary. |
| Sysadmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOmanager | A manager in a Virtual Organization as contrasted with one of the above roles |
| Developer | Any software developer |
---+++ Document Areas
The documentation universe is segmented into a set of areas, each of which has an owner having overall responsibility for the documentation of that area.
| *Documentation Area* | *Definition* |
| !ComputeElement | Compute Element |
| Storage | Storage Element or Storage |
| !VirtualOrganization | Virtual Organization |
| Security | Security |
| User | User of OSG resources.  E.g. Typically a Scientist or Student |
| Monitoring | Monitoring, Accounting, and Metrics |
| Integration | Related to an OSG release or for the Integration Team |
| Operations | Operational procedures or related to GOC services |
| Tier3 | Specific to LHC project Tier 3 Sites |
| General | General documents and documents about documentation itself |

---++ Document Templates
---++ Document Formatting
Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:
---+++ Screen View
For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a "screen" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
---+++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a "file" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
