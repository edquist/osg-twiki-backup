---++ The Documentation Process
The overall documentation process is described in this section.  This includes information on how Owners, Reviewers, and Testers control the creation, review, and update of documents.  
%INCLUDE{"DocProcess"}%

---++ Classifications and Templates Used for Documents
Documents are classified by type of document, target audience, and document area. 

---+++ Document Types
Documents can be of several different types.  Types are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_TYPE.  The Templates are recommended formatting and sections to be included in the associated document type.
| *Document Type* | *Definition* | *Template* |
| !HowTo | A procedure telling how to do something | Documentation/DocumentationTeam.DocHowToTemplate |
| Installation | A specific procedural document for installation of software | ReleaseDocumentation.DocInstallTemplate |
| Navigation | A document designed to help a person navigate to other documents | |
| Planning | A document used for planning.  E.g. Planning an OSG site. | |
| Knowledge | Any document not of another type.  E.g. general information, explanation, description. | |
| Training | A document designed for training or used organize or manage a training event | |
| Troubleshooting | A troubleshooting document | Documentation/DocumentationTeam.DocTroubleshootingTemplate |

---+++ Document User Roles
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be used by people in another role (called the secondary role).  Since few documents cover multiple roles, we do not specify a secondary role in a document.  Roles are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_ROLE.
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| !EndUser | A user of the the Grid |
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training specifically written for another role would be classified as that role as primary and student as secondary. |
| !SysAdmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOManager | A manager in a Virtual Organization as contrasted with one of the above roles |
| Developer | Any software developer |
| Documenter | Any person working on documentation itself |

---+++ Document Areas
The documentation universe is segmented into a set of areas, each of which has an owner having overall responsibility for the documentation of that area.  The Areas are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_AREA.
| *Documentation Area* | *Definition* | *Area Owner* |
| !ComputeElement | Compute Element | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| Storage | Storage Element or Storage | Main.TanyaLevshina |
| VO | Virtual Organization | Main.AbhishekSinghRana |
| Security | Security | Main.MineAltunay |
| !EndUser | End User of OSG resources.  E.g. Typically a Scientist or Student | Main.BrianBockelman |
| Monitoring | Monitoring, Accounting, and Metrics | Main.BrianBockelman |
| Integration | Related to an OSG release or for the Integration Team | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| Operations | Operational procedures or related to GOC services | Main.RobQ |
| Tier3 | Specific to LHC project Tier 3 Sites | Main.MarcoMambelli |
| General | General documents and documents about documentation itself | Main.RobertEngel |

---+++ Comments
| Could you put the corresponding HTML variable here for easy reference. %RED%OK, added comment and link to variables for each of the tables.%ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:36 |
| Haven&#39;t we changed the Student role to End User? %RED%Yes, I updated the roles and also fixed an inconsistencies in the other 2 tables.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:37 |
| A comment on other pages, not this one: many release documents have installation and troubleshooting on the same page. %RED%True and that is OK.  The document type of a combined document is that of the primary type, in this case, Installation.  In addition there are some stand alone Troubleshooting documents that will use the Troubleshooting Type | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:06 |
| Should we not use the same phrase &#34;End User&#34;, or such, in Document Areas as in Document User Roles, since it is already so close? %RED%Yes, we should.  I fixed the tables and asked Robert to fix the HTML and Homepage search drop downs to be consistent.%ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:17 |

---++ Content Management Control Variables and Tracking
The OSG Release Process includes a set of variables that should be used in all documents that refer to the items represented by those variables.  In addition, the OSG process of creation, update, review, and testing of documents is managed through the use of 
a set of variables at the beginning of each page.  Finally, there is a set of command-like variables that allow you to easily create status tables for documents of interest to you.  These variables are described in the following sections.

#ContentManagementVariables

%TWISTY%
%INCLUDE{"DocManagementVariables"}%
%ENDTWISTY%

---+++ Release Variables

---++ Responsibilities
The responsibilities for the Document Owners, Reviewers, and Testers are explained in the following sections.

---+++ Document Owner Responsibilities
Each document in the Official OSG Documentation TWiki must have an Owner.  Document Owners should also be familiar with the responsibilities of the Reviewers and Testers.
%BR%%BR%
The owner of a document should have knowledge about the topic of the document and is responsible for:
   1. Creating the document (if it doesn't exist).
   1. Inserting and updating the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management Variables]] in the HTML block
   1. Testing or ensuring that testing is done on the software and version the document applies to.
   1. Updating the document when:
      a. Errors are discovered (by document users or the Integration Team).
      a. Users make comments in the document noting problems or improvements needed.
      a. Software or other changes make the document out of date.
      a. New OSG releases require a change in the document.
      a. The document is identified by the Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process as needing improvement (up to 2 times a year).
   1. Working in collaboration with the Reviewer of the document to resolve issues identified by the Reviewer after each significant update.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Tester of the document to resolve issues from a test of procedures (if applicable).
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Owner.

---+++ Document Reviewer Responsibilities
Most documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki have a Reviewer.
%BR%%BR%
The reviewer of a document should have knowledge about standards and format for the type of document being reviewed and is responsible for:
   1. Performing a review (when the Owner marks the document as REVIEW_READY and REVIEW_PASSED is IN_PROGRESS) and correcting or noting issues (via email or the document Comment block) for the Owner.  The review should verify that the document:
      a. Contains the relevant sections specified in the template for the relevant document type.
      a. Sections and content conform to the formatting standards for the relevant document type (e.g. see DocFormattingRules).
      a. Is clearly written and can be understood by a reader with varying levels of expertise.
      a. Has or refers to a diagram of the appropriate architecture (if applicable).
      a. Is technically accurate and complete (the Reviewer is not responsible for actually testing a procedure).
      a. Contains no typos or wording errors.
   1. Updating the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] REVIEW_PASSED variable.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner to ensure the issues you identify are resolved in the document.
   1. Doing a final review when you, the Tester, and the Owner agree it is complete and updating the REVIEW_PASSED variable.
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Reviewer.

---+++ Document Tester Responsibilities
Procedural documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki should have a Tester.
%BR%%BR%
Each installation or procedure document in the OSG Documentation TWiki should be tested. The purpose of the test is to check if the documented procedures yield expected results when carried out. A document needs to be tested:
   1. After it has been created.
   1. After major changes to the document have been made.
   1. Before major releases.%BR%
The Tester should preferably be a person that is not:
   1. The developer of the software or procedure described in the document.
   1. The owner of the document.%BR%
The Tester of a document should only have a general knowledge about the topic of the document. To follow the instructions of the document, the tester must have access to facilities needed for the test (e.g. a local site resource or ITB resource). The Tester is responsible for:
   1. Performing a test (when the Owner marks the document TEST_READY and TEST_PASSED is IN_PROGRESS) of the instructions on the software and version the document is meant to be used with and noting any problems or anomalies.
   1. Updating the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] TEST_PASSED variable.
   1. Working in collaboration with the Owner of the document to resolve issues from a test of procedures.
   1. Doing a final test (if necessary) after the issues are resolved to verify the procedure presented the document can be performed successfully and updating TEST_PASSED variable.
   1. Notifying the Document Architect if unable to continue to fulfill the responsibilities of the Tester.
%NOTE%  The roles of the Reviewer and Tester are different!  The Reviewer is only responsible to check documents for their readability, logical structure, and conformance to standards, while the Tester must apply the procedures as described in the document.

| Need a period at the end of every bullet point. %RED%Yes, Done.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 21:06 |
| &#34;The review should verify that the document: &#34; %RED%Yes, Done.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 21:12 |
| Add responsibility of Owner to create correct HTML block and others to update it appropriately. %RED%Yes, Done.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 21:14 |
| The test should not have to be done on an ITB site, should it? There are limited ITB resources. ITB resources are not available to all who may be testers.  ITB has its own test plan and there are many procedures documented that are not part of ITB testing. %RED%True, changed it to use ITB as a (second) example.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 21:19 |
