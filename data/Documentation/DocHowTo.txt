Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:
---+++ Screen View
For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a "screen" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
---+++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a "file" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
