Documents can be of several different types.  The following table defines the types and gives links to to the associated Template documents:
| *Document Type* | *Definition* | *Template* |
| Howto | A procedure telling how to do something | |
| Installation | A specific procedural document for installation of software | DocInstallTemplate |
| Navigation | A document designed to help a person navigate to other documents | |

| Knowledge | Any document not of another type.  E.g. general information, explanation, description. | |
| Training | A document designed for training | |
| Troubleshooting | A troubleshooting document | |
---+++ Document User Roles
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be expected to be used by people in other role(s) (called secondary role).  Those roles are defined by:
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| Scientist | A user of the the Grid, sometimes called an End User |
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training specifically written for another role would be classified as that role as primary and student as secondary. |
| Sysadmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOmanager | A manager in a Virtual Organization as contrasted with one of the above roles |
| Developer | Any software developer |
