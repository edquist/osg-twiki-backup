%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
This  page provides  details for site admins installing, upgrading or  using  perfSONAR  in  WLCG/OSG.     The sections  below are intended to allow users  to  find  quickly the  specific information they are  interested in. 

One  *strong recommendation*  we have for  anyone  maintaining  or using  perfSONAR  is that  they join either or  both  of  the following  mailing lists:
   * *User's Mailing List*  The perfSONAR project maintains a mailing list for communication on matters of installation, configuration, bug reports, or general performance discussions:  https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-user
   * *Announcement Mailing List* The perfSONAR project also maintains a low volume mailing list used for announcements related to software updates and vulnerabilities: https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-announce

Below  are  perfSONAR topical sections:
   * [[IntegrationPS][Integration (new sites) – requirements, procedure]]
   * [[InstallUpdatePS][Installation/upgrade guide]]
   * [[TroubleFAQPS][Troubleshooting/FAQ]]
   * [[ExGuidePS][Guide for experiments (storage APIs, dashboard, etc.)]]
