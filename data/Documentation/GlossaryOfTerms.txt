   $ CE<a name="DefsCe"></a>: _See_ Compute Element.
   $ cern wrapper<a name="DefsCernWrapper"></a>: A [[#DefsFileFamilyWrapper][file family wrapper]] that accommodates data files up to (10<sup>21</sup> &#8211; 1) bytes. It matches an extension to the ANSI standard, as proposed by CERN, and allows data files written at Fermilab to be readable by CERN, and vice-versa. See file family wrapper. 
   $ collective layer<a name="DefsCollectiveLayer"></a>: fourth of five layers to support grid applications. Includes [[#DefsReplicaCatalog][Replica Catalog]], [[#DefsReplicaSelection][Replica Selection]], [[#DefsRequestPlanning][Request Planning]], [[#DefsRequestExecution][Request Execution]].
   $ Compute Element<a name="DefsComputeElement"></a>: An element capable of running a user job.
   $ configuration server (CS)<a name="DefsConfigurationServer"></a>: Maintains and distributes the information about Enstore system configuration, such as the location and parameters of each Enstore component and/or server. 
   $ connectivity layer<a name="DefsConnectivity"></a>: second of five layers to support grid applications. Includes communication, authorization, delegation, etc.
   $ cpio_odc wrapper: A [[#DefsFileFamilyWrapper][file family wrapper]] which allows the file to be dumpable via cpio. This wrapper has a file length limit of (8G &#8211; 1) bytes. _See also:_ file family wrapper. 
   $ crc (Cyclic Redundancy Check)<a name="DefsCrc"></a>: Used to verify that data has been stored properly. It is used like a checksum, but is less prone to multiple-bit errors. During a transfer, both sides calculate the crc and compare the values, unless the --no-crc option is specified. Enstore uses a zero seededAdler 32 crc. 
   $ cwd<a name="DefsCwd"></a>: current working directory

#DefsLl

   $ layer<a name="DefsLayer"></a>: Pnfs stores metadata about each file in &#8220;layers&#8221;, each layer containing a specific type of metadata. Each stored data file has its own set of these layers. Currently, only layers 1 and 4 are used. 
   $ library<a name="DefsLibrary"></a>: (Enstore) The collection of storage media and devices that includes physical data storage media, robotic devices and drives. An Enstore library is typically called a _robot_. 
   $ library manager (LM)<a name="DefsLibraryManager"></a>: A server that controls a virtual library. LMs receive requests for file copies from users via encp and they distribute the requests to the Movers. 
   $ LM<a name="DefsLm"></a>: _See_ library manager.
   $ log server (LS)<a name="DefsLogServer"></a>: Receives messages from other processes and logs them into formatted log files that are available online. 
   $ logical networking (LN)<a name="DefsLogicalNetworking"></a>: Builds on a highly generic storage service that uses the [[#DefsInternetBackplaneProtocol][Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP)]] which it deploys on storages services called _depots_.

   $ Network Weather Service<a name="DefsNetworkWeatherService"></a>: Provides an estimate of the current (and near future?) network availability.

   $ pinning (files)<a name="DefsPinning"></a>: Request that a file remain in place at a site until it is released. Used for grid file transfers, either pinning a file at the source for movement or pinning it at the target until used and released.
   $ pnfs layer<a name="DefsPfnsLayer"></a>: _See_ layer. 
   $ pnfs<a name="DefsPfns"></a>: An independent namespace package written at DESY. It presents a collection of library database entries as a UNIX-like file system, and thus allows users to browse stored files as though they reside in this file system. Pnfs is mounted like NFS, but it is a virtual file system only. It maintains file grouping and structure information via a set of tags in each directory. 
   $ pnfs tags<a name="DefsPfnsTags"></a>: _See_ tags. 
   $ pool<a name="DefsPool"></a>: dCache data server node
   $ pool attraction scheme<a name="DefsPoolAttractionScheme"></a>: 
   $ POSIX I/O<a name="DefsPosixIo"></a>: POSIX standards for I/O. POSIX is "a set of IEEE standards designed to provide application portability between Unix variants." (From [[http://foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?POSIX][FOLDOC]] )

   $ tags<a name="DefsTags"></a>: _Also_ tag files. Pnfs uses tag in the /pnfs namespace to specify file-specific configuration information. Encp transfers this information to Enstore. Tags are associated with directories in the /pnfs namespace, not with any specific file, and thus apply to all files within a given directory. 
   $ Tape Resource Manager<a name="DefsTapeResourceManager"></a>: An SRM that manages access to a tape archiving system. _See also:_ DRM; SRM; HRM.
   $ Tape Storage Systems<a name="DefsTapeStorageSystems"></a>: Tertiary storage of magnetic media.
   $ tertiary storage<a name="DefsTertiaryStorage"></a>: "A computer storage system consisting of one or more storage drives and an automatic media library, for example a tape library or optical disc jukebox. Tertiary storage is used for archival of rarely accessed information, since it is much slower than secondary storage...." [From [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_storage][Wikipedia]])
   $ Tertiary Storage Manager (TSM)<a name="DefsTertiaryStorageManager"></a>: *TBD*
   $ TRM<a name="DefsTrm"></a>: _See_ Tape Resource Manager.

   $ VC<a name="DefsVc"></a>: _See_ Volume Clerk.
   $ virtual library<a name="DefsVirtualLibrary"></a>: A subset of an Enstore data storage library. It can contain one and only one type of media. It is paired with its own library manager which controls it. 
   $ Virtual Organization<a name="DefsVirtualOrganization"></a>: The group that "buys in" to the OSG, generally for a large project. Every user runs as a member of a virtual organization, who issues their certificat

   $ volume: _See_ [[#DefsStorageVolume][storage volume]]. 
   $ volume assert<a name="DefsVolumeAssert"></a>: An administrative task in which a storage volume is mounted and only certain attributes are read in order to check that the volume is in working condition. Assigned the lowest priority. 
   $ volume clerk (VC)<a name="DefsVolumeClerk"></a>: A server that stores and administers storage volume (tape) information. 
   $ volume family<a name="DefsVolumeFamily"></a>: storage group + file family + file family wrapper. In order for different data files to be stored on the same volume, all three of these pnfs tags for the files must match.
