   $ cern wrapper: A file family wrapper that accommodates data files up to (10<sup>21</sup> &#8211; 1) bytes. It matches an extension to the ANSI standard, as proposed by CERN, and allows data files written at Fermilab to be readable by CERN, and vice-versa. See file family wrapper.

   $ configuration server (CS): The Configuration Server maintains and distributes the information about Enstore system configuration, such as the location and parameters of each Enstore component and/or server. 
   $ cpio_odc wrapper: A file family wrapper which allows the file to be dumpable via cpio. This wrapper has a file length limit of (8G &#8211; 1) bytes. _See also:_ file family wrapper. 
   $ crc (Cyclic Redundancy Check): Used to verify that data has been stored properly. It is used like a checksum, but is less prone to multiple-bit errors. During a transfer, both sides calculate the crc and compare the values, unless the --no-crc option is specified. Enstore uses a zero seededAdler 32 crc.
