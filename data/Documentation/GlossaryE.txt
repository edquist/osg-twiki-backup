   $ ecrc<a name="DefsEcrc"></a>: "Enstore CRC". Ecrc is a command packaged with encp which calculates the crc of a local file. _See also:_ crc.
   $ en_check<a name="DefsEnCheck"></a>: A command packaged with encp that determines if a file is on tape. 
   $ encp<a name="DefsEncp"></a>: A deprecated end-user command (designed for Enstore) used to copy data files to and from disk and storage media.  Encp also includes three diagnostic tools: ecrc, ddencp, en_check. 
   $ Enstore<a name="DefsEnstore"></a>: The mass storage system implemented at Fermilab as the primary data store for experiments&#8217; data sets. It provides distributed access to data on tape or other storage media both locally and over networks. 
   $ enstore.conf<a name="DefsEnstoreConf"></a>: A configuration file to allow for multiple network interface cards dedicated to Enstore, and to map the interfaces to routers. The default location for the file is /etc/enstore.conf. The location of the file can be overridden with the environment variable ENSTORE_CONF. 
   $ ENSTORE_CONF: Environment variable that can be used to override the location of the enstore.conf file. See enstore.conf. 
   $ ENSTORE_CONFIG_HOST: An environment variable which points to the Enstore server that is running the configuration server 
   $ ENSTORE_CONFIG_PORT: An environment variable which sets the port number; the value is (by convention) 7500 for all installations at Fermilab. 
   $ ensync<a name="DefsEnsync"></a>: A wrapper for encp that allows you to copy the contents of an entire directory structure to Enstore via a single command. 
   $ event relay (ER)<a name="DefsEventRelay"></a>: A server that forwards messages based on subscription. All the Enstore servers send messages to the ER. Any server may &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to the ER in order to have messages of particular types forwarded to it.
