Discusses the ways in which the audience and task analyses influence the design of the documents, and how the documentation sets will work together.

---++ DELIVERY AND MEDIA
All documentation will be delivered electronically.

All of the documentation must be available on the OSG TWiki and most of it should be written in it. Certain documents, such as presentations or reports, will have to be posted to the TWiki rather than native to that format.

However, users may use the TWiki-2-PDF converter to create printable documents. Researchers and scientists using the storage elements will be most like to print documentation.

---++ Document Types
---++ TYPES OF DOCUMENTS
a13 1
The set should include the following documentation types:
   $ *Quick Reference Guide*: a printed or printable sheet with shorthand tips for installing or doing certain administrative tasks.
   $ *Task-oriented user guides*: All systems administrators will need task-oriented documentation. Until the &#8220;blind to user&#8221; facilities are built into the OSG, researchers will also need task-oriented documentation telling them how to connect to the storage elements.
   $ *Marketing Materials*: Some of the storage-related documents are to help influence decision-makers to either join and use the OSG or to make storage available to OSG members.
   $ *About OSG Storage*: Conceptual information to explain how things fit together. This may include Process Diagrams to show information and process flows among the various parts of the Grid.

Discuss the ways in which the audience and task analyses influence the design of the documents. 
   * What is the proper information to be in each volume of the set? How should that information be presented within that volume? 
   * Is there a need for quick reference guides, reference manuals, task-oriented user manuals? 
   * Are some concepts so esoteric that users will require a purely conceptual piece? 
   * Should on manual contain a combination of one or more aforementioned types?

Discuss how the documents in the set will work together:
   * Does the library address all of the audience task needs identified in the analyses?
   * How will the information be provided?
