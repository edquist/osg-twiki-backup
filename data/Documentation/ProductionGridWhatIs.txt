---+ In the OSG, what is the Production Grid?

The production grid consists of a distributed facility providing access for OSG users to stable processing and data storage resources through the network fabric. Resources and Services are statically registered on the production grid, and the status of these resources is shown in the [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi?grid=1][VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Resource Selector (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS)]].


A fundamental piece of the OSG infrastructure is the service catalogs,
which list services available on the OSG and links to information
about them. Catalog tools are under development and several are
in use. For each standard OSG service, there is one primary
catalog designated. A common catalog system is a goal for a future
release of OSG. Catalogs in use include:
<noautolink>
   * [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi?grid=1][VO Resource Selector (VORS)]]. Applications can query VORS for a list of CEs and the status of the most recent service test. Applications are expected to use this interface to get the most current list of CEs.There is also a [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/tindex.cgi?grid=1][a text interface]] which can be queried; see the [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/documentation/index.html][VORS documentation]] for more details on this facility.
   * The VO Membership Service (VOMS) Catalog.
   * Clarens Discovery Service is a dynamic catalog for Web Services interfaces to OSG services.

For more information, and in particular, for a diagram that  illustrates the process of moving a service from [[IntegrationGridWhatIs][integration]] to production, see "Production vs. Integration Grid" on the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000080][Grid Architecture page]].

OSG production operations are distributed across the various Support
Centers. If you are affiliated with a Virtual Organization (VO),
contact the Support Center [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo.WebHome][for your VO]] for reporting and resolving
operations issues.
