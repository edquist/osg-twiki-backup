---+ Communication team's proposed new link structure for home page redesign Nov 07
---++ Plan for making changes to osg test site


   1. make/fix 3  top level (grey) pages; delete others
   3. Go thru 1-by-1 relocating/adding/changing/deleting each page as necessary; Marcia work top down, Anne work bottom up; according to NEW structure
   2. Change specifics on Tools for collaborators so they fit in regular structure
   4. Identify missing content and content that needs updating

Things that come up:
Anne
   * mission- not index page %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%

Anne to ask:
   * New page: facilities, sites and resources needs content %RED%--done, needs review%ENDCOLOR%
   * architecture -- needs update -- priority? %RED%--done, needs review%ENDCOLOR%
   * outreach page needs work %RED%--done, needs review by Sebastien and John%ENDCOLOR%

For Ruth
   * Members and partners page needs review. 
   * Activities page -- no integration mentioned -- ruth wants removed???
   * Resource monitoring -- ruth volunteered to update
   * currently running apps -- still monalisa image --ok?
   * date for year 1 report

   * what is grid comp -- add isgtw link %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * link to org chart from management page not working %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * research highlights --no 2nd level menu; move "year 1 report" to News (and docdb if not yet there) %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * add title on ref material page %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * Ref > doc repository -- link directly to docdb %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * reconcile title of Documentation vs user and admin doc..... (under ref material) %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * under ref doc -- software link bad -- is it needed here? NO  plus it has babies, move to under other sw link %RED%--done%ENDCOLOR%
   * Images needs update 
   * image on "research on osg" (or new title) needs update
   * Brochures needs update


   * can't find osg sw stack page, to go under osg@work > sw


To do then:
   * check all intra-web links

---++ Top level links
Shown here in tabular format (breakdown of sublinks is in next section).  We're looking at having three groupings of top-level links: About OSG, OSG at Work, Information & help.  

Notes: from Alina: separate "OSG in the news" from "news from OSG"
