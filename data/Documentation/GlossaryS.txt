   $ SAML<a name="DefsSaml"></a>: Security Assertion Markup Language.
   $ SAZ<a name="DefsSaz"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsSiteAuthorizationService][Site AuthoriZation service]]
   $ SE: _See_ [[#DefsStorageElement][Storage Element]].
   $ SIMD: _See_ [[#DefsSimd][Single Instruction, Multiple Data]]
   $ Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)<a name="DefsSimd"></a>: Domain decomposition. Parallel processing where each processor is assigned a different part of the data. [[#DEJ06]]
   $ Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD)<a name="DefsSisd"></a>: Serial processing of a problem in a computer. 
   $ SISD: _See_ [[#DefsSisd][Single Instruction, Single Data]].
   $ site<a name="DefsSite"></a>: a physical location containing one more [[#DefsComputerElement][Compute Elements]] or [[#DefsStorageElement][Storage Elements]]. Contrast to [[#DefsVirtualOrganization][Virtual Organization]].
   $ Site Authorization Service (SAZ)<a name="DefsSiteAuthorizationService"></a>: allows security authorities of the grid site to impose sitewide policy and to control access to the site; allows administrators to control user access to the site resources; and, provides means to retrieve  the information about users and their access.
   $ Site URL<a name="DefsSiteUrl"></a>: URL known externally (i.e., in Replica Catalogs). Single SURL can map to multiple TURLs. _See also:_ [[#DefsTransferUrl][transfer URL]].
   $ SRM: _See_ [[#DefsStorageResourceManager][Storage Resource Manager]]. 
   $ Storage Element<a name="DefsStorageElement"></a>: The interface through which Grid components communicate with a storage unit that has 1) protocol for local data access protocol; 2) protocol for secure wide-area transfer; 3) exposes status of availability and space; and 4) includes an [[GlossaryOfTerms#Srm][SRM]] interface. The SE is a sufficiently flexible interface to grid storage units that allows interoperability of the grid [[#DefsTierSystem][Tier System]] without forcing local sites to change their existing software stack. 
   $ storage group<a name="DefsStorageGroup"></a>: An identifier corresponding to an experiment that Enstore uses as it controls and balances assignment of resources such as tape drives and media. Each storage group (i.e., each experiment) is assigned an area in [[#DefsPnfs][pnfs]]. 
   $ Storage Resource Manager (SRM)<a name="DefsStorageResourceManagement"></a>: middleware components that manage shared storage resources on the Grid and provide: uniform access to heterogeneous storage; ftp negotiation; dynamic [[#DefsTurl][TURL allocation]]; access to permanent and temporary types of storage; advanced space and file reservation; and, reliable transfer services. _See also:_ [[#DefsDrm][DRM]], [[#DefsTrm][TRM]]; [[#DefsHrm][HRM]].
   $ storage scheduling and data placement services<a name="DefsStorageScheduling"></a>: Services that negotiate space reservation and schedule data movement by requesting such services from multiple SRMs. 
   $ storage volume<a name="DefsStorageVolume"></a>: A unit of mass storage, e.g., a tape. 
   $ streaming (of files on tape)<a name="DefsStreaming"></a>: The sequential access of adjacent files on tape at the maximum tape read/write speeds. 
   $ striping (of files on tape)<a name="DefsStriping"></a>: Spllitting single files onto two or more volumes, each writing simultaneously, in order to expedite the writing process. 
   $ submit machine<a name="DefsSubmitMachine"></a>: the computer from which a [[#DefsJob][job]] has been submitted.
   $ SURL (_or_ sURL)<a name="DefsSurl"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsSiteUrl][site URL]].
   $ suspect volume<a name="DefsSuspectVolume"></a>: A potentially faulty storage medium. A volume becomes "suspect" when a mover communicates to the appropriate library manager that it had a problem with the volume.
