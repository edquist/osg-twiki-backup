   $ SA: _See_ [[#DefsStorageArea][Storage Area]].
   $ SAML<a name="DefsSaml"></a>: Security Assertion Markup Language.
   $ SAZ<a name="DefsSaz"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsSiteAuthorizationService][Site AuthoriZation service]]
   $ Schema: a schema refers to a description of objects and attributes needs to describe Grid resources, and the relationships between the objects.

   $ SE: _See_ [[#DefsStorageElement][Storage Element]].
   $ Service: A method for accessing a Resource or Agent.
   $ Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)<a name="DefsSimd"></a>: Domain decomposition. Parallel processing where each processor is assigned a different part of the data. [[#DEJ06]]
   $ Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD)<a name="DefsSisd"></a>: Serial processing of a problem in a computer. 
   $ SISD: _See_ [[#DefsSisd][Single Instruction, Single Data]].
   $ Site<a name="DefsSite"></a>: A site is a logical name denoting a concrete, persistent, uniquely identifiable, and testable collection of Services, Providers and Resources for administrative purposes. A Facility is a collection of Sites under a single administrative domain. A site offers computing services, persistent storage services, or both.A site offering computing services is uniquely identified by a single gatekeeper service (hostname and port) and a single gsiftp service (hostname and port). Multiple sites at a facility may share certain services at that facility.
   $ Site Authorization Service (SAZ)<a name="DefsSiteAuthorizationService"></a>: allows security authorities of the grid site to impose sitewide policy and to control access to the site; allows administrators to control user access to the site resources; and, provides means to retrieve  the information about users and their access.
   $ SPD SRM Parallel Depot: an integration of the Storage Resource Manager (SRM) with a technology for wide area data management, Logistical Networking (LN), which is now being used by several important OSG application communities (see Logistical Networking). The strategy of combining SRM with IBP-based depots is designed to provide an interoperable foundation for wide area storage infrastructure that can address the problems of in-transit data management through a familiar interface, but with maximum flexibility and performance.
   $ Squid: Squid is a web caching service that speeds up downloads from http servers by locally caching files and serving the cached files rather than retrieving the files over the internet. Also referred to as a proxy, the typical use case would be for squid to be installed on a single server on a cluster with CE nodes using that server to proxy http and https requests.
   $ SRM: _See_ [[#DefsStorageResourceManager][Storage Resource Manager]]. 
   $ SRM-dCache: An implementation of SRM as a "door" into dCache.
   $ Storage Area<a name="DefsStorageArea"></a>: The storage area is a logical portion of storage extent assigned to a VO. Storage areas can overlap the same physical space, thus having contention over the free space among different VO’s [GLUE13]. 
   $ Storage Element<a name="DefsStorageElement"></a>: The group of services responsible for a storage resource on the Grid. Services may include data access (e.g. protocol for local data access, protocol for secure wide-area transfer), quota management or space management (providing the space available and allowing space reservation). Storage resources contributed to a Grid system can vary from simple disk servers managed via [[#DefGridFtp][<nop>GridFTP]] to complex massive storage systems managed via [[#Srm][SRM]]. The SE is a sufficiently flexible interface to grid storage units that allows interoperability of the grid [[#DefsTierSystem][Tier System]] without forcing local sites to change their existing software stack. 
<!--
   $ Storage Element<a name="DefsStorageElement"></a>: The interface through which Grid components communicate with a storage unit that has 1) protocol for local data access; 2) protocol for secure wide-area transfer; 3) exposes status of availability and space; and 4) includes an [[GlossaryOfTerms#Srm][SRM]] interface. The SE is a sufficiently flexible interface to grid storage units that allows interoperability of the grid [[#DefsTierSystem][Tier System]] without forcing local sites to change their existing software stack. 
-->
   $ Storage Resource Manager (SRM)<a name="DefsStorageResourceManagement"></a>: middleware components that manage shared storage resources on the Grid and provide: uniform access to heterogeneous storage; ftp negotiation; dynamic [[#DefsTurl][TURL allocation]]; access to permanent and temporary types of storage; advanced space and file reservation; and, reliable transfer services. _See also:_ [[#DefsDrm][DRM]], [[#DefsTrm][TRM]]; [[#DefsHrm][HRM]].
   $ Subcluster: In the GLUE schema, a subcluster represents a "homogeneous" collection of nodes, where the homogeneity is defined by a collection whose required node attributes all have the same value. For example, a subcluster represents a set of nodes with the same CPU, memory, OS, network interfaces, etc. Subclusters provide a convenient way of representing useful collections of nodes.
   $ Submit machine<a name="DefsSubmitMachine"></a>: the computer from which a job has been submitted.
   $ SURL (_or_ sURL)<a name="DefsSurl"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsSiteUrl][site URL]].
   
<!--
   $ SIMD: _See_ [[#DefsSimd][Single Instruction, Multiple Data]]
   $ Site URL<a name="DefsSiteUrl"></a>: URL known externally (i.e., in Replica Catalogs). Single SURL can map to multiple TURLs. _See also:_ [[#DefsTransferUrl][transfer URL]].
   $ storage group<a name="DefsStorageGroup"></a>: An identifier corresponding to an experiment that Enstore uses as it controls and balances assignment of resources such as tape drives and media. Each storage group (i.e., each experiment) is assigned an area in [[#DefsPnfs][pnfs]]. 
   $ storage scheduling and data placement services<a name="DefsStorageScheduling"></a>: Services that negotiate space reservation and schedule data movement by requesting such services from multiple SRMs. 
   $ storage volume<a name="DefsStorageVolume"></a>: A unit of mass storage, e.g., a tape. 
   $ streaming (of files on tape)<a name="DefsStreaming"></a>: The sequential access of adjacent files on tape at the maximum tape read/write speeds. 
   $ striping (of files on tape)<a name="DefsStriping"></a>: Spllitting single files onto two or more volumes, each writing simultaneously, in order to expedite the writing process. 
   $ suspect volume<a name="DefsSuspectVolume"></a>: A potentially faulty storage medium. A volume becomes "suspect" when a mover communicates to the appropriate library manager that it had a problem with the volume.
