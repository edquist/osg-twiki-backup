---+++ Introduction

There are three interrelated processes that involve documentation:
   1. Ownership/Review Process
   1. Testing/New Release Process
   1. Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process

Each of these are straightforward and take into account the low resource, collaborative environment of OSG.
The first and third of these processes are owned by the Content Management Area Coordinator who is responsible for maintaining the process descriptions, 
changing the processes as needed, and managing the execution of the processes.
The second process is owned and managed by the OSG Integration & Sites Coordinator.

---+++ Ownership/Review Process
Documents are separated into a set of areas, each with an owner that has overall responsibility for that area.  The area owner manages the structure of the areas documentation and ensures the documents have the following roles assigned.
Each document in the OSG Documentation TWiki must have an Owner who is responsible for creation and/or maintenance/update of that document.
The Owner is named within the document using the OWNER variable.
The responsibilities of the Owner are given in DocOwnerResponsibilities.

Each document must also have a Reviewer who is responsible for reviewing the document for content, accuracy, usability, and format.
The Reviewer is named within the document using the REVIEWER variable.
The responsibilities of the Reviewer are given in DocReviewerResponsibilities.

Documents that include procedures to be followed by the readers also have a Tester who is responsible for testing the procedure to verify that it produces the expected results.  The Tester is named within the document using the TESTER variable.  The Tester responsibilities are given in DocTesterResponsibilities.

The steps in the Ownership/Review Process apply to all documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki
(currently Documentation.WebHome and ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome).  
They are:
   1. For any new or existing document (that is not being eliminated), an Owner and Reviewer are identified.  These assignments can be proposed by the Area Owner, made by a person volunteering to take the role (preferred), by local management selection, or  by the Area Owner and/or the Content Management Area Coordinator working in conjunction with the person and the person's local management.
   1. The Owner produces or makes the existing document conform to the standards/template (ReleaseDocumentation.FormattingRules) and marks the REVIEW_READY variable to %TRUE%.
   1. The Reviewer reviews the document and marks the variable REVIEW_PASSED either %REVIEWED%, then works in collaboration with the Owner to resolve issues with the document until the Reviewer is ready to mark the REVIEW_PASSED variable %TRUE%.
      a. If the document is a procedure or installation document, the Reviewer will mark the TEST_READY variable %TRUE%. (The TEST_PASSED variable should be %UNDEF%.)
      a. The Tester will perform the test, document any problems, and mark the variable TEST_PASSED to %FALSE% (or %TRUE%).
      a. If the test failed, the Tester will collaborate with the Owner to resolve any issues discovered by the testing.  When resolved the Tester will mark the variable TEST_PASSED to %TRUE%.
   1. When the Review and Owner are satisfied with the document, the Reviewer mark the RELEASE_READY variable to %TRUE%.

The list of documents and their owners and reviewers and document status is automatically maintained by the in tables that can be created using TWiki variables.  These tables can be generated at the document Area level, the individual level (all documents the person has a role in), or the Release level (all official documents).

---+++ Testing/New Release Process

This process applies to all documents in the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][ReleaseDocumentation Web]].  When a new release of the OSG software is being integrated, documented, and tested, the Integration & Sites Coordinator manages the process represented by ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome.
That process uses the Owner, Reviewer, and Tester consistent with the Ownership/Review process above.  The management of documents for major and minor releases is detailed in DocReleaseProcess.

---+++ Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process

This process covers the ongoing evaluation and improvement of OSG documentation.  It makes use of user feedback in the form of comments and a document rating mechanism to identify documents or document areas in need of improvement.  In addition the Document Architect ([[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=889][OSG DocDB #889]]) and Content Management Area Coordinator may review messages in mailing lists and other information to identify areas needing improvement.

On a quarterly basis, a set of documents will be identified for improvement.  The Owner and Reviewer for each of these will be asked to make improvements that will be tracked by the Document Architect.  At the same time particularly well rated documents will be identified to use as examples of high-quality documents.  Once a year, the best of our documents will be identified and their Owners and Reviewers will be recognized.
