---+!! %SPACEOUT{ "The OSG FAQ" }%

OSG started to develop a knowledge base, and for various reasons has chosen to abandon it. However, much of the information we collected is very useful. It has been largely turned into twiki topics and linked into the documentation as appropriate. We present the topics also in the form of a FAQ in case you find that easier.

---++ End user topics
   * In the OSG, what services are available? (need somebody to write; can we update the http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Getting_Started/Software page and make it "software and services"?)
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInfo][How do I install and use the Pacman software packaging tool?]]
   * [[Documentation/JobHowToRun][How do I run a grid job using OSG?]] I think this is obsolete; answer is VO-specific; for the "OSG" VO, point to the [[GridUsersGuide]];  Do we need to start at [[JoinToUseResources]] (user guide points to it; maybe reconcile with getting started page)
   * [[CondorScriptSamples][What does a Condor submission script look like?]] Needs review
   * [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Main/HomePage][Where can I get more information about the GLUE schema used in OSG?]] Right link?
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders#Introduction][Where can I get more information about Generic Information Providers (GIPs)?]] (it points to an OSG-GIP page in the intro, and the link is bad)
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation?/ClientInstallationGuide][How do I install the OSG client for use on my desktop?]] 
   * [[TroubleshootJobHowTo][How do I troubleshoot my job if it does not run properly?]] needs review

   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInfo][How do I install and use the Pacman software packaging tool?]] 
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/OSGResourceName][What should I name my OSG resource?]]  <!-- Documentation/Trash.DocumentationCEResourceNaming needs mentions gridcat -->
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/CEInstallGuide][How do I install OSG-(latest version) on my compute element?]]
   * [[Documentation/Trash.DocumentationCEAdminWorkerNodePackages][What should I install on the worker nodes of my OSG compute element?]]  needs review

   * [[Documentation/CEAdminConfigStorage][How should I configure storage on my OSG compute element?]] atho
   * [[Documentation/CEAdminLocalStoragePaths][What are the local storage paths on my OSG compute element, and how are they used?]] athi needs review
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/SrmDrm][What is SRM/DRM, and how do I set up a storage element on the OSG using SRM/DRM?]] athk
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/OSGShutdownGuide][What should I do to shut down a previous version of the OSG before I upgrade? (for CE)]] athd (what about client? It's not in ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide)

   * [[Trash.DocumentationCEAdminActivateOnGridCat][How do I activate and deactivate my Resource on the OSG GridCat?? obsolete -- replace with what?]] atjs

---++ Security related topics
   * [[Documentation/CertificateWhatIs][What is a certificate?]] 

   * [[Documentation/CertificateGet][How do I get or renew a PKI Personal Certificate for use with OSG?]] Anybody know if DOEGrids procedure has changed in last 8 mos? Else, AH to review.  Oh, do we want to point to [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-ra/PersonalRequest.php]] instead?
   * [[Documentation/SecurityUserResponsibilities][Users' responsibilities regarding security]] needs review by security team member
   * [[Documentation/SecurityIncidentWhatToDo][What should I do if a security incident occurs on the OSG?]]  I think we should deprecate this twiki page and add sec incident info to Getting_Started/Support.
   * What scripts are available for working with certificates and certificate authorities? (AH can't find kb file)

(I lost something I put in about troubleshooting -- Forrest had another page)
