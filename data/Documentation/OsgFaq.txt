---++ Additional questions
---+++ From general trawling
<dl class="faqList">
	<dt>Where can I get funding to convert my applications to parallelism needed on the OSG?</dt>
	<dd></dd>

	<dt>Who funds the OSG?</dt>
	<dd></dd>

	<dt>Where can I get training on how to use the grid?</dt>
	<dd></dd>
	
	<dt>How do I port my existing application to work on the OSG resources?</dt>

---+++ From the Grid Schools

<dl class="faqList">
	<dt>Can someone reset the password on my key?</dt>
	<dd>No. (link to explanation somewhere of how keys are encrypted)</dd>

	<dt>Can I really run my job on any OSG resource without talking to the site first?</dt>
	<dd>Almost. Once you are in an OSG Virtual Organization (VO), you can run on any site that allows that VO to use it. many sites allow all OSG VOs.</dd>

	<dt>what happens if I run a bazillion squillion jobs on one site?</dt>
	<dd>The site administrator gets angry. It's the same as if you are a normal user at that site and do too much. It might mean that the admin's retribution is visited upon your entire VO  rather than you specifically, though.</dd>

	<dt>What is the difference between gram2 and gram4 (i.e., between globus-job-run and globusrun-ws)?</dt>
	<dd>  </dd>
