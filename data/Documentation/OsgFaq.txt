---++ General Information

<dl class="faq">

	<dt>What is the Open Science Grid (OSG)?</dt>
	<dd>The Open Science Grid brings together a distributed, peta-scale computing and storage resources into a uniform shared cyberinfrastructure for large-scale scientific research. It is built and operated by a consortium of universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers.  [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About][Read more...]]</dd>

	<dt>How do I use the OSG resources?</dt>
	<dd>To [[GettingStarted][get started using the OSG infrastructure]], you must 
		<ol>
			<li>Join a [[VOWhatIs][Virtual Organization]] registered with OSG</li>
			<li>Download and install the OSG client software, or the customized version for your Virtual Organization </li>
			<li>Enable your appllication for grid computing </li>
			<li>Submit your job to a resource available to your Virtual Organization </li>
		</ol>
	[[WebHome][Read more...]]</dd>

	<dt>What services are available in the OSG?</dt>
	<dd>Job submission, data transfer and storage, authentication, accounting, monitoring, central information gathering/publishing, web caching (proxy), and more.     [[Integration/ITB_0_7/OverviewOfServicesInOSG][Read more...]]</dd>

	<dt>Who participates in the OSG?</dt>
	<dd>The Open Science Grid is a collaboration of science researchers, software developers and computing, storage and network providers who come from universities, national laboratories and computing centers. Although based primarily in the United States, the OSG includes participants in other nations. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Who_is_the_Open_Science_Grid%3F][Read more...]]
	<!-- Add this info in, and get rid of  OsgWhoParticipates arrz --> </dd>
			
	<dt>How do I make my site's resources available to OSG members? </dt>
	<dd>OSG encouages new sites. The basic installation of an OSG Compute Element or Storage Element requires that certain sets of hardware be available and configured with the OSG software. You will also need to determine your site's policies for usage. [[GettingStarted][Read more...]] </dd>

	<dt>What is the difference between the Production and Integration Grids?</dt>
	<dd>The production grid is where you run your normal jobs. The integration grid supports developers in preparing the next release of the OSG software stack. [[IntegrationGridWhatIs][Read more about the integration grid...]]    [[ProductionGridWhatIs][Read more about the production grid...]]  </dd>

---++ Virtual Organizations (VO)

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>What is an OSG Virtual Organization (VO)?</dt>
	<dd>A Virtual Organization (VO) is collection of persons. Members of a VO may come from many different home institutions in geographically separate places, may have in common only a general interest or goal (e.g., CMS physics analysis), and may communicate and coordinate their work solely through information technology (hence the term virtual). [[VOWhatIs][Read more...]] </dd>

	<dt>How do I join an OSG Virtual Organization (VO)?</dt>
	<dd>Different VOs may have different membership methods. You will first need to determine which VO is most appropriate for you to join, then see the [[VO.WebHome][VO Web]] for links to that VO's membership procedures.  [[HowToJoinVo][Read more...]]</dd>

</dl>
---++ Getting Support

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>What OSG mailing lists should I subscribe to?</dt>
	<dd>The OSG maintains several different [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Using_the_OSG/Consortium_Mailing_Lists][mailing lists]] that distribute announcements, provide discussion forums, activity coordination forums, and so on.    </dd>
	
	<dt>Is there a glossary of grid computing terms?</dt>
	<dd>The OSG communications team maintains a [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/OSG_Glossary][glossary of OSG terms]].</dd>
	
	<dt>How do I get support for problems I encounter while using OSG resources?</dt>
	<dd>Users typically get support through contacting your [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Support_Centers][VO support center]]. Site administrators often use the _osg-general_ and _osg-int_ mailing lists.   [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Support][Read more...]] </dd>

	<dt>How can I use <nop>MonALISA to monitor my OSG work?</dt>
	<dd>MonALISA is an optional sevice.  Monitoring [[Integration/ITB_0_7/SiteMonitoringServices][Site Monitoring Services]] ... %RED%AH got to here%ENDCOLOR%



VORS is recommended.  We encourage you to explore the other monitoring options available to you, depending on whether you are monitoring user jobs, a remote site you want to run jobs on, or your local site's resources.  [[ReleaseDocumentation/MonALISA][More on MonALISA...]] <!-- Target page is a bit cumbersome. Make separate page and link to this one in release doc? -->   </dd>
	
	<dt>What is VORS?</dt>
	<dd>"The Virtual Organization Resource Selector provides a top-level view of computational or storage resources available across multiple grids and regions of the world filtered by each resource's support for a particular Virtual Organization." [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/documentation/index.html][Read more...]] </dd>
</dl>

---++ Running Jobs
<dl class="faq">
	
	<dt>How do I run a job on an OSG resource?</dt>
	<dd>This is often specific to your particular VO's policies and procedures. See your VO's support staff for more. We have [[Documentation.JobHowToRun][general information on running jobs using the base software stack]]. At minimum, you will need a [[Documentation/CertificateWhatIs][current grid certificate]] from an authorized Certificate Authority.       <!-- I think this is obsolete; answer is VO-specific; for the "OSG" VO, point to the [[GridUsersGuide]];  Do we need to start at [[JoinToUseResources]] (user guide points to it; maybe reconcile with getting started page)   -->    </dd>

	<dt>What is a Condor submission script?</dt>
	<dd>   [[CondorScriptSamples][Samples of Condor scripts...]]      <!-- Needs review  -->  </dd>

	<dt>What is the GLUE schema used in OSG?</dt>
	<dd>The GLUE Schema is an abstract model for Grid resources that can be used in Grid Information Services. [[http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/projects/glue-wg][Read more...]]     <!--  Right link?   -->  </dd>
	
	<dt>What is the Generic Information Provider (GIP)? </dt>
	<dd>[[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders#Introduction][Read more...]]      <!--  (it points to an OSG-GIP page in the intro, and the link is bad)   --> </dd>
	
	<dt>How do I troubleshoot a job that is not running properly?
	<dd>OSG has created a [[Troubleshooting.WebHome][Troubleshooting activity]] that has developed a model for [[TroubleshootJobHowTo][troubleshooting jobs]].     <!--  needs review  --> </dd>

 </dl>

---++ Installing the OSG Client

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>How do I install the OSG client on my desktop computer?</dt>
	<dd>The OSG client software is installed via the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) through Pacman, a packaging system. Installing the OSG client requires: <ul><li>This process assumes that you have already [[Documentation/CertificateGet][obtained a grid certificate]] from an OSG-recognized Certificate Authority and joined an OSG Virtual Organization. If you have not, you will not be able to complete this process.</li><li>Meet the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/requirements.html][VDT System Requirements]]. The OSG Client will only install on certain Linuxes. It will not install on BSD variants (including Mac OS) or other *nixes.</li></ul> [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][Read more...]] </dd>
	
	<dt>How do I install and use the Pacman software packaging tool?</dt>
	<dd>[[http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/][Pacman]] is a package management tool that allows you to define, install, and configure software. Pacman is installed via a downloaded tarball. [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInfo][Read more on Pacman...]]</dd>

</dl>


---++ Resource manager topics

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>How is the OSG software packaged?</dt>
	<dd>%INCLUDE{"Documentation.PackageDistributeOSG"}%</dd>

	<dt>What is Pacman and why are we using it?</dt>
	<dd>Pacman is a package management tool that allows you to define, install, and configure software. A lengthy discussion about how to package the OSG software took place awhile back and pacman was seen to be superior at that time for the particular problems the OSG teams were attempting to solve. See the mailing lists' archives for a fuller accounting of it.</dd>
</dl>

---++ Installation and Configuration of OSG Sites

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>What should I name my OSG resource?</dt>
	<dd>%INCLUDE{ "ReleaseDocumentation.OSGResourceName" section="definition" }%   [[ReleaseDocumentation.OSGResourceName][Read more...]]  <!-- Documentation/Trash.DocumentationCEResourceNaming needs mentions gridcat -->  </dd>
	
	<dt>How do I install an OSG compute element?</dt>
	<dd>The OSG Computer Element (CE) software has several prerequisites for the platform and hardware. You will also need to understand the systems that you will be using for your CE and worker nodes, along with the network and firewall configuration for your site.  [[ReleaseDocumentation.CEInstallGuide][Complete, detailed instructions for completing an OSG CE installation are available.]] </dd>
	
	<dt>What should I install on my site's worker nodes?</dt>
	<dd>TBD  <!--  needs review  and this was in the trash Documentation/Trash.DocumentationCEAdminWorkerNodePackages -->  </dd>
	
	<dt>Do I need to shut down and uninstall my Compute Element (CE) installations before I upgrade them?</dt>
	<dd>In VDT 1.6.1 and later, all services (=/etc/init.d=, =/etc/xinetd.d=, =cron=) should be turned on/off using the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control= script. [[ReleaseDocumentation/OSGShutdownGuide][Read more...]] (Also, see the man page: =man vdt-control=.)     <!--  athd (what about client? It's not in ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide)  -->  </dd>

	<dt>What are the requirements for storage on my OSG compute element?</dt>
	<dd>Describing the requirements for setting up the storage [[Documentation/CEAdminStorageRequirements][Read more...]]  <!--  needs review   --> </dd>
	
	<dt>How should I configure storage on my OSG compute element?</dt>
	<dd>[[ReleaseDocumentation/LocalStorageConfiguration][Read more...]] <!--  atho   --> </dd>
	
	<dt>What are the local storage paths on my compute element and how are they used?</dt>
	<dd>[TBD] Read more on [[Documentation/CEAdminLocalStoragePaths][getting the definitions of the CE local storage environment variables]].       <!--  athi needs review   --> </dd>
	
	<dt>How do I set up a storage element (SE) using SRM/DRM?</dt>
	<dd>Follow the instructions for your storage element software. Currently, the suggested SE platform is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras/InstallingDcacheForOSG.html][VDT dCache]]. Read more on [ReleaseDocumentation/SrmDrm][SRM and DRM in OSG]].      <!-- athk  --> </dd>

	<dd>%INCLUDE{ "Documentation.SwReleaseFutureCompatibility" }%    <!-- atii needs review  --> </dd>
	
	<dt>How do I troubleshoot the edg-mkgridmap script?</dt>
	<dd>[[Documentation/CEAdminTroubleshootEdgMkgridmap][Error code 64]] is described on this site. For other errors or additional help, see the support contacts or the OSG mailing lists.     <!--  athf needs review, needs info for more than just error 64   -->  </dd>

	<dt>How do I activate and deactivate my Resource on the OSG GridCat?</dt>
	<dd>GridCat has been deprecated. See the information on VORS and Gratia.      <!-- ? obsolete - replace with what?    atjs  --> </dd>
	
	<dt>How do I authorize users on a compute element?</dt>
	<dd>OSG supports three of the available GUMS authorization scenarios?: Grid3/Local, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. All three use the Virtual Organization Membership Service (VOMS). [[ReleaseDocumentation/OsgCEAuthorization][Read more...]]    <!--  atia   -->  </dd>

</dl>


---++ Security and Certificates

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>What is a grid certificate?</dt>
	<dd>Grid certificates are ways to prove that you are who you claim to be when you attempt to use an OSG resource. These certificates are issued by a trusted source (e.g., the US Dept. of Energy) and require a password from you. In this way, they are similar to using ID cards such as your driver's license or passport. You must have a currently valid certificate that was issued from an approved Certificate Authority to use OSG resources. [[Documentation/CertificateWhatIs][Read more...]] </dd>

	<dt>How do I get or renew a grid certificate for users of the OSG?</dt>
	<dd>There is [[Documentation/CertificateGet][general information on how to get a certificate for the OSG]] and [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-ra/PersonalRequest.php][information specific to obtaining a US Dept. of Energy certificate]].  Contact your Virtual Organization for what certificate authority is used within your group. <!-- Anybody know if DOEGrids procedure has changed in last 8 mos? Else, AH to review.  Oh, do we want to point to [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-ra/PersonalRequest.php]] instead?  --> </dd>
	
	<dt>What are OSG users' responsibilities in keeping OSG resources secure?</dt>
	<dd>As an OSG user, you are expected to:
		<ul><li>Protect your grid identity token</li>
		<li>Abide by the policies and procedures of your Virtual Organization (VO)</li>
		<li>Report any known or suspected security breach </li></ul>
	[[Documentation/SecurityUserResponsibilities][Read more...]]     <!--  needs review by security team member  --> </dd>

	<dt>What should I do if a security incident occurs?</dt>
	<dd>First, don't panic! If you believe a security incident has occurred with an OSG resource, telephone the [[Documentation.GocWhatIs][Grid Operations Center (GOC)]] immediately.   <!--   I think we should deprecate this twiki page and add sec incident info to Getting_Started/Support.  -->  </dd>

---++ Additional questions
---+++ From general trawling
<dl class="faq">
	<dt>Where can I get funding to convert my applications to parallelism needed on the OSG?</dt>
	<dd>The OSG can provide assistance with installation and administration of OSG sites, installation and use of client software to run grid jobs on the OSG, and even assistance in troubleshooting enabling your application for the grid. But the OSG does not provide funding for this process.</dd>



	<dt>Who funds the OSG?</dt>
	<dd>The OSG is supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science. Funding for work done at sites and by partners comes from a variety of sources specific to that site or organization. </dd>

	<dt>Does OSG control the OSG resources?</dt>
	<dd> </dd>
	
	<dt>Where can I get training on how to use the grid?</dt>
	<dd>The [[Education.WebHome][Education, Training and Outreach activity]] performs grid schools and workshops in a variety of locations across the world. Your group can sponsor a grid school at your facility. The grid school tutorial labs are available online and can be gone through by individuals on their own, requiring only access to an OSG compute element.</dd>
	
	<dt>How do I port my existing application to work on the OSG resources?</dt>
	<dd></dd>
	
	<dt>Who is not a good candidate to use the OSG?</dt>
	<dd>
		<ul><li>Interactive applications, requiring input from the user while they run, won't work well on the OSG because of the limits on interacting with your application. However, many of these applications can be rewritten in such a way as to not require the interaction, or to decrease it to levels where the grid's resources can provide substantial runtime improvements.</li>
		<li>Applications that require a large ammount of inter-process communication between jobs (for example, needing MPI) are currently poor candidates for enabling on OSG because very few sites are MPI-enabled.</li>
		<li>Applications that have strict schedules and depend on external data sources.</li>
		<li>Needing bandwidth between sites that doesn't exist.</li>
		<li>Firm and nonstandard system dependencies.</li>
		<li>Jobs that will create a lot of inter-process communication on the grid servers, including complex job flows. </li>
		<li>Needing network ports or protocols that are not disallowed at the grid site. For the most part, having large pulls on external data, rather than pre-staging the data at the site you will use, can be a bad idea.</li>

---+++ From the Grid Schools

<dl class="faq">
	<dt>Can someone reset the password on my certificate key?</dt>
	<dd>No. You are the only person who knows the password to your keys.</dd>

	<dt>Can I really run my job on any OSG resource without talking to the site first?</dt>
	<dd>Almost. You can run your job on any OSG site that allows users from your Virtual Organization. Many sites allow users from all OSG VOs.</dd>

	<dt>What happens if I run a "bazillion squillion" jobs on one site?</dt>
	<dd>You'll only do it once. It makes the site administrators very angry, and you wouldn't like them when their angry. It's the same as if you are a normal user at that site and do too much. It might mean that the admin's retribution is visited upon your entire VO  rather than you specifically.</dd>

	<dt>What is the difference between gram2 and gram4 (i.e., between globus-job-run and globusrun-ws)?</dt>
	<dd>According to [[http://www.globus.org/][Globus]], <blockquote>"In WS GRAM, the globusrun-ws command implements the functionality of globusrun using the XML Job Description language in place of the RSL format job description of pre-WS GRAM. It also allows specifying parts of the Job Description with simple command line arguments (for executable and arguments), similar to what one would do with globus-job-run. Like globusrun, the globusrun-ws program supports both the interactive and batch submission of GRAM jobs." </blockquote> [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/execution/wsgram/WS_GRAM_Migrating_Guide.html][Read more...]]  </dd>
