   $ LCG (Worldwide LHC Computing Grid): Computing Grid project at CERN. The goal of the LCG project is to meet the LHC experiments' unprecedented computing needs by deploying a worldwide computational grid service, integrating the capacity of scientific computing centers spread across Europe, America and Asia into a virtual computing organisation. See http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/.

   $ LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, a protocol used to locate resources in a network.

   $ Lifetime (of a pin): For storage, the period of time for which a file is guaranteed to remain available (remain "pinned") in a given storage area for a client. A pin lifetime is requested by a client and granted/denied by SRM at the time the file is moved in for that client. A separate, independent pin lifetime is set (or denied) for any other client who requests it once the file is already there. Client may release pin before lifetime expires. Action taken on file after last pin lifetime expires (or pin is released) is dependent on the SRM configuration.

   $ Lifetime (of a space): For storage, the period of time for which a (temporary, volatile or durable) storage area is guaranteed to remain available. Particular space may be requested by a client, in which case space lifetime may be negotiated. Or space and space lifetime may be assigned by default by the SRM. Any pin lifetime set for a file in the space may not exceed the remaining space lifetime.

   $ Logical File Name: (LFN) A globally unique name for a file on the grid, that is location and machine independent; it may point to any PFN for the given file. LFNs are governed by the replica catalog and use the RLS.

   $ Logistical Networking: Logistical Networking technology builds on a highly generic storage service that uses the Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP), which it deploys on storage servers called depots (see SPD or SRM Parallel Depot).

   $ L-Bone<a name="DefsLbone"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsLogisticalBackbone][Logistical Backbone]].
   $ layer<a name="DefsLayer"></a>: Pnfs stores metadata about each file in &#8220;layers&#8221;, each layer containing a specific type of metadata. Each stored data file has its own set of these layers. Currently, only layers 1 and 4 are used. 
   $ LDR<a name="DefsLdr"></a>: Lightweight Data Replicator. 
   $ library<a name="DefsLibrary"></a>: (Enstore) The collection of storage media and devices that includes physical data storage media, robotic devices and drives. An Enstore library is typically called a _robot_. 
   $ library manager (LM)<a name="DefsLibraryManager"></a>: A server that controls a virtual library. LMs receive requests for file copies from users via encp and they distribute the requests to the Movers. 
   $ light path<a name="DefsLightPath"></a>: direct connection between the source of data and the recipient over an optical network.
   $ LM<a name="DefsLm"></a>: _See_ library manager.
   $ local replica catalog (LRC)<a name="DefsLocalReplicaCatalog"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsReplicaCatalog][replica catalog]].

   $ !LoDN<a name="DefsLodn"></a>: _See also:_ [[http://promise.sinrg.cs.utk.edu/lodn/][Logistical Distribution Network site]].
   $ log server (LS)<a name="DefsLogServer"></a>: Receives messages from other processes and logs them into formatted log files that are available online. 
   $ logical file name (LFN): a unique file name that is location and machine independent to support replication of files. LFNs are mapped to particular PFNs by [[#DefsReplicaCatlog][replica catalogs]] or [[#DefsReplicationLocationService][replication location service]].
   $ logical networking (LN)<a name="DefsLogicalNetworking"></a>: Builds on a highly generic storage service that uses the [[#DefsInternetBackplaneProtocol][Internet Backplane Protocol (IBP)]] which it deploys on storages services called _depots_.
