---++ About This Document
The OSG Certificate Authority Distribution contains configuration information for Certificate Authorities (CAs) in use in OSG.  This document describes the contents and the configuration process for this distribution.

---+++ News

Effective 25 June 2010 the old FNAL_KCA has been removed, in OSG CA package version 1.15.
   * FNAL KCA (e1fce4e9)

Beginning in  May , 2010 OSG has started to provide a CA distribution for the integration test bed (ITB) separate
from the production OSG distribution described below. Information about the ITB release is provided at http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/.<br/>
%WARNING% Production services on OSG should *NOT* install (or reference via yum or apt) the ITB
version of the CA distribution since it may, at times, contain an untrustworthy CA certificate for testing purposes!%ENDCOLOR%

Effective March 10, 2009, the OSG Security Team has removed the following unused non-IGTF CAs from the
OSG CA distribution:

   * PSC Kerberos CA (290a3b29)
   * PSC Root CA (9b88e95b)
   * PSC Hosts CA (acc06fda)
   * SDSC (3deda549)
   * NPACI (b89793e4)
   * TACC (9a1da9f9)
   * old NCSA CA (4a6cd8b1)

If you are aware of any use of these CAs in OSG, so that they should
continue to be included in the OSG CA distribution, please notify
security@opensciencegrid.org immediately.

---+++ CA Caches
There are now three locations from which CA certificates can be downloaded (CA-Certificates-Updater):
   * OSG: This location is the *primary* distribution maintained by the OSG security team and contains *OSG recommended* CAs. This typically includes IGTF accredited CAs plus few unaccredited CAs added at the request of one or more OSG VOs.
   * VDT: This location contains only the IGTF accredited CAs and maintained by the VDT team. OSG Security team does not review the contents of this cache.  
   * ITB: This location is maintained by the OSG security team and is intended for ITB testing only and *should not* be used for production. 

The vdt-update-certs package now has a configuration file you must edit to specify which location is used to
download the set of available CA certificates.

In addition, the vdt-update-certs package can be configured to include or exclude individual CAs
from the trusted CA installation directory.
See http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/man/vdt-update-certs.html for additional information on these
capabilities of vdt-update-certs.

Mine's comment: why do we include these technical details here. Is this page only for describing contents of CA cache or for describing how to install ca caches. i think it is the former. delete configuration, and check your version sections. Move the reference section up. that is the important part. links in the references section should also be linked from the main installing a ce web page. user can know if so wishes what is included in each cache. 


Mine's comment: this page has zero backlinks. Who is reading or linking this page. This is ORPHANED. There is a place needed for any users to get a link to see the contents of the ca caches. it is missing.  

---++ Configuration

To configure the OSG CA distribution use the <tt>--url osg</tt> option with <tt>vdt-ca-manage</tt> as described at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Install_a_Certificate_Authority][Configuring the CA Handling]]

---++ Check your version
To check the version installed on your service/site do
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT% head -20 $X509_CADIR/CHANGES
</pre>
and the top of the CHANGES file will show which version you have installed.
If it is not the latest one on the [[http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/][distribution site]] then you probably do not have automatic updates
running so you should read the instructions above about running vdt-update-certs.
