---+ OSG Certificate Authority Distribution

%TOC%

The OSG Certificate Authority Distribution contains configuration information for Certificate Authorities (CAs) in use in OSG for vdt-update-certs.

---++ Background
Some of the procedures for how CA certificates are distributed by OSG and VDT are changing in Sept. 2008 in order to accomplish
a couple goals. One is that the OSG security team will directly maintain the set of certificates that get distributed
and the second *more important* goal is that site/resource administrators will need to be more aware of the choices they make
in terms of what CAs are trusted for authenticating access to their resources.
It used to be that a set of CA certificates was installed nearly automatically when you installed any software from VDT or OSG that
requires having a set of trusted CAs available.  This obscures the fact (and policy) that the resource administrators are
responsible for the CAs which are trusted on that resource.  

---+++ Know your responsibilities
There are now two locations from which CA certificates can be downloaded by the vdt-update-certs package (CA-Certificates-Updater);
one with only the IGTF accredited CAs maintained by the VDT team and the other *primary* distribution of *OSG recommended*
CA certificates maintained by the OSG security team, and this is shown in the configuration description below.
The vdt-update-certs package now has a configuration file you must edit to specify which location is used to
download the set of available CA certificates.  In addition, the vdt-update-certs package was updated recently
to make it more convenient for administrators to pick and choose individual CAs to include or exclude from their
trusted CA installation directory. See http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/man/vdt-update-certs.html for additional information on these
capabilities of vdt-update-certs.

---++ Configuration

To configure vdt-update-certs to use the OSG CA Distribution, set the =cacerts_url= value in =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf= as follows:

<verbatim>
cacerts_url=http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version
</verbatim>
