---+!! Site Responsibilities for Security
%TOC%

This describes the expectations and actions that a site administrator handles regarding security issues
as a participant in OSG.

---++ Background
It is expected that the administrative and security contacts for a resource registered with OSG (in OIM)
are capable of dealing with the normal system administration and security practices of running
a cluster of machines for scientific computing.  The security materials provided on the OSG twiki
occasionally mention examples of how basic computer security features could be handled
but that is not a replacement for for formal in-depth training on unix system administration.
We have collected some examples in a Security.BestPractices page (which you are welcome to contribute to).

---++ Site Registration
This is normally a one time occurrence and is handled by filling out the registration form
at the [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Grid Operations Center]] and attending one of the
[[Operations.ProductionMeetingMinutes][weekly Operations meetings]] to introduce yourself and your site.

It is important to provide accurate and reliable contact information with the registration.
At large sites with active involvement with OSG the operations and security contacts for a site
are likely different people (or groups). At some small sites it is likely that the operations contact
and the security contact are the same person.  The important aspect of the security contact
is to be someone who will read and understand the security notices from OSG.
If the professional computer & network security staff at your site need to be reminded of
what OSG is every time you ask them something then the security contact for OSG should be
the person responsible for the general system administration of the grid resource.

 
---++ Maintenance of Contact Info in OIM
You can update your contact information in the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Information Management (OIM)]] system
by clicking the Profile link.
You need a [[Documentation.CertificateGet][personal X.509 certificate]] in your web browser in order to register with OIM and to
access it to update your information.  OSG will do a periodic assessment of the contact information to encourage it's
being accurate but it is expected that people will keep their own information current.

---++ Read Security Notifications from OSG
OSG sends out security notifications to all security contacts when important events occur,
like a vulnerability notice requiring a software update.  If you receive a notice you are expected to read it
and read the detailed information linked to a ticket at the GOC.
The notice looks similar to:
<verbatim>

-------- Original Message --------
Subject: OSG-SEC-NOTIFY-2009-06-20
Date: Sat, 20 Jun 2009 00:22:49 +0000 (UTC)
From: goc@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
To: goc@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG


A new security notification has been posted.

You are receiving this message because you are listed as a security contact for an OSG resource 
or VO or support center. Assuming you are registered on OIM, and are authorized to view 
security tickets, please open the following URL for further information:
https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=XXXXX

Please contact security@opensciencegrid.org if you have any questions or concerns.

This message is digitally signed. We encourage you to verify the digital signatures on 
OSG security announcements according to:
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecureEmail

Sincerely,
OSG Security Team
</verbatim>
Any subsequent correspondence you have about a particular notice should include the
OSG-SEC-NOTIFY tag in the subject line <br/>(<tt>OSG-SEC-NOTIFY-2009-06-20</tt> in the example above).

As indicated, the notice should be digitally signed either as S/MIME with an X.509 certificate,
or using [[Security.SecureEmail][PGP with the key]] for security@opensciencegrid.org.

You will need your personal certificate that is registered with OIM in your browser in order to read the details of the
notice in the ticket.

---++ Apply security updates of VDT/OSG software
There are frequent updates to the grid software for security and functional improvements,
just like any other software.  A site is expected to apply the security updates in a timely manner.
How quickly the update should be applied is a judgment call for the site but anything
longer than a few days delay should have a very good reason.
One example notice of an update message is:
<verbatim>

-------- Original Message --------
Subject: Security updates: VDT 1.10.1x and 2.0.0p2
Date: Mon, 08 Jun 2009 20:51:23 +0000 (UTC)
From: goc@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
To: goc@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG

The VDT team announces the immediate availability of VDT 1.10.1x and 2.0.0p2, which contain an 
important security update to Glexec.  You can read about the VDT updates and the security advisory 
on these pages:

http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/release-x.html
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p2.html
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/advisories/glexec-0.5.36.html

We recommend updating installations of VDT 1.10.1 and 2.0.0 right away.

The notice above is for a security update to the Glexec software and should be considered urgent
for sites running Glexec. If a site is not running Glexec then it is not urgent.

Another example notice is shown below, which is a more general software update
but includes a security update for Java.  Most sites use Java in one form or another
and so it should be considered important for all sites but since it was not identified
specifically as a Security Update it is not critical.
