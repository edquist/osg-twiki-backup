---+!! Condor-G to Glidein Workflow Management System porting guide
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC%

---++ About This Document
This document is meant for VO's transitioning from Condor-G to !GlideinWMS.  It assumes some knowledge of Condor, a working install of !GlideinWMS, as well as access to Condor-G submission files.

This document emphasizes changes the user may experience when moving from Condor-G to !GlideinWMS.  But, some commands have not changed such as submitting jobs is still with =condor_submit &lt;submitfile>=.   !GlideinWMS uses vanilla universe for job execution; anything that can be done in vanilla universe on a local cluster (with file transfer) will work in !GlideinWMS.

---++Submission File
The differences between the submission file for Condor-G and !GlideinWMS are minimal.

   * Since Condor is no longer submitting directly to the grid, the universe for the job will need to change from grid, to vanilla.
   <pre class="file">
   universe=grid</pre>
   to
    <pre class="file">
   universe=vanilla</pre>

   * It is useful to have an error detection/correction statement in the submission file such as:
   <pre class="file">
   OnExitHold = (ExitStatus =!= 0)
   OnExitRemove = (ExitStatus == 0)
   PeriodicRelease = ((CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > 60) && (HoldReasonCode =!= 1) && (NumJobStarts <= N) </pre>
   This statement will hold the job if it exits with a non-zero status.  It will remove the job only if it exited successfully (exit status 0).  And it will release the job if it wasn't held with 'condor_hold' after 60 seconds and the job hasn't started more than N times.
%NOTE% It is not necessary to use error detection when using dagman.  Dagman has it's own retry [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.4/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html#SECTION003106100000000000000][mechanism]].


---+++ File Transfer
   * Need to specify should_transfer_files:
     <pre class="file">
     should_transfer_files = YES</pre>

   * It is still necessary to specify transfer_input_files, but do not need to specify transfer_output_files.  !GlideinWMS will transfer every file that is created back to the submission host.  This often leads to many temporary files being transferred back when a job completes.  It is important to delete temporary files as a part of your job.


---+++ User Proxy
Some sites on the OSG require a user proxy to accompany a !GlideinWMS job.  After running =voms-proxy-init= on your submission host, the proxy will be located in /tmp.  =voms-proxy-init= will output the full pathname of the proxy file.  You can also figure out the name, since the name will be =x509up_u&lt;userid>=, and userid can be obtained with the command:
<pre class="screen">
$ id -u
501</pre>

The full path to the proxy must be explicitly specified on in the Condor submit file:

<pre class="file">
...
X509UserProxy = /tmp/x509up_u501
...
queue </pre>

---+++ Demotion after failed jobs
In OSGMM, a typical submission file included the lines:
<pre class="file">
match_list_length = 4
Rank              = (TARGET.Rank) - &#92;
                    ((TARGET.Name =?= LastMatchName0) * 1000) - &#92;
                    ((TARGET.Name =?= LastMatchName1) * 1000) - &#92;
                    ((TARGET.Name =?= LastMatchName2) * 1000) - &#92;
                    ((TARGET.Name =?= LastMatchName3) * 1000)
</pre>

For the OSG MM, this statement discourages the scheduler to resubmit a failed job to the same cluster (referred to as TARGET.Name). For !GlideinWMS, TARGET.Name refers to a specific worker node rather than an entire site; therefore, this statement discourages the scheduler to resubmit the job to the same worker node. Because !GlideinWMS runs a pilot job before running a user job, the environment is considered less error-prone than with OSG MM. Therefore this statement is not very useful and it is recommended that it is removed.

---+++ Idle job timeout
It is common in OSGMM to have a timeout statement similiar to:
<pre class="file">
# make sure the job is being retried and rematched
periodic_release = (NumGlobusSubmits &lt; 5)
globusresubmit = (NumSystemHolds >= NumJobMatches)
# rematch = True
globus_rematch = True

# only allow for the job to be queued at a site for a while, then try to move it.
#  GlobusStatus==16 is suspended
#  JobStatus==1 is pending
#  JobStatus==2 is running
periodic_hold = ( (GlobusStatus==16) || &#92;
                  ((JobStatus==1) && ((CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > (1*60*60))) || &#92;
                  ((JobStatus==2) && ((CurrentTime - EnteredCurrentStatus) > (5*60*60))) )

</pre>
OSGMM has the periodic hold in order to redistribute jobs if a site has become too busy and has not started the job yet.  !GlideinWMS does not need this redistribution because when a slot opens, the job moves from the local queue directly to running, without being submitted to the remote site's queue.

transfer_input_files = $(inputTab)
remote_output_files = srm://red-srm1.unl.edu:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/mnt/hadoop/user/powers/Rosetta/$(storeNumber)/Step1/rosetta.step1.tar.gz

executable = init.sh
Args = $(inputTab) $(remote_output_files)

input=input.file.$(Process)
output=condor_out/output.$(Cluster).$(Process)
error=condor_out/error.$(Cluster).$(Process)
log=results.log

X509UserProxy = /tmp/x509up_u501

queue 1
</pre>

   * The =inputTab= and =storeNumber= are the inputs into the file.  =storeNumber= is a unique identifier used for storing on the srm server.
   * Notice the =should_transfer_files= and =when_to_tranfser_output= are both specified.  These are specified because there is no shared file system in !GlideinWMS
   * =transfer_input_files= is here to designate what files to transfer with the job.  
   * =remote_output_files= is where to store the output file after the job completes.  The job (init.sh) has the transfer written into it.
   * =output=, =error=, and =log= are standard in any Condor job description.

---++DAGMan Pitfalls

If you are using DAGMan as your workflow manager, this section notes differences in how DAGMan works with Condor-G vs. !GlideinWMS.

When A Condor-G job completes, the exit status of the job is always 0 regardless of the actual exit status at the remote site.  Since Condor interprets a 0 exit status as success, DAGMan will always interpret the job as succeeding in Condor-G.  A common approach to solve this is to have each job have a post script to check for successful completion.

In !GlideinWMS, the correct exit status will be transferred back with the job.  In this case, it is easier to use DAGMan's automatic exit status checking for error detection.  If you only want error detection, then you do not need to add anything to the DAG.  If you want DAGMan to retry the job if it fails, add:
<pre class="file">
RETRY node_name 5</pre>
This will retry the job after a failure 5 times.

%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show example !DAGMan Submission file"
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="file">
JOB step1 condor.step1.submit
JOB step3 condor.step3.submit
SCRIPT PRE step1 pre.sh step1
JOB step2-0 condor.step2.submit
PARENT step1 CHILD step2-0
PARENT step2-0 CHILD step3
RETRY step2-0 1000
JOB step2-1 condor.step2.submit

RETRY step2-1 1000
....
JOB step2-999 condor.step2.submit
PARENT step1 CHILD step2-999
PARENT step2-999 CHILD step3
RETRY step2-999 1000

Retry step1 5
Retry step3 5
</pre>

In this example, the DAG has a single setup node (step1), a 1000 node wide middle (step2), and a single finishing node (step3).

---++Monitoring Jobs

It is more difficult in !GlideinWMS to monitor exactly where your jobs are going.  !GlideinWMS's VOFrontend provides some monitoring regarding the glidein (pilot) jobs AND user jobs running at a site. How to obtain information about both types of jobs is explained below.  

This command will output the number of glideins pilot jobs at each site:
<pre class="screen">
condor_status -format '%s\n' 'GLIDEIN_Site' -const 'IS_MONITOR_VM =!= TRUE' | sort | uniq -c</pre>
This command will output the number of glideins at each site.
%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show example output"
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%

<pre class="screen">
[dweitzel@glidein ~]$ condor_status -format '%s\n' 'GLIDEIN_Site' -const 'IS_MONITOR_VM =!= TRUE' | sort | uniq -c
      3 BNL
    210 Nebraska
    764 Omaha
     57 UConn
      1 UCSD
     16 UNESP
      5 Wisconsin
</pre>

%ENDTWISTY%

We've also found adding the following to your local condor_config is helpful.  The first line defines the JOBGLIDEIN_Site attribute to be equal to the glidein-site of the batch slot.  The second line instructs condor to insert the JOBGLIDEIN_Site attribute into every job when it is submitted.
<pre class="file">
JOBGLIDEIN_Site="$$([TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site])"
SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) JOBGLIDEIN_Site
</pre>
This means that every running job will have an entry in their !ClassAd noting where it is running.

For example, you can query your job locations using the following:
%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show example output"
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="screen">
[bbockelm@glidein ~]$ condor_q -run -format '%s\n' MATCH_EXP_JOBGLIDEIN_Site | sort | uniq -c
    403 Omaha
      5 UConn
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%


---++ Node Verification in !GlideinWMS
Verification of a worker node can be done before the glidein starts jobs.  A verification script can be specified inside the !VOFrontend's configuration file, =frontend.xml=.

<pre class="file">
...
&lt;files&gt;
   &lt;file absfname="/home/frontend/glidein_scripts/startd.sh" after_entry="True" const="True" executable="True" untar="False" wrapper="False"&gt;
      &lt;untar_options cond_attr="TRUE"/&gt;
   &lt;/file&gt;
&lt;/files&gt;
...
</pre>
More documentation on custom scripts can be found on the  [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.v2/manual/factory/custom_scripts.html][!GlideinWMS pages]].
