---+ Open Science Grid: A User Introduction

This page is an introduction to the <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>cience <b>G</b>rid (*OSG*) from a user point-of-view.  See also [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][Information on joining and using OSG]] and [[Documentation/Release3.NavUserMain][User Documentation]].

The <b>O</b>pen <b>S</b>cience <b>G</b>rid (*OSG*) provides access to a *international Grid of computing and storage resources*.  We provide common service and support for resource providers and scientific institutions using it. The OSG does not own resources but provides software and services to users and resource providers alike to enable the opportunistic usage and sharing of resources. The OSG is jointly funded by the [[http://www.energy.gov/][Department of Energy]] and the [[http://www.nsf.gov/][National Science Foundation]].

High-throughput computing needs of our scientific users are being met by a [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?all_sites=on&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on#39.232253,-96.591797|4|Terrain large number of computing resources]] that can be accessed directly through *Globus* services or more conveniently through grid technologies build on top of them. Storage resources provide _easy_ access to terabytes of storage space through the common *SRM* protocol. The resources contributing to the OSG are primarily Linux clusters with Ethernet interconnects. 

---+ Succeeding on the OSG

The OSG is primarily used as a _high-throughput grid_ where scientific problems are solved by breaking them down into a very large number of individual jobs that can run independently. The _%GREEN%most successful opportunistic applications%ENDCOLOR%_ run on the OSG share the following characteristics:

   * The application is a Linux application for the x86 or x86_64 architecture.
   * The application is single- or multi-threaded but does not require message passing.
   * The application has a small runtime between 1 and 24 hours.
   * The application can handle being unexpectedly killed, and restarted.
   * The application is build from software that does not require to contact licensing servers.
   * The scientific problem can be described as a workflow consisting of jobs of such kind.
   * The scientific problem requires to run a very large number of small jobs rather than a few large jobs.

Other applications may succeed, but users may have difficult barriers to surmount. Some characteristics of _%RED%applications that do not run well%ENDCOLOR%_ opportunistically on the OSG are:

   * The application requires message passing and a low-latency local network.
   * The application requires a long runtime and cannot be checkpointed through signal _TERM_.
   * The application workflow cannot tolerate preemptions or individual jobs crashing at remote sites.
   * The application requires complex software and specific environments that cannot be easily met on resources.
   * The application requires write access to a code base pre-installed at sites and shared among the worker nodes.
   * The application requires administrator privileges for its operation.

Software Platform
The primary goal of the OSG software effort is to build, integrate, test, distribute, and support a set of common software for OSG administrators and users. OSG strives to provide a software stack that is easy to install and configure even though it depends on a large variety of complex software.
The key to making the OSG infrastructure work is a common package of software provided and supported by OSG called the OSG Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT).	The VDT includes Condor and Globus technologies with additional modules for security, storage and data management, workflow and other higher level services, as well as administrative software for testing, accounting and monitoring. The needs of the domain and computer scientists, together with the needs of the administrators of the resources, services and VOs, drive the contents and schedule of releases of the VDT. The OSG middleware allows the VOs to build an operational environment that is customized to their needs.
The OSG supports a heterogeneous set of operating systems and versions and provides software that publishes what is available on each resource. This allows the users and/or applications to dispatch work to those resources that are able to execute it. Also, through installation of the VDT, users and administrators operate in a well-defined environment and set of available services.
Common Services and Support
To enable the work of the VOs, the OSG provides direct staff support and operates a set of services. These functions are available to all VOs in OSG and provide a foundation for the specific environments built, operated, and supported by each VO; these include:

The Open Science Grid is proud to support a wide range of scientific research activities, among them:

   * Astrophysics: [[http://www.ligo.org LIGO]]
   * High Energy Physics: [[http://cms.web.cern.ch/cms/index.html CMS]] and [[http://atlas.ch/ ATLAS]]
   * Nanoscience: [[http://nanohub.org/ NANOHUB]]
   * Structural Biology: [[http://sbgrid.org/ SBGrid]]
   * Community VO (multiple sciences): [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Engagement/WebHome Engage]]
A complete list of VOs can be found in the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][OIM]] (OSG Information Management System).

Recent statistics [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/vo?set=Non-HEP%20VOs&vo=nanohub|glow|sdss|dteam|ligo|osg|engage|osgedu|tigre|nysgrid|cigi|compbiogrid|des|fmri|gpn|grase|gugrid|i2u2|mariachi|nwicg|sbgrid|star show]] that  [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/osg_sharing_sites_pie_perc][one third]] of the resources are used opportunistically by VOs that do not own resources and who benefit from the grid effort of the OSG. The OSG continues to grow and is currently supporting 30 [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?datasource=summary&all_vos=on&active_value=1][VOs]] at [[https://myosg.grid.iu.edu/map?map_attrs_shownr=on&all_sites=on&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on][80 sites]]. More than [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/byvo][1,000,000 cpu hours]] are turned into scientific results by their members every day.
