---+ Open Science Grid: A User Introduction

This page is an introduction to the OSG from a user point-of-view.  [[Documentation/UsingTheGrid][The top-level user navigation is located here]].

The Open Science Grid (*OSG*) provides a national cyber-infrastructure of *distributed computing and storage resources.*  It provides a common service, support, and infrastructure for resource providers and scientific institutions who need to utilize it.  The OSG is jointly funded by the [[http://www.energy.gov/][Department of Energy]] and the [[http://www.nsf.gov/][National Science Foundation]].

The resources composing the OSG are primarily commodity Linux (!RedHat) clusters with gigabit ethernet interconnects.  The storage resources are usually large, distributed storage systems; all have access through a common protocol and some can be accessed transparently through normal (POSIX) mounts on the cluster nodes.  Most computing and storage resources are owned by one or two organizations (such as a physics experiment) and many will provide access to outside users who do not own the resources.  The OSG does not own the resources, but by using our software and services, one can utilize the them.  This is called "opportunistic access".  Not all organizations have peak usage at the same time.  Therefore, there are usually many thousands of CPUs available for opportunistic use on the OSG, but the free CPUs may not always belong to the same site.  By using the OSG's software and services, you can get opportunistic access - in addition to better utilizing the distributed resources your organization may own.

---+ Succeeding on the OSG
The OSG is primarily used as a high-throughput grid.  The most successful opportunistic-use OSG applications share the following characteristics:
   * Linux applications for x86 architecture.
   * All jobs are single core.
   * A large number (thousand to hundred thousand) of jobs.
   * Workflows which achieve scale through many jobs.
   * Medium job lifetime - average between 1 and 8 hours per grid job.  All opportunistic jobs must last less than 24 hours and usually must be more than 30 minutes.
   * Software which does not require contacting licensing servers (can be run throughout the world).
Other applications can succeed, but users may have difficult barriers to surmount.  For example, there is active work in having multi-core jobs (but only ones that fit on one cluster node; less than 8 cores per job) run on the OSG .  Some characteristics of applications that do not run well opportunistically on the OSG are:
   * Jobs that run across many nodes or require a low-latency (sub-millisecond) local network.
   * Jobs which last for multiple days and cannot checkpoint.
   * Workflows that cannot tolerate preemptions or individual jobs crashing at remote sites.
   * Complex software require specific environments that cannot be reproduced without administrator privileges.

---+ Virtual Organizations
A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Organization_%28Grid_computing%29][virtual organization]] ("VO") is a set of groups or individuals defined by some common cyber-infrastructure need, for example a large experiment or a university campus).  By organizing individuals into a smaller number of groups, managing support and grid access becomes simpler.

The OSG support model assumes the end-user is supported by VOs.  Each VO is expected to register with the OSG and provide support for their individuals.  Larger VOs provide user interfaces in addition to user support.  Sites expect to work with and contact from VOs more than end users; this helps keep OSG support usable.

In cases where a researcher is not associated with a VO, they are welcome to join the OSG or Engage VOs.  The OSG VO is targeted to users who don't want help running, while the Engage VO provides strong support for individuals just starting with the grid or distributed computing.  Each VO has its own user support page and may provide more in-depth help; see the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][OIM database entry for your VO]].  Additionally, many VOs will provide dedicated resources for their users to run on.

%ICON{hand}% If you don't know what VO you belong to or should belong to, we suggest doing that before moving on; [[ReleaseDocumentation/TroubleTickets][you can file a trouble ticket for this]] or email goc at opensciencegrid.org for help.

Virtual Organizations (VOs) are at the heart of OSG principles and its model for operation. VOs are a collection of researchers who join together to accomplish their goals; typically they share the same mission, but that is not a requirement for establishing an OSG VO. A VO joins OSG to share their resources, computing and storage, with the other OSG VOs and to be able to access the resources provided by other OSG VOs as well as share data and resources with international computer grids (e.g. EGEE). The resources owned by a VO are often geographically distributed; a set of co-located resources are referred to as a site and thus a VO may own a number of sites. There are two key aspects of VOs: 1) the user community within a VO that submits jobs into the OSG; and 2) the set of computing and storage resources that are owned by a VO and connected to the OSG. In some cases, VOs do not bring resources to OSG and are only users of available resources on OSG.

A key principle in OSG is the autonomy of VOs that allows them to develop an operational model that best meets their science needs; this autonomy applies both to their user community and sites. OSG requires each VO to establish certain roles (i.e. VO manager, VO admin, VO Security Contact) and agree to a set of policies (e.g. Acceptable Use Policy) which allow operation of the OSG as a secure and efficient grid. VOs administer, manage, and support their own user community.	In addition, many VOs provide common software infrastructure designed to meet the specific needs of their users.	VOs as providers of resources also have great autonomy in building and
Introduction to OSG &#8208; 1	April 10, 2009
operating their sites. Sites use the OSG software stack to provide the “middleware layers” that make their sites ready for connection to the OSG. Sites set policies on how their resources will be used by their own users and other VOs; the only requirement is that sites support at least one other VO but the site controls the conditions under which that resource is available. OSG does not tightly restrict what hardware or operating system software a VO may supply or what software it may use to access OSG or provide resources on OSG: they are autonomous and are allowed to make such choices as long as they meet the basic requirements. This autonomy allows a VO to build its computing resource to meet its specific needs and makes it more likely that a VO will choose to join OSG because it doesn’t have to compromise its own needs to do so.

Software Platform
The primary goal of the OSG software effort is to build, integrate, test, distribute, and support a set of common software for OSG administrators and users. OSG strives to provide a software stack that is easy to install and configure even though it depends on a large variety of complex software.
The key to making the OSG infrastructure work is a common package of software provided and supported by OSG called the OSG Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT).	The VDT includes Condor and Globus technologies with additional modules for security, storage and data management, workflow and other higher level services, as well as administrative software for testing, accounting and monitoring. The needs of the domain and computer scientists, together with the needs of the administrators of the resources, services and VOs, drive the contents and schedule of releases of the VDT. The OSG middleware allows the VOs to build an operational environment that is customized to their needs.
The OSG supports a heterogeneous set of operating systems and versions and provides software that publishes what is available on each resource. This allows the users and/or applications to dispatch work to those resources that are able to execute it. Also, through installation of the VDT, users and administrators operate in a well-defined environment and set of available services.
Common Services and Support
To enable the work of the VOs, the OSG provides direct staff support and operates a set of services. These functions are available to all VOs in OSG and provide a foundation for the specific environments built, operated, and supported by each VO; these include:

---+ OSG Today (April 2009)
OSG provides an infrastructure that supports a broad scope of scientific research activities, including the major physics collaborations, nanoscience, biological sciences, applied mathematics, engineering, and computer science. Recent trends show that about 20-30% of the resources are used on an opportunistic basis by VOs that do not own them.
With about 80 sites and 30 VOs, the usage of OSG continues to grow; the usage varies depending on the needs of the stakeholders. During stable normal operations, OSG is providing over 600,000 CPU wall clock hours a day with peaks occasionally exceeding 800,000 CPU wall clock hours a day; approximately 100,000 to 200,000 opportunistic wall clock hours are available on a daily basis for resource sharing.
