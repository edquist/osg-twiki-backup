---++ Know who your institutional cyber security officer is
Most institutions have someone responsible for cyber security at the institution, usually
reporting to the CIO (Chief Information Officer) of the institution.  The person responsible
may have the title of Cyber Security Officer, or Computer Protection Program Manager,
or some other title. They are typically responsible for security of the central IT systems,
network security, and security awareness training for the users at that institution.
You should know who that person is. If you don't know who that is,
consider the following scenario.

%BLUE%Suppose someone has posted bootleg copies of licensed software
on one of your computers and it is available for download via a file sharing network
(bit torrent, gnutella, etc.) and it is discovered by the network security staff.
Who is going to come see you to investigate?
*Answer:* Someone from the cyber security officer's team.%ENDCOLOR%

You should introduce yourself to the cyber security officer and discuss any
institutional requirements for the operation of your grid site. Remember your local security team is always the primary party responsible for the security of your site. They may want to understand what your participation in OSG means. E.g. see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityRisksCE][Cyber Security Risks of Grid Resources]] If your local team has specific questions, let us know.
