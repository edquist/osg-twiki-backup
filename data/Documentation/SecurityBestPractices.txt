%ICON{wip}% Work in Progress

This page documents security practices recommended by the OSG Security Team.

---++ Incident Handling

Promptly report security incidents involving OSG resources according to the instructions at [[Security.IncidentDiscoveryReporting]].

---++ Monitoring

Actively monitor for ssh connection attempts from suspicious IP addresses and instances of suspicious ssh keys, files, and malware. Use logwatch. Can use Bro IDS.

---++ System Updates

Promptly apply security updates from software vendors, including operating system kernel updates.

---++ Firewalls

Use firewalls to restrict ssh access to OSG systems, so that ssh connections are allowed only from trusted hosts.

---++ SSH Keys

Protect SSH private keys with passphrases.

Don't share keys.

---++ Account Passwords

Use different passwords for different accounts. Always use good passwords.
