%ICON{wip}% Work in Progress

This page documents security practices recommended by the OSG Security Team.

---++ Incident Handling

Promptly report security incidents involving OSG resources according to 
[[Security.IncidentDiscoveryReporting][these instructions]].

---++ Monitoring

Monitor for suspicious activity such as 
   * connection attempts from suspicious IP addresses
   * instances of suspicious ssh keys, files, and malware 

Recommended monitoring tools:
   * [[http://www.logwatch.org/][Logwatch]]: A customizable log analysis system.
   * [[http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/][Samhain]]: A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).
   * [[http://www.bro-ids.org/][Bro]]: A network intrusion detection system (NIDS).
   * [[http://www.chkrootkit.org/][chkrootkit]]: A tool to locally check for signs of a rootkit.

---++ Logging

Log system activity and use logs to troubleshoot problems and investigate security incidents.

Resources:
   * [[Security.LogFiles4Services][Log Files for OSG Services]]

---++ System Updates

Promptly apply security updates from software vendors, including operating system kernel updates and VDT updates.

Resources:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.VdtUpdateGuide][VDT Update Guide]]
   * [[https://www.redhat.com/rhn/][Red Hat Network]]: Automates updates for Red Hat Linux systems.

---++ Firewalls

Use firewalls to restrict access to system services:
   * Allow ssh connections (port 22) only from trusted hosts. See [[Security.SshHostsAllow]] for documentation on how to restrict access using =/etc/hosts.allow= and =/etc/hosts.deny=.

Resources:
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/firewall.html][VDT and Firewalls]]
   * [[http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/][iptables]]: The command-line program for configuring the Linux firewall.

---++ SSH Keys

Protect SSH private keys with passphrases.

Don't share keys.

---++ Account Passwords

Use different passwords for different accounts. Always use good passwords.

---++ Hands-on Training
   *  [[SecurityHandsOnTraining][Security Training]] (from OSG All Hands Meeting, Baron Rouge, LA, Mar 2, 2009)
      * [[BanningUsersAtSite][Banning User DNs at your site]]

---++ Reference Materials
   * NIST Handbook on Computer Security ([[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-12/handbook.pdf][SP800-12]])
