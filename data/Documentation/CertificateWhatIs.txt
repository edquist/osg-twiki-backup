---+ What is a certificate?
---++ Introduction

By "certificate", we mean an X509 digital identity certificate, an
electronic or digital signature that a computer program or service may
require prior to access in order to authenticate the 
person (e.g., you), computer or program that is trying to access it.  

Now, somebody has to issue you a certificate, and somebody else must decide
whether to accept your certificate when you present it. This implies
that there must be a "chain of trust" such that the acceptor trusts
the issuer. The issuer of a certificate is an organization called a
Certificate Authority (CA). A CA will only issue you a certificate upon verification by somebody it already knows and trusts. The acceptors (e.g., grid services), in turn, maintain lists of CAs that they trust.

---++ A little about the technology
Digital certificates are based on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology, an arrangement which provides
for third-party vetting of, and vouching for, user identities. PKI
uses a pair of cryptographic keys (public and private) to encrypt and
decrypt information securely.  To be precise, an X509 _credential_ consists of two parts, the _public certificate_ (which includes a public key) and a _private key_. 

A central principle to this technology is that
the person requesting a certificate generates the public/private key pair and
the private key stays with that person and never shared or made available
for others to copy it.  
Private keys are usually encrypted so that only the
owner, who knows the passphrase for the encryption, can use the private key. By keeping the private key *private*,
communications to third parties can be trusted as having originated with the holder of the private key.  

Any piece of information cryptographically signed with the private key can be verified with the public certificate (using its included public key). In turn, the public certificate is cryptographically signed by the CA so that when the CA is *trusted*, the recipient is assured of the identity of the person holding the private key.

---++ Who and what needs a certificate?

Certificates can pertain to different types of End Entities: persons,
hosts and services, and CAs. Host and service certificates are used to authenticate hosts and services to other grid- and web-related programs, hosts and services. Personal certificates are sometimes
called grid certificates because standard grid software requires
authentication via certificates, but use of certificates is not
restricted to grid computing. Other common uses include signing email
messages and administering/accessing restricted web sites.

---++ Uses of a PERSONAL certificate in OSG

There are three primary uses of certificates around the OSG:
   1. for initiating grid computing transactions (the main purpose)
   2. for authenticating at web sites using your browser
   3. for digitally signing email messages
For the first use, the credential is typically stored in your ~/.globus directory, the public certificate in a file called usercert.pem
and the private key in a file called userkey.pem.
To get one of these credentials it is most convenient to use the comandline tools in the cert-scripts package mentioned below.

For the other uses (web browser & email) it can be more convenient to get another certificate using
the web interface to the DOEGrids CA.  The public/private key pair is generated in your web browser
and the signed certificate, when issued, is downloaded into your (same) web browser, matched with
the private key and then can be used to authenticate with SSL web sites.  Depending upon your
email client tool you may or may not have to export your credential into a PKCS12 file from your
web browser and import it into your email client.  There are also tools to convert PKCS12 format
credentials to/from PEM format files for globus if you want to use exactly the same credential
for all uses, if you prefer to _not_ have two certificates.

---++ Methods for getting a personal certificate
To get one of these credentials for use in OSG it may be most convenient to use the command line tools in the VDT-provided =cert-scripts= package as described in [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCertificate][User Certificate]].

For the other uses (web browser & email) it can be more convenient to get your certificate, or get a second certificate, using
the web interface to the DOEGrids CA.  The public/private key pair is generated in your web browser
and the signed certificate, when issued, is downloaded into your (same) web browser, matched with
the private key and then can be used to authenticate with SSL web sites.  This method is described in [[CertificateGet][How do I get or renew a DOEGrids Digital PKI/X509 Personal Certificate?]].

For encrypting email messages, depending upon your
email client tool you may or may not have to export your credential into a PKCS12 file from your
web browser and import it into your email client.  There are tools to convert PKCS12 format
credentials to/from PEM format files for Globus if you want to use exactly the same credential
for all uses, if you prefer to _not_ have two certificates.
