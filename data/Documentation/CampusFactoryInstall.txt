---+ About This Document
This document describes the installation of the Campus Factory.  The OSG model for setting up a Campus Grid utilizes a Condor based submit host to submit jobs across multiple clusters with different Job Schedulers.  A Campus Grid Factory must be installed on the head node of each non-Condor based cluster as an integration point into the Campus Grid. 

---+ How To Get Help?
You can find support in the !SourceForge project [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/support][support page]]

---+ Requirements
The Campus Grid Factory requires:
   * A supported (LRM) Local Resource Manager (e.g. PBS)
   * A submit host for the LRM with RHEL 5 64 bit (x86_64) based Operating System, a public IP and port 9168 (Condor Collector) open.
      * The hardware recommendations for the Campus Factory are modest: production factories have run on 1GB of ram and 1 Core.

   * The [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/files/][Campus Factory]].
-->

---+ Introduction
The Campus Factory is a component of the OSG Campus Grid Infrastructure.
The Campus Factory allows job submission access to a single job queue (PBS or LSF) by creating allowing Condor jobs to flock into the queue as user jobs owned by the user running the Campus Factory.
The Campus Factory includes a Condor installation (running a Collector) and a process submitting user jobs to the local queue.

---+ Installation Procedure

---++ Installing Condor 

You do not have to install condor as root.  This guide will assume installing as non-root.  The user that runs condor will be the same user which the pilots will be submitted as to PBS.
   1 Go to the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl?state=select_from_mirror_page&version=7.5.6&mirror=UW%20Madison&optional_organization_url=http://][download page]] and choose Condor version %CONDORREL% for RHEL 5 64bit (x86_64).
      *  =condor-%CONDORREL%-x86_64_rhap_5-stripped.tar.gz=  (for RHEL 5 x86_64 OS)
   1 Save the downloaded file to your home directory (you can use =wget= or =curl=).
   1 Create the Condor installation directory: <pre class="screen">
mkdir ~/cf
mkdir ~/cf/condor
</pre>
   1 Create a temporary directory and extract the source from the downloaded file in your home directory<pre class="screen">
mkdir /tmp/condor-src
cd /tmp/condor-src
tar xzf ~/condor-%CONDORREL%-x86_64_rhap_5-stripped.tar.gz 
</pre>
   1 Run the Condor installation script:<pre class="screen">
cd condor-%CONDORREL%-x86_64_rhap_5-stripped
./condor_install --prefix=~/cf/condor </pre>   
<!--
./condor_install --prefix=~/cf/condor --type=manager
-->

The installation script created for you 
   * files to set the environment (=condor.sh/csh=)
   * standard configuration files =~/cr/condor/etc/condor_config= 
   * and a host specific directory =~/cr/condor/local.$HOST= (where $HOST is the short name of your host) containing the machine-specific configuration file and log and spool directories. 


---++ Configuring Condor 
   1. Download and extract the Campus Factory [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/files/][release]]. E.g.:<pre class="screen">
cd ~/cf/
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/files/CampusFactory-%CFREL%/CampusFactory-%CFREL%.tar.gz/download
tar xzf CampusFactory-%CFREL%.tar.gz</pre>
   1. Define =CONDOR_LOCATION= as your Condor installation directory and =FACTORY_LOCATION= as your Campus Factory installation directory:<pre class="screen">
export CONDOR_LOCATION=~/cf/condor
export FACTORY_LOCATION=~/cf/CampusFactory-%CFREL%</pre>
   1. Make a local configuration directory:<pre class="screen">
mkdir $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/config.d</pre>
   1. Edit the required lines in the =condor_config= file (=$CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config=):
      * =LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR= set to =&lt;CONDOR_LOCATION>/etc/config.d=, where lt;CONDOR_LOCATION> is the content of the variable defined above. Use the absolute path, no variables or symbols like =~=. E.g.:<pre class="file">
LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR = /home/marco/cf/condor/etc/config.d</pre>
   1. Copy the =condor_config.factory= and =condor_mapfile= from the factory release.<pre class="screen">
cp $FACTORY_LOCATION/share/condor/condor_config.local $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/config.d/condor_config.factory
cp $FACTORY_LOCATION/share/condor/condor_mapfile $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_mapfile</pre>
   1. Edit the required condor lines in the factory condor configuration file (=condor_config.factory=):
   $ =FLOCK_FROM=: Hosts that will be allowed to run jobs on this cluster
   $ =FLOCK_TO=: Hosts that can run jobs submitted on this cluster.
   $ =INTERNAL_IPS=: IP addresses (or hostnames) of the worker nodes and any NAT machines that the worker nodes may use to contact the =CONDOR_HOST=.
   1. Check the value of these condor lines in the local condor configuration file (=local.$(HOST)/condor_config.local=):
   $ =CONDOR_HOST=: to the full hostname of the machine that will run condor
   $ =CONDOR_ADMIN=: set to the email address that will receive emails about malfunctioning condor.
   $ =UID_DOMAIN=: set to a unique name for this resource.  For example, for a cluster named Firefly at Nebraska, we would set =UID_DOMAIN= to =firefly.unl.edu=
   $ =FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN=: set to your domain.  This can be the same as =UID_DOMAIN=
   $ =COLLECTOR_NAME=: Name of the resource.  This is the long name, such as =Firefly Cluster=
      * A sample configuration with the variables filled in is shown in the source [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/campusfactory/browser/campus_factory/tags/CampusFactory-0.3.1/share/condor/condor_config.local][condor_config.local]].
   1. Edit the Condor PBS Blahp configuration.  This file is located in =$CONDOR_LOCATION/libexec/glite/etc/batch_gahp.config=.
      * Use =which qstat= to find the binary path of the PBS executables (i.e. qstat, qsub, ...), =/usr/bin= in the example
      * Set =pbs_binpath= and these other variables accordingly: <pre class="file">
pbs_binpath=/usr/bin
pbs_nochecksubmission=yes
pbs_nologaccess=yes
blah_shared_directories=/dev/null</pre>
   1. After editing =batch_gahp.config=, copy the file to the new configuration file location:<pre class="screen">
cp $CONDOR_LOCATION/libexec/glite/etc/batch_gahp.config $CONDOR_LOCATION/libexec/glite/etc/blah.config </pre>
 

---++ Starting condor
Start the Condor daemons by first sourcing the setup file =condor.sh=:<pre class="screen">
source $CONDOR_LOCATION/condor.sh</pre>

Then starting the =condor_master=:<pre class="screen">
condor_master</pre>


---++ Installing the factory 
The Campus Factory is the package downloaded above during the Condor configuration.
=$FACTORY_LOCATION= was defined above as the Campus Factory installation directory.

---++ Configuring the factory
Full documentation on configuration options for the factory are listed on the [wiki:Configuration Configuration page].
In the configuration file =$FACTORY_LOCATION/etc/campus_factory.conf=, the values you are required to change are:

   $ =worker_tmp=: The local temp directory on the worker node.  This will be where condor places the intermediate job data and glidein logs.
   $ =logdirectory=: Directory to place the logs for the factory.  They will be named campus_factory.log.

---++ Starting the Factory
   1. Confirm that the condor executables are in your path:
   <pre class="screen">
condor_q</pre>
   Should output
   <pre class="screen">
-- Schedd: HOSTNAME : <IP_ADDRESS>
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               

0 jobs; 0 idle, 0 running, 0 held </pre>
   If =condor_q= failes, be sure to source the condor.sh file you created while [[#Installing_Condor][installing condor]].  If sourcing the =condor.sh= file does not fix the problem, confirm that the =condor_master=, =condor_collector=, and =condor_schedd= daemons are running.
   <pre class="screen">
ps aux | grep condor</pre>
   1. Export the correct python path:
   <pre class="screen">
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:FACTORY_LOCATION/python-lib </pre>
   1. Start the factory:
   <pre class="screen">
cd FACTORY_LOCATION
condor_submit share/factory.job </pre>
