---+ About This Document
This document describes the installation of the Campus Factory.  The OSG model for setting up a Campus Grid utilizes a Condor based submit host to submit jobs across multiple clusters with different Job Schedulers.  A Campus Grid Factory must be installed on the head node of each non-Condor based cluster as an integration point into the Campus Grid. 

---+ How To Get Help?
You can find support in the !SourceForge project [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/support][support page]]

---+ Requirements
The Campus Grid Factory requires:
   * A supported (LRM) Local Resource Manager (e.g. PBS)
   * A submit host for the LRM with RHEL 5 64 bit (x86_64) based Operating System, a public IP and port 9618 (Condor Collector) open.
      * The hardware recommendations for the Campus Factory are modest: production factories have run on 1GB of ram and 1 Core.

   * The [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/files/][Campus Factory]].
-->

---+ Introduction
The Campus Factory is a component of the OSG Campus Grid Infrastructure.

The Campus Factory allows job submission access to a single job queue (PBS or LSF) by creating an overlay allowing Condor jobs to flock into the queue as PBS user jobs owned by the user running the Campus Factory.

The Campus Factory includes a Condor installation (running a Negotiator and Collector) and a process submitting user jobs to the local PBS queue.

In order to submit jobs to the Campus Factory you need a Condor submit host. You can install a dedicated one or you can modify an existing one to flock to the Campus Factory. Check the [[#Next_Steps][Next Steps section]] at the end of this document.

For more information about the Campus Factory structure check the [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/campusfactory][introduction on !SourceForge]].

---+ Installation Procedure

---++ Installing Condor 

You do not have to install condor as root.  This guide will assume installing as non-root.  The user that runs condor will be the same user which the pilots will be submitted as to PBS.
   1 Go to the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl?state=select_from_mirror_page&version=7.5.6&mirror=UW%20Madison&optional_organization_url=http://][download page]] and choose Condor version %CONDORREL% for RHEL 5 64bit (x86_64).
      *  =condor-%CONDORREL%-x86_64_rhap_5-stripped.tar.gz=  (for RHEL 5 x86_64 OS)
   1 Save the downloaded file to your home directory (you can use =wget= or =curl=).
   1 Create the Condor installation directory: <pre class="screen">
mkdir ~/cf
mkdir ~/cf/condor
</pre>
   1 Create a temporary directory and extract the source from the downloaded file in your home directory<pre class="screen">
mkdir /tmp/condor-src
cd /tmp/condor-src
tar xzf ~/condor-%CONDORREL%-x86_64_rhap_5-stripped.tar.gz 
</pre>
   1 Run the Condor installation script (note that Condor cannot resolve '~'. Use variables or absolute path):<pre class="screen">
cd condor-%CONDORREL%-x86_64_rhap_5-stripped
./condor_install --prefix=$HOME/cf/condor </pre>   
<!--
./condor_install --prefix=~/cf/condor --type=manager
-->

The installation script created for you 
   * files to set the environment (=condor.sh/csh=)
   * standard configuration files =~/cr/condor/etc/condor_config= 
   * and a host specific directory =~/cr/condor/local.$HOST= (where $HOST is the short name of your host) containing the machine-specific configuration file and log and spool directories. 


---++ Configuring Condor 
These instructions cover only the configuration of a Campus Factory for a PBS job queue

   1. Download and extract the Campus Factory [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/files/][release]]. E.g.:<pre class="screen">
cd ~/cf/
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/campusfactory/files/CampusFactory-%CFREL%/CampusFactory-%CFREL%.tar.gz/download
tar xzf CampusFactory-%CFREL%.tar.gz</pre>
   1. Define =CONDOR_LOCATION= as your Condor installation directory and =FACTORY_LOCATION= as your Campus Factory installation directory:<pre class="screen">
export CONDOR_LOCATION=~/cf/condor
export FACTORY_LOCATION=~/cf/CampusFactory-%CFREL%</pre>
   1. Make a local configuration directory:<pre class="screen">
mkdir $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/config.d</pre>
   1. Edit the required lines in the =condor_config= file (=$CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config=):
      * =LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR= set to =&lt;CONDOR_LOCATION>/etc/config.d=, where &lt;CONDOR_LOCATION> is the content of the variable defined above. Use the absolute path, no variables or symbols like =~=. E.g.:<pre class="file">
LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR = /home/marco/cf/condor/etc/config.d</pre>
   1. Edit the required lines in the =condor_config.local= file (=$CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config.local=):
      * =DAEMON_LIST=  set to =COLLECTOR=, =NEGOTIATOR=, =SCHEDD=.  This tells Condor to run the COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, and SCHEDD on the factory node.<pre class="file">
DAEMON_LIST = COLLECTOR, NEGOTIATOR, SCHEDD</pre>
   1. Copy the =condor_config.factory= and =condor_mapfile= from the factory release.<pre class="screen">
cp $FACTORY_LOCATION/share/condor/condor_config.local $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/config.d/condor_config.factory
cp $FACTORY_LOCATION/share/condor/condor_mapfile $CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_mapfile</pre>
   1. Edit the required condor lines in the factory condor configuration file (=condor_config.factory=):
      $ =FLOCK_FROM=: Hosts that will be allowed to run jobs on this cluster
      $ =INTERNAL_IPS=: IP addresses (or hostnames) of the worker nodes and any NAT machines that the worker nodes may use to contact the =CONDOR_HOST=.
   1. Optional parameters in the factory condor configuration file (=condor_config.factory=):
      $ =FLOCK_TO=: Hosts that can run jobs submitted on this cluster. I would allow to daisy-chain this Campus Factory to another Campus Factory or Condor cluster.
   1. Check the value of these condor lines in the local condor configuration file (=local.$(HOST)/condor_config.local=). Condor's setup should have been set these for you:
      $ =CONDOR_HOST=: to the full hostname of the machine that will run condor
      $ =CONDOR_ADMIN=: set to the email address that will receive emails about malfunctioning condor.
      $ =UID_DOMAIN=: set to a unique name for this resource.  For example, for a cluster named Firefly at Nebraska, we would set =UID_DOMAIN= to =firefly.unl.edu=
      $ =FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN=: set to your domain.  This can be the same as =UID_DOMAIN=
      $ =COLLECTOR_NAME=: Name of the resource.  This is the long name, such as =FireflyCluster=. %RED% Please choose a single identifier (no spaces).%ENDCOLOR%
      * A sample configuration with the variables filled in is shown in the source [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/campusfactory/browser/campus_factory/tags/CampusFactory-0.3.1/share/condor/condor_config.local][condor_config.local]].
   1. Add to the Condor configuration the =NETWORK_INTERFACE= option.  This will cause Condor to bind and advertise the public IP address.  Set the value to the Public IP address of the factory. <pre class="file">
NETWORK_INTERFACE = &lt;ip_address></pre>
   1. Comment out the =DAEMON_LIST= variable in condor_config.local.
   1. Edit the Condor PBS Blahp configuration.  This file is located in =$CONDOR_LOCATION/libexec/glite/etc/batch_gahp.config=.
      * Use =which qstat= to find the binary path of the PBS executables (i.e. qstat, qsub, ...), =/usr/bin= in the example
      * Set =pbs_binpath= and these other variables accordingly: <pre class="file">
pbs_binpath=/usr/bin
pbs_nochecksubmission=yes
pbs_nologaccess=yes
blah_shared_directories=/dev/null</pre>
   1. After editing =batch_gahp.config=, copy the file to the new configuration file location:<pre class="screen">
cp $CONDOR_LOCATION/libexec/glite/etc/batch_gahp.config $CONDOR_LOCATION/libexec/glite/etc/blah.config </pre>

---+++ Configuring GAHP for other job managers

---++ Starting condor
Start the Condor daemons by first sourcing the setup file =condor.sh=:<pre class="screen">
source $CONDOR_LOCATION/condor.sh</pre>

Then starting the =condor_master=:<pre class="screen">
condor_master</pre>


---++ Installing the factory 
The Campus Factory is the package downloaded above during the Condor configuration.
=$FACTORY_LOCATION= was defined above as the Campus Factory installation directory.

---++ Configuring the factory
Create a log directory for the log files of the factory (e.g. =/tmp/cf-logs=).

Full documentation on configuration options for the factory are listed on the [[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/campusfactory/wiki/Configuration][Configuration page on !SourceForge]].
In the configuration file =$FACTORY_LOCATION/etc/campus_factory.conf=, the values you are required to change are:
   $ =worker_tmp=: The local temp directory on the worker node.  This will be where condor places the intermediate job data and glidein logs.  This should be an existing directory on the worker node.  An example is =/tmp=
   $ =logdirectory=: Directory to place the logs for the factory.  They will be named campus_factory.log. It is recommended to use a local directory.

The job template =$FACTORY_LOCATION//share/glidein_jobs/job.submit.template= needs to be configured correctly:
   1. Set these variables to the correct value:<pre class="file">
GLIDEIN_HOST = example.com
WN_TMP = /tmp
GLIDEIN_Site = Grid site</pre>
   1. Customize the environment for your configuration:<pre class="file">
Environment =   _condor_CONDOR_HOST=$(GLIDEIN_HOST); &#92;
                                _condor_COLLECTOR_HOST=$(GLIDEIN_HOST); &#92;
                                _condor_GLIDEIN_HOST=$(GLIDEIN_HOST); &#92;
                                _condor_CONDOR_ADMIN=dweitzel@ff.unl.edu; &#92;
                                _condor_NUM_CPUS=1; &#92;
                                _condor_UID_DOMAIN=ff.unl.edu; &#92;
                                _condor_FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN=ff.unl.edu; &#92;
                                _condor_MAIL=/bin/mail; &#92;
                                _condor_STARTD_NOCLAIM_SHUTDOWN=1200; &#92;
                                _campusfactory_wntmp=$(WN_TMP); &#92;
                                _condor_GLIDEIN_Site="$(GLIDEIN_Site)"</pre>


---++ Starting the Factory
   1. Confirm that the condor executables are in your path:
   <pre class="screen">
condor_q</pre>
   Should output
   <pre class="screen">
-- Schedd: HOSTNAME : <IP_ADDRESS>
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               

0 jobs; 0 idle, 0 running, 0 held </pre>
   If =condor_q= failes, be sure to source the condor.sh file you created while [[#Installing_Condor][installing condor]].  If sourcing the =condor.sh= file does not fix the problem, confirm that the =condor_master=, =condor_collector=, and =condor_schedd= daemons are running.
   <pre class="screen">
ps aux | grep condor</pre>
   1. Export the correct python path:
   <pre class="screen">
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$FACTORY_LOCATION/python-lib </pre>
   1. Start the factory:
   <pre class="screen">
cd $FACTORY_LOCATION
condor_submit share/factory.job </pre>

---++ Advanced configuration

---+++ Campus Factory behind a firewall or on a private network
In order to flock into the Campus Factory both the Glidein on the worker nodes and the submit host(s) must be able to reach port 9618 on it (Condor Collector):
   * port 9618 must be open
   * the host must have a public IP (or at least be reachable by both worker nodes and submit host(s))
As user you may have no control on the PBS submit host where you are installing the Campus Factory and sometime one of the 2 requirements may not be met.

The solution is to install the Condor Collector and Negotiator for the Campus Factory on a different host. This can be a submit host or a third host with just the Condor Collector and Negotiator.

To make these instructions more generic we will present the second configuration.

---++ File Locations

---++ Known Errors
Here a list of known problems with version 3.1 of the Campus Factory. They will be solved in future releases.

In the Condor Campus Factory configuration file () comment the lines:<pre class="file">
# Location of the PBS_GAHP to be used to submit the glideins.
#GLITE_LOCATION = $(LIB)/glite
#PBS_GAHP       = $(GLITE_LOCATION)/bin/batch_gahp
</pre>
These line are already present in the global Condor configuration and the =GLITE_LOCATION= should be =$(LIBEXEC)/glite=.

---+++ BLAH requires jobs in C state
After job completion PBS normally removes the jobs. BLAH requires the jobs to remain in the job list in "C" (complete) state for at least 5 min (the time between checks from Condor). 
This can be achieved changing the PBS configuration to [[http://www.clusterresources.com/torquedocs21/2.5completedjobs.shtml][keep completed jobs]]. E.g. for the queue named MYQUEUE: <pre class="rootscreen">
qmgr -c "set queue MYQUEUE keep_completed=300"
</pre>
This will allow also better error tracking.

---++ How can I resolve this Problem?

---+++ Testing PBS
Here a simple test job =pbs-test.sub= <pre>
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -W stagein=input5.txt@itbv-pbs:/home/marco/input.txt
hostname
ls
cat input5.txt
</pre>
Instead of =itbv-pbs:/home/marco/input.txt= substitute node and file that PBS can stage in.

Here are some useful commands that you can use to troubleshoot and investigate a job or the PBS nodes:
   * =qsub pbs-test.sub= to submit the job
   * =qstat= to check the queue
      * =qstat -f JOB_ID= for more details about the job. The JOB_ID is the number returned during submission
   * =tracejob= 
   * =diagnose -j jobid= 
   * =qalter -h n jobid= to remove from hold a job (other statuses are possible)
   * =qrun= to force a job to run
      * =qrerun=
   * =diagnose -n= to print debug information about the nodes

Common reasons why PBS jobs may not run:
   * problems in the staging of the files:
      * try a job without staging
      * check in the node pbs-mom (torque) configuration the command used to stage the files and if there are different commands for different directories. Remember that Condor will probably resolve symbolic links into the actual path.
      * the default copy command is =scp=. Try if password-less =scp= between the submit node and the worker nodes work

---+++ How does Condor look?
Here the Condor services on the submit host (=ui-gwms=):<pre class="screen">
-bash-3.2$ condor_status -any

---+++ Errors in the Campus Factory log file
If you see an error about the schedd query failing, like:<pre>

</pre>

Probably there are no glidein jobs running on your system.
   * Check that PSB works correctly (qsub, qstat)
   * Check that GLITE_LOCATION is set correctly. See above for the known bug, control that the files in the glite directory are actually there, else you may have a wrong version of Condor or may need to apply a patch
