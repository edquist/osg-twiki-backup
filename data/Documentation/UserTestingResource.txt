---+!! Testing Your First Resource
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++ About This Document
This page will cover three things:
   * Initializing your grid environment
   * Simple certificate management and verifying your grid credential
   * Sending a debug job to test the remote CE

---++ Requirements
We assume:

a) You have the details of a CE that supports your VO. If you don't have a CE to test against, please use the [[FindAvailableResource][guide for finding resources]] to find one that supports your VO.  The document below uses =osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu= as the example CE.

b) You or a system administrator have already installed the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG client]].  As a part of this, you must know the top-level client install directory, called =<i>VDT_LOCATION</i>=.

---++  Procedure

---+++ Initializing your grid environment

To initialize the grid environment, source the =setup.[c]sh= script in =$<i>VDT_LOCATION</i>=.  You will need to execute one of the following commands.

For bash shell:
<pre class="printview">
source <i>VDT_LOCATION</i>/setup.sh
</pre>
For csh:
<pre class="printview">
source <i>VDT_LOCATION</i>/setup.csh
</pre>
%NOTE% You will need to replace =<i>VDT_LOCATION</i>= above with your top-level install directory.

---+++ Simple certificate management and verifying your grid credential

Your grid credential will be used to authenticate with every service provided by the CE. The authentication is based on the =X.509 Public Key Infrastructure= which consists of a private key (=userkey.pem=) and a public key (=usercert.pem=). Both files are by default located in =$HOME/.globus=:

%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show sample directory listing..."
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ ls -al $HOME/.globus
total 68
drwxr-x---  4 robert robert  4096 Mar 18 18:50 .
drwx------ 29 robert robert 12288 Jul 28 08:38 ..
drwxrwxr-x  5 robert robert  4096 Jul 20 11:18 .gass_cache
drwx------  4 robert robert  4096 Mar 27 12:14 job
-rw-r-----  1 robert robert  1724 Dec 16  2008 usercert.pem
-r--------  1 robert robert  1919 Dec 16  2008 userkey.pem
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%
<br/>

To create a proxy (a token required to use the grid) you can use the  =grid-proxy-init= tool e.g.:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ grid-proxy-init -valid 500:00
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Robert Engel 392994
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until: Tue Aug 18 08:06:35 2009
</pre>

Alternately, some VOs require you to use the =voms-proxy-init= command line instead.  The command-line usage of this includes an extra argument:

<pre class="userinput">
voms-proxy-init --voms <i>voname</i>:/<i>voname</i>
</pre>

If you are unsure, check with your VO manager to see which one (=grid-proxy-init= or =voms-proxy-init=) you should use.

To display detailed information about your grid certificate =grid-proxy-info= can be used:

%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show sample command output..."
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ grid-proxy-info
subject  : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Robert Engel 392994/CN=1692124231

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

---+++ Sending a debug job to test the remote CE

A program can be executed remotely on OSG CE.  To verify that a grid endpoint will accept jobs from you and will be useful for the rest of the grid guide, one can use =globus-job-run=.  The usage we'll demonstrate is simple:

<pre class="userinput">
globus-job-run <i>hostname</i>:/jobmanager-<i>name</i> /path/to/executable
</pre>

For test jobs (lasting a few seconds), you can use =jobmanager-fork=.  For determining the jobmanager for all other jobs, use the  [[FindAvailableResource][guide for finding resources]] (other valid jobmanager names on the OSG are condor, pbs, lsf, or sge; each site will usually run one of these).

An example for running the 'id' binary follows:
<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-job-run osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu:/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

---++ Conclusion

After following this guide, you should be able to run a single executable on a remote CE.  This allows you to see if the CE is usable for your VO - sometimes you will encounter resources that will advertise support for your VO, but have some broken interfaces.  You should use the CE you just tested through the remainder of the guides.

Running a single executable is of limited scientific use - the point of =globus-job-run= is primarily debugging.  In the next guide, we will cover job submission using Condor-G, which allows one to accomplish large-scale workflows.
