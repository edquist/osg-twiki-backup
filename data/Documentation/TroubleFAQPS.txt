Here  we  will  provide  details on  troubleshooting  perfSONAR  installations  for  OSG and WLCG  as well  as  a FAQ.

There are a good set of  =cli=  tools  for  perfSONAR  available.  Details on these  tools are at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/NetworkPerformanceToolkit    The  =owping= and =bwctl= tools  can  be  very useful  to test from your location  to  any perfSONAR instance running either  the  OWAMP or BWCTL  services  respectively.
