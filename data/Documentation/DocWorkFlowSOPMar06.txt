---+ Documentation Workflow (WIP 13Mar06)

OED  _documentation_: %GREEN% 3b. The accumulation, classification, and dissemination of information; the material so collected. %ENDCOLOR%

Perhaps "Documentation Workflow" is redundant.

---++ Categories of Documentation
They don't all have the same process so let's categorize the documentation.
I think these are the categories we have today, and we may want to refine
the categories in the future.
	* _Published_ - The material we think is complete, final and accurate, and usually has access control on it. Usually about describing the state of the Consortium or the state of a software release. E.g. web pages under www.opensciencegrid.org, some documents declared published in the !DocDB. Decision to publish made by management or at the osg-docs meetings.
	* _ITB_ - software, service and instructional material under active development. Generally loose access control. A major product of the Integration activity.
	* _Release Prep_ - also called provisioining, material being prepared to be published for a particular OSG software & service release. Controlled access by the Provisioning leads.
	* _Draft_ - other material being prepared but not yet published. Usually controlled by author.
	* _Working_ - material usually for the "internal" business of some group, like the current page you are reading. Usually loose access control. Typically pages on the OSG TWiki, and email messages.
	

---++ Categories of Readers
They don't all have the same audience so let's  categorize the types of readers.

	* _Public_ - the general public
	* _Users_ - members of VOs using OSG
	* _VOs_ - VO managers or administrators who deal with the interaction of the VO with OSG
	* _Administrators_ - also called site admins, people who manage or administer a resource or service connected to OSG
	* _Participants_ - someone actively involved with the functioning of OSG, includes OSG Facility, support center people, many of the VO members, and resource/service providers, and some middleware developers.

---++ Use Cases

	1. _Draft_ material developed on osg.grid.iu.edu/dev and _published_ on www.opensciencegrid.org
	2. Material developed for a software release, goes from _ITB_ to _Release Prep_ to _Published_
		* single document
		* aggregation of inter-dependant documents
	3. Meeting minutes are posted as _Working_ material.

---++Procedures

Note that the draft procedures described below do not yet have the various timescales included that may apply.

---+++ Case 1: New document: draft and publish

%ATTACHURL%/docs-mar06-uc1.gif

	1. Decide to create and publish new document
		* Who decides?
		* Description is sent to osg-docs mail list.
	2. Purpose and planning
		* The purpose of document is discussed at osg-docs meeting
		* A location for publication is chosen, i.e., where under www.opensciencegrid.org
		* A primary author is chosen/appointed/volunteered,...
		* A deadline/schedule is defined
	3. Create Template
		* If it is a new page on the www.opensciencegrid.org mambo site then then administrator creates a new template page on the development site (osg.grid.iu.edu/dev) and notifies the primary author.
	4. Write/edit document
		* the primary author writes the first version of the document, or revises an existing version, on the development site
		* author sends mail to osg-docs when it is ready for review
	5. Review document
		* review of documetn handled by email on osg-docs list or at osg-docs meeting
	6. Decide if ready for publication
		* A decision is made at an osg-docs meeting, or on the osg-docs email list
		* if ready then it will be published
		* if not ready then go back to step 4 and continue to edit
		* (Isn't everything published in a db sync for mambo, regardless of the state of various pages?)
	7. Publish
		* mambo web pages are published from teh dev site to the main site at the next db sync
		* (Isn't everything published in a db sync for mambo, regardless of the state of various pages?)

---+++ Case 2a: Prepare single release document

%ATTACHURL%/docs-mar06-uc2a.gif

	1. Decide a document is needed
		* usually in the ITB context
	2. Write Readiness Plan
		* If document is stimulated by new service then new readiness plan is needed
		* Document might not be service specific, such as Client Install Guide, in which case this step is only an abstract of the needed document for an Integration meeting.
	3. Decide if Ready for OTB
		* Decision at ITB meeting or on osg-int mail list that document is needed
		* Identify primary author
		* Define deadline/schedule
		* Decide location of document on Integration TWiki
	4. Write/edit document
		* the primary author writes or edits the document
	5. Review document
		* Depending on length & complexity of the document it may be reviewed at an Integration meeting, or there may be people who volunteer/get assigned to review document and report at meeting or on email list
	6. Decide if Ready for Provisioning
		* Decide at an Integration meeting if document is ready as a description for a specific software release
		* If ready, the ITB document is frozen pending receipt by Provisioning
		* If not ready, the authors update the document, at step 4 and process continues.
	7. Ready for Provisioning
		* A notice that this specific document is ready is sent to Provisioning

---+++ Case 2b: Provisioning documents

%ATTACHURL%/docs-mar06-uc2b.gif

	1. Receive notice from Integration that documents are ready
		* establishing the provisioning workforce/workplan for a release happens before this
	2. Copy from ITB to Provisioning location
		* Most (all?) documents are copied from the Integration TWiki to the Provisioning TWiki
		* Notice is sent to Integration when documents have been copied
	3. Edit
		* documents are modified to fix links to other release documents that may have been confused by the copy processes
		* style and/or formatting changes to fit publication standards (do we have publication standards?)
		* done by provisioning workforce
		* iterations of edits must be fed back to ITB documents
	4. Verify links & consistency
		* after all documents have been editted, perform a check that all links are correct and internally consistent
		* done by provisioning workforce
	5. Review documents
		* a quick review to verify the link consistency and assure that edits have not adversely affected content of documents
		* performed by people outside the provisioning workforce
		* for 0.4.0 this happened only by few people incl. provisioning folks
	6. Decide if documents are ready for publication
		* (who does this?  Integration?)
		* for 0.4.0 this was an implicit step by provisioning people
		* because of copy from ITB, changes now must get fed back to ITB
	7. Prepare publication point
		* Decide where documents get published and what modifications are necessary to existing published documentation
		* Must include release identification
		* who decides? osg-docs?
	8. Copy to publication point
		* copy the documents from the Provisioning TWiki to the publication point
		* done by the provisioning workforce
	9. Review all documents
		* who does it?
		* really happens by early installers providing feedback
		* reviewing proofs
	10. Ready for publication?
		* decide that "published" version of documents are ready to publish
		* who does this? osg-docs?
		* If not ready then provisioning workforce (or someone) fixes the documents and they are checked again (step 9).
		* If ready, do publish
	11. Fix
		* fix any mistakes
	12. Publish
		* the documents are published


Burt - prefered changes, don't do copy step 2, but prepare publication form on ITB site.

Doug will draw up intended workflow for 0.4.1.
