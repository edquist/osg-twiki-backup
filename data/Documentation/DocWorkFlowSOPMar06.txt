---+ Documentation Workflow (WIP 13Mar06)

OED  _documentation_: %GREEN% 3b. The accumulation, classification, and dissemination of information; the material so collected. %ENDCOLOR%

Perhaps "Documentation Workflow" is redundant.

---++ Categories of Documentation
They don't all have the same process so let's categorize the documentation.
I think these are the categories we have today, and we may want to refine
the categories in the future.
	* _Published_ - The material we think is complete, final and accurate, and usually has access control on it. Usually about describing the state of the Consortium or the state of a software release. E.g. web pages under www.opensciencegrid.org, some documents declared published in the !DocDB. Decision to publish made by management or at the osg-docs meetings.
	* _ITB_ - software, service and instructional material under active development. Generally loose access control. A major product of the Integration activity.
	* _Release Prep_ - also called provisioining, material being prepared to be published for a particular OSG software & service release. Controlled access by the Provisioning leads.
	* _Draft_ - other material being prepared but not yet published. Usually controlled by author.
	* _Working_ - material usually for the "internal" business of some group, like the current page you are reading. Usually loose access control. Typically pages on the OSG TWiki, and email messages.
	

---++ Categories of Readers
They don't all have the same audience so let's  categorize the types of readers.

	* _Public_ - the general public
	* _Users_ - members of VOs using OSG
	* _VOs_ - VO managers or administrators who deal with the interaction of the VO with OSG
	* _Administrators_ - also called site admins, people who manage or administer a resource or service connected to OSG
	* _Participants_ - someone actively involved with the functioning of OSG, includes OSG Facility, support center people, many of the VO members, and resource/service providers, and some middleware developers.

---++ Use Cases

	1. _Draft_ material developed on osg.grid.iu.edu/dev and _published_ on www.opensciencegrid.org
	2. Material developed for a software release, goes from _ITB_ to _Release Prep_ to _Published_
		* single document
		* aggregation of inter-dependant documents
	3. Meeting minutes are posted as _Working_ material.

---++Procedures

Note that the draft procedures described below do not yet have the various timescales included that may apply.

---+++ Case 1: New document: draft and publish

%ATTACHURL%/docs-mar06-uc1.gif

	1. Decide to create and publish new document
		* Who decides?
		* Description is sent to osg-docs mail list.
	2. Purpose and planning
		* The purpose of document is discussed at osg-docs meeting
		* A location for publication is chosen, i.e., where under www.opensciencegrid.org
		* A primary author is chosen/appointed/volunteered,...
		* A deadline/schedule is defined
	3. Create Template
		* If it is a new page on the www.opensciencegrid.org mambo site then then administrator creates a new template page on the development site (osg.grid.iu.edu/dev) and notifies the primary author.
	4. Write/edit document
		* the primary author writes the first version of the document, or revises an existing version, on the development site
		* author sends mail to osg-docs when it is ready for review
	5. Review document
		* review of documetn handled by email on osg-docs list or at osg-docs meeting
	6. Decide if ready for publication
		* A decision is made at an osg-docs meeting, or on the osg-docs email list
		* if ready then it will be published
		* if not ready then go back to step 4 and continue to edit
		* (Isn't everything published in a db sync for mambo, regardless of the state of various pages?)
	7. Publish
		* mambo web pages are published from teh dev site to the main site at the next db sync
		* (Isn't everything published in a db sync for mambo, regardless of the state of various pages?)
