This page documents installing or upgrading *perfSONAR* for OSG and WLCG sites.  In case this is the first time you're trying to install and integrate your perfSONAR into WLCG or OSG, please consult https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/PSMotivation for an overview of perfSONAR.

For any questions or help with WLCG perfSONAR setup, please email =wlcg-perfsonar-support 'at' cern.ch= or open GGUS ticket for [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS:WLCG_perfSONAR_FAQ][WLCG perfSONAR Monitoring Support Unit]]. We strongly recommend anyone maintaining/using perfSONAR to join https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-user and https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-announce

Please follow the instructions for  [[#UpgradeGuide][upgrading]] or [[#InstallingperfSONAR][installing]] perfSONAR as appropriate for your plans.

#UpgradeGuide  
---++ Upgrading perfSONAR

Before updating, please read the release notes at  http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_update.html#special-upgrade-notes 

To update please run the following:
<verbatim>
# yum clean all
# yum update
# reboot
</verbatim> 

Note, it's *very important to reboot* otherwise your update is incomplete.    Please also note, that starting from v3.4 =yum= auto-updates are turned on by default.  *We strongly recommend keeping them turned on*.    With =yum= auto-updates in place there is a possibility that updated packages can "break" your perfSONAR install but this is viewed an acceptable risk in order to have security updates quickly applied on perfSONAR instances.

If you haven't yet added another (=non-root=) user to administer the web interface, you should run =/usr/lib/perfsonar/scripts/nptoolkit-configure.py= and do so, as suggested in =motd=. See http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_users.html for detailed instructions.

Please backup your old =/etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf= file and replace it with =/etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf.rpmnew=.

Then please verify/reconfigure your boxes following [[#ConfigPS][OSG and WLCG Configuration]].  For any further questions, please consult [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/TroubleFAQPS][Troubleshooting]] pages, perfSONAR documentation (http://docs.perfsonar.net) or contact directly WLCG or OSG perfSONAR support units. 

#InstallingperfSONAR
---++ Installing perfSONAR

perfSONAR 4.0 was released in April 2017.   For sites running the previous version (3.x.y) the update should have automatically happened assuming that yum auto-updates were enabled and the =/etc/yum.repos.d/Internet2.repo= had 'enabled = 1'.   

The following information details how to install perfSONAR 4.0 for WLCG and OSG. For general troubleshooting please go [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/TroubleFAQPS][here]], in case you have any questions please email =wlcg-perfsonar-support 'at' cern.ch= or open GGUS ticket for [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/GGUS:WLCG_perfSONAR_FAQ][WLCG perfSONAR support unit]]. For OSG sites that don't participate in WLCG, please contact [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/WebHome][OSG operations]]. 

The perfSONAR team has created very good documentation on the process.   You can get information about your installation options at http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_getting.html#gettingchooseinstall


---+++ Installation
   * For sites using perfSONAR Net Install - please follow http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_centos_netinstall.html#step-by-step-guide
   * For sites using perfSONAR Full Install - please follow http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_centos_fullinstall.html#step-by-step-guide
   * For general configuration of perfSONAR - please follow http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_config_first_time.html

For sites the are currently registered but not yet updated to 4.0 we would strongly recommend reinstalling using CentOS 7.x (follow either the Full Install or the Net Install above).  There is no need for sites to preserve their data from the OSG/WLCG perspective, since we have already been collecting your data centrally.  The primary reason for this recommendation is that the next point release of perfSONAR (version 4.1) will no longer support RHEL6/CentOS6/Scientific Linux 6 as a supported operating system.

#ConfigPS
---++ OSG and WLCG Configuration Notes
All perfSONAR instances for use in OSG and WLCG should be registered either in OIM or GOCDB.  Please verify or register your instances at:
   * For OSG, follow the details in [[RegisterPSinOIM][OIM]]
   * For Non-OSG, follow the details in  [[PerfSONARInGOCDB][GOCDB]]

Please ensure you have added or updated your administrative information: http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_admin_info.html
      * Adding communities is optional, but we recommend putting in WLCG as well as your VO: =ATLAS=, =CMS=, etc.   This just helps others from the community lookup your instances in the lookup service.  As noted in the documentation you can select from already registered communities as appropriate.

You will need to configure your instance(s) to use the OSG/WLCG mesh-configuration.   OSG provides MCA (Mesh Configuration  Adminstrator) GUI (see http://docs.perfsonar.net/mca.html for details) to centrally define the network tests that need to be run.  Each perfSONAR toolkit installation for OSG/WLCG should add the "auto" mesh URL in their =/etc/perfsonar/meshconfig-agent.conf= file:
      * Set this to =http://meshconfig.grid.iu.edu/pub/auto/&lt;FQDN&gt;=    Replace =&lt;FQDN&gt;= with the fully qualified domain name of your host, e.g., =psum01.aglt2.org=.  
      * <verbatim>
<mesh>
      configuration_url http://meshconfig.grid.iu.edu/pub/auto/psum01.aglt2.org
      validate_certificate 0
      required 1
</mesh>
# Replace the following with suitable values for your installation
address   psum01.aglt2.org
admin_email    smckee@umich.edu
skip_redundant_tests   1
</verbatim>

We *strongly recommend* configuring perfSONAR in *dual-stack mode* (both IPv4 and IPv6) 
      * In case your site has IPv6 support, the only necessary step is to get both A and AAAA records for your perfSONAR DNS names (as well as ensuring the reverse is in place).
      * All existing meshes will support both IPv4 and IPv6 testing.  Sites with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses testing to sites that also have both will run *two* tests.   A side effect of this is that as more sites provide IPv6 addresses, the amount of testing will increase.  
      * At some future point when most sites have IPv6, we may need to adjust the testing frequency to reduce the overall amount of testing
      * For more information on IPv6 see http://ipv6.web.cern.ch/

---++++ Security Considerations

The perfSONAR toolkit is reviewed both internally and externally for security flaws.   The toolkit's purpose is to allow us to measure and diagnose network problems and we therefore need to be cautious about blocking needed functionality by site or host firewalls.     

Some sites are concerned about having port 80 and/or 443 open.  The working group would like to emphasize that these ports provide access to the perfSONAR web interface and are very useful to users and network administrators.   *Our recommendation is to keep them open*, but for sites with strong concerns we have some rules documented below to customize  iptables to block ports 80 and 443.  It is *required* that either port 80 *or* port 443 be accessible from the  OSG and WLCG monitoring subnets shown below:
      <verbatim>
# Allow HTTP/HTTPS only from our monitoring subnets and your site's subnets 
# Replace <LOCAL_SUBNET> with your site subnet/netmask, e.g. 193.87.10.0/255.255.255.0 or 193.87.10.0/24
# OSG monitoring subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s 129.79.53.0/24 -j ACCEPT
# CERN subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s 137.138.0.0/17 -j ACCEPT
# Infrastructure monitoring (hosted at AGLT2)
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s 192.41.231.110/32 -j ACCEPT
# Replace <LOCAL_SUBNET> appropriately to allow access from your local systems
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 443 -s <LOCAL_SUBNET> -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REJECT

#OSG monitoring subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s 129.79.53.0/24 -j ACCEPT
# CERN subnet
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s 137.138.0.0/17 -j ACCEPT
# Infrastructure monitoring (hosted at AGLT2)
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s 192.41.231.110/32 -j ACCEPT
# Replace <LOCAL_SUBNET> appropriately to allow access from your local systems
iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 80 -s <LOCAL_SUBNET> -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REJECT

/sbin/service iptables save
   </verbatim>

In case you have *central/campus firewall*, please ensure the following ports are opened on it for all your perfSONAR hosts:
   <verbatim>
# General purpose ports needed to do perfSONAR measurements
ICMP/type 255, 
NTP UDP port:123, 
TRACEROUTE/PING UDP ports: 33434-33634
OWAMP TCP port:861, UDP ports: 8760-9960
BWCTL TCP ports: 4823, 6001-6200, 5000-5900  UDP ports: 6001-6200, 5000-5900 

# HTTP and/or HTTPS ports are needed to access your perfSONAR web interface 
# and the measurement archive and to check availability of your instances by the infrastructure monitoring
# At a minimum either port 80 or 443 *must* be open to the WLCG monitoring subnets.  
# Our recommendation is to have either HTTP or HTTPS open to allow users and network admins access to the perfSONAR web.
HTTP/HTTPS ports 80,443 - open to ALL or at least for the following
source subnets OSG_NET (129.79.53.0/24), AGLT2_NET (192.41.231.110/32) and CERN_NET (137.138.0.0/17)
   </verbatim>
