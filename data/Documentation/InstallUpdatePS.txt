This page documents installing or upgrading *perfSONAR* for WLCG/OSG Sites.   Our goal is to support *all* WLCG/OSG sites in deploying, configuring and registering perfSONAR instances so we can gather network metrics about the network paths to other WLCG sites.   Information on motivations  and requirements  is  available  at  https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/IntegrationPS

For OSG/WLCG  installations  that  are  currently running  v3.3.x and were secured appropriately such that =Shellshock=  compromise  wasn't  a risk, please see  the  Upgrade section  below.

For  other  installations that  are running  older versions or  may have  been at risk for  being compromised,  we  are  suggesting  a clean (re)install (see  "Installing  perfSONAR" below).   *NOTE:*  A  clean (re)install will  lose all existing data on the  node.   If you want  to try to preserve the data  (not recommended) please see http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_update.html#migrating-from-a-3-3-2-livecd-liveusb for information on backing  up  and migrating your  data.   

---++ Installing perfSONAR

The  perfSONAR  team has  assembled  very nice  documentation  covering perfSONAR  at  http://docs.perfsonar.net/.    Specific  instructions  for  installing perfSONAR  are  available at  http://docs.perfsonar.net/install_getting.html.    We  are recommending  all  sites  use  the  "CentOS  6  Netinstall" option unless  they have requirements  that  would require  a different install.
