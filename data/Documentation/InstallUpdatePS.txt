This page documents installing or upgrading *perfSONAR* for WLCG/OSG Sites.   Our goal is to support *all* WLCG/OSG sites in deploying, configuring and registering perfSONAR instances so we can gather network metrics about the network paths to other WLCG sites.   Information on motivations  and requirements  is  available  at  https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/IntegrationPS
