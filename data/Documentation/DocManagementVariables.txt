---+++ What is _official_ OSG Documentation?

_All_ OSG Documentation is _official_ and should be edited with care. Some technical documents are read by OSG users and system administrators that require to be well written (_reviewed_) and checked for correctness (_tested_).

In comparison meeting notes as used by many webs are _not official_.
