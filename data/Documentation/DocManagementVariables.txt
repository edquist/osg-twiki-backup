---++++ Include the Document Status Table
   To include a table showing the document status at the top right of the page use following Twiki variable right after the HTML comment:
<pre class="file">
%%NOP%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
</pre>
%NOTE% The Document Status Table will be hidden whenever %%NOP%RELEASE_READY% = %%NOP%YES%.

---+++ Tracking documents for which you have some responsibility
There are a set of TWiki variables (command like) that will create tables on your home page (typically !Main.FirstLast) that will list documents for which you are the Owner, Reviewer, or Tester.  Variables also exist for Area owners of documentation.

---++++ How to set up your own Home Page
   =The Twiki Variables= developed as part of the Content Management Project are available for every user to set up their Home Pages in a way that suits them best.  Your home page is your TWiki user name, usually FirstLast, and can be viewed and edited by going to !Main.FirstLast.  Or go to the TWiki main page, and enter your TWiki name in the url in place of !WebHome.

   Document Tables can be generated for all documents you have a role in by including table queries placed in your home page.  The queries in the next sections pick up the OWNER variable from your home page. Include the following HTML comment at the beginning of your home page:
<pre class="file"><verbatim><!-- CONTENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT
   * Local OWNER = FirstLast
--></verbatim></pre>

---+++++ Create tables of documents that you are associated with
You can easily create tables of documents you own, commented on, tagged, review, and/or test as detailed in the following sections.

%TWISTY{start="hide"}%
%NOTE% The document table queries below will only work on your home page!

---+++++ Include a Table of Documents that I own
   To include a table of documents that you own:
<pre class="file">
%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

---+++++ Include a Table of Comments for my Documents
   You can search all documents you own for comments that you or other users left:

<pre class="file">
%%NOP%QUERY_USER_COMMENTS_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS_CLOSED%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_USER_COMMENTS%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

---+++++ Include a Table of Comments I made
   You can search all documents for comments that you made:

<pre class="file">
%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER_COMMENTS_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS_CLOSED%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER_COMMENTS%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

---+++++ Include a Table of Tags I made
   You can search all documents you tagged. A tag is a special form of Comment that you can use on every page that includes %%NOP%Comments%. The format of the comment has to be 'TAG_NAME = TAG_VALUE', such as 'QUALITY = HIGH':

<pre class="file">
%%NOP%TAG_TABLE_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS_CLOSED%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_OWNER_TAGS%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

%NOTE% A result will only be included once REVIEW_READY = %%NOP%YES% and only as long as RELEASE_READY = %%NOP%NO%

---+++++ Include a Table of Documents that I have been asked to Test
   Search all documents that have been assigned to you for test:

<pre class="file">
%%NOP%QUERY_TESTER_FORMAT%
%%NOP%TWISTY{%%NOP%TWISTY_OPTS_CLOSED%}%
%%NOP%SEARCH{%%NOP%QUERY_TESTER%}%
%%NOP%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>

%NOTE% A result will only be included once TEST_READY = %%NOP%YES% and only as long as RELEASE_READY = %%NOP%NO%

%ENDTWISTY%

---++++ Predefined Searches
Search for documents by Area, Roll, or Type.

| Many of these did not work for me -please see my home page.  %RED%In looking at your home page, it looks like Robert now has them fixed.  (I listed you as Tester since your home page serves as a good test with documents in multiple webs, etc.  I marked the test as failed until you confirm the tables work on your page.)%ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:57 |
| I think this is too much content to put in a twisty. Overall there is too much content on this DocHowTo page. %RED%I want this to be THE goto page for all people doing documentation.  I linked out to some of the content and collapsed some of the detail on tables, and removed the blue examples of all the searches.  So have a look now.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:59 |
