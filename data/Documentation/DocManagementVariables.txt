---++ Frequently asked Questions?

---+++ What is _official_ OSG Documentation?

_All_ OSG Documentation is _official_ and should be edited with care. Some technical documents are read by OSG users and system administrators that require to be well written (_reviewed_) and checked for correctness (_tested_). Those documents are managed by the [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocProcess][document process]] and are referred here as _official_.  For OSG Release 1.3, all documents in the [[Documentation/WebHome][Documentation Web]] and the [[Documentation/Release3/WebHome][Documentation/Release3 Web]] are _official_ and managed by the [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocProcess][document process]].   In comparison meeting notes as used by many webs are _not official_. 

%NOTE% For OSG Release 1.2.x and prior, all documents in the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][Release Documentation Web]] are _official_ and managed by the [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocProcess][document process]].
