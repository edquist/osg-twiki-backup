Is the "operations email" the same as the Support Center email? and also, please could the email be the second column in the report.


1. OSG TWiki header - backreference to the Mail OSG Web pages and document area..

can we consider making it more clear on the OSG Twiki header template that there IS an OSG Web Area and how to access information there? The OSG logo is a hot link to the OSG Web portal - but it is not obvious and if arbitrary web browsing people get to the TWiki through a good search on OSG - which I reckon is more likely at the moment than them getting to the Web Portal.

My request is that the OSG Twiki Header include

	OSG logo/hot link	OSG Web Site(link to openscienceigrid.org)
	Documentation (link to http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&elMenu=Documentation )
	Support (link to http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=29&elMenu=Grid%20Support) and
	OSG@WORK (http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&elMenu=OSG%20Grid)

2. OSG Web Portal links.

please check the changes in the dev area. here is my proposal for new names/sublink names. I assume these are easy/easier to change than my last request?
