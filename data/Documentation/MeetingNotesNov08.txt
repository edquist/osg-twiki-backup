<li>http://osg.grid.iu.edu/dev/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=83
Is the "operations email" the same as the Support Center email? and also, please could the email be the second column in the report.

<li>OSG TWiki header - backreference to the Mail OSG Web pages and document area..

	* can we consider making it more clear on the OSG Twiki header template that there IS an OSG Web Area and how to access information there? The OSG logo is a hot link to the OSG Web portal - but it is not obvious and if arbitrary web browsing people get to the TWiki through a good search on OSG - which I reckon is more likely at the moment than them getting to the Web Portal.

	* My request is that the OSG Twiki Header include

	OSG logo/hot link	OSG Web Site(link to openscienceigrid.org)<br>
	Documentation (link to http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=58&elMenu=Documentation )<br>
	Support (link to http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=29&elMenu=Grid%20Support)<br>
	OSG@WORK (http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&elMenu=OSG%20Grid)

<li> OSG Web Portal links.

	*please check the changes in the dev area. here is my proposal for new names/sublink names. I assume these are easy/easier to change than my last request?
