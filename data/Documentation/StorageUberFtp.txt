%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++About This Document
This document is intended for users who want to use "UberFTP" to either
   * list files at a storage location 
   * list directory structure at a storage location
   * get files from a storage location
   * put files in to a storage location
   * transfer files from one storage location to another

!UberFTP is an interactive !GridFTP enabled client. According to [[http://dims.ncsa.uiuc.edu/set/uberftp/index.html][official website]], it is the first interactive, !GridFTP enabled ftp client. It supports GSI authentication, parallel data channels and third party transfers.

---++Requirements
   * A valid grid proxy (if you want to use GSI authenticated session)
   * Permission to actually get/put/list the data
   * OSG Client, CE or WN software installed

---++Procedure
!UberFTP is packaged in to VDT as one of the [[Documentation.StorageGridFTP][GridFTP]]-enabled clients and should be available on any node that has OSG Client, CE or WN software installed.
To run the client, you need to 
   * login to proper node
   * For older Pacman installs, you will need to =source [VDT_LOCATION]/setup.sh=.  For RPM installs, this is no longer needed.
   * Make sure you have client in your [PATH] by running following command
<pre class="screen">
which uberftp
</pre>

---+++Usage

Note: Please refer to section "Screen dump of entire Procedure" for examples

---+++Normal Transfers
In normal data transfers, the "local" machine is the one on which you are running the command. 
   * Use =open= to select the remote host
   * Perform =put= and =get= between the local client machine and the remote FTP service

---+++Third-Party Transfers
Third-party transfers are performed similarly to other file transfers.In order to perform a third-party transfer:
   * Select a new "local" service by using =lopen=. Now all 'l*' commands perform actions on the new 'local' service as if you were logged into that machine
   * Use =put= to perform a third-party transfer when moving the file from "local" service to the "remote" service" 
   * Use =get= to perform a third-party transfer when moving the file from "remote" service to the "local" service"
   * Use =close= and =lclose= when you are finished with the "remote" and "local" service respectively

---+++GSI Authenticated Session
   * Obtain a grid proxy using =grid-proxy-init=
   * Use !UberFTP to access the remote server and run your commands
   * Close the connection
