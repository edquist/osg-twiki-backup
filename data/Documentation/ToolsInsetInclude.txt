%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

This topic is for including another topic but set the included text into a textbox. It allows us to send one set of parameters without having to rewrite the div.

---+++ To include a non-glossary topic in a box
Call this topic with _section="NonGlossary"_ defined. You may pass a regex pattern; however, you cannot pass certain things such as more than one space or a new line character.

<pre>
%<nop>INCLUDE{ "%WEB%.%TOPIC%" section="NonGlossary" INCLUDETOPIC="ItsWeb.TopicName" INCLUDESECTION="Section" INCLUDEPATTERN="SomeRegex" ParamOne="First Passed Parameter" ParamTwo="Second Passed Parameter" }%
</pre>

Example if you are trying to include the topic !AboutStorageAreaOsgApp in the Trash/ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050 subweb, which has no defined sections and needs no passed parameters:
<pre>
<nop>%<nop>INCLUDE{ "<nop>%WEB%.%TOPIC%" section="NonGlossary" INCLUDETOPIC="Integration.ITB_0_5.AboutStorageAreaOsgApp" }%
</pre>

---+++ To include a single glossary entry in a box
Call this topic with INCLUDETOPIC is "GlossaryX" (where "X" is the associated starting letter for your term) and _section="GlossaryTerm"_. 
<pre>
%<nop>INCLUDE{ "%WEB%.%TOPIC%" section="GlossaryTerm" INCLUDETOPIC="<nop>Documentation.GlossaryLETTER" TERM="Full Term With No Ending Space" }%
</pre>

Example to include the glossary entry for _Hiarchical Storage Manager_:
<pre>
%<nop>INCLUDE{ "<nop>%WEB%.%TOPIC%" section="GlossaryTerm" INCLUDETOPIC="<nop>Documentation.GlossaryH" TERM="Hiarchical Storage Manager" }%
</pre>


---+++ To include a single glossary entry with no box:
This just includes a glossary term. It's easier than trying to remember that whole regex pattern every time you use it.
<pre>
%<nop>INCLUDE{ "<nop>%WEB%.%TOPIC%" section="GlossaryTermNoBox" INCLUDETOPIC="<nop>Documentation.GlossaryH" TERM="Hiarchical Storage Manager" }%
</pre>


---+++ To put some text into a text box:
This method allows you to put any text into a text box. I've placed these variables in the Documentation.WebPreferences for this web. Hopefully, we'll get to the Main web soon.
<verbatim>
%STARTInsetBox%
Place some text that you want here.

You can even %INCLUDE{ "SomeTopic" }% other topics.

You can do anything that you want, as long as you close out all tags.
%ENDInsetBox%
</verbatim>

This renders like this:
%STARTInsetBox%
Place some text that you want here.

You can do anything that you want, as long as you close out all tags.
%ENDInsetBox%


---++ Sample and Usable Sections
   * Page variables when opened directly, rather than through an INCLUDE:
      * Set INCLUDETOPIC = GlossaryH
      * Set INCLUDEPATTERN =
      * Set TERM = Hierarchical Resource Manager
      * Set INCLUDESECTION = 
      * Set ParamOne = 
      * Set ParamTwo = 
      * Set INCLUDETEXT = This is some text to include. Use this method when you don't have access to WebPreferences to create the !STARTInsetBox and !ENDInsetBox variables.
   * INCLUDETOPIC = %INCLUDETOPIC%
   * INCLUDEPATTERN = %INCLUDEPATTERN%
   * INCLUDESECTION = %INCLUDESECTION%
   * ParamOne = %ParamOne%
   * ParamTwo = %ParamTwo%
