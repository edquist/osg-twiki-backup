---+!! Running a support center
%TOC%

---++ Purpose of Support Centers

Open Science Grid has implemented a distributed structure of support among the Virtual Organizations (VO), Resource Providers (RP), Grid Service and Technology Providers, and the OSG Grid Operations Center. Operational support of users and VO workload is the responsibility of the VOs, provided through designated Support Centers. Each support center helps an indentified set of VOs'  resource administrators.  Support Centers must be registered  as part of the OSG Operations.

---++ How to form a Support Center

A VO or a group of VOs will need to form a Support Center to act as operational support.  It is up to the VO(s) to organize this.
