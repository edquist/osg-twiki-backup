---++ Purpose of Support Centers

Open Science Grid has implemented a distributed structure of support among the Virtual Organizations (VO), Resource Providers (RP), Grid Service and Technology Providers, and the OSG Grid Operations Center. Operational support of users and VO workload is the responsibility of the VOs, provided through designated Support Centers. Each support center helps an indentified set of VOs'  resource administrators.  Support Centers must be registered  as part of the OSG Operations.

---++ How to form a Support Center

A VO or a group of VOs will need to form a Support Center to act as operational support.  It is up to the VO(s) to organize this.  You'll need to [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][register your Support Center with OSG]].  ([[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/RegistrationInstructions][Instructions]])

---++ What OSG expects from a Support Center

   * [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][Register your Support Center with OSG]]. 
   * Join the _osg-operations@opensciencegrid.org_ mailing list. ([[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Getting_Started/Consortium_Mailing_Lists][Instructions]])
   * Create an account on the [[https://tick.globalnoc.iu.edu/MRcgi/MRentrancePage.pl][Footprints OSG ticket system]].
   * Send a representative to the weekly operations telephone conference call %RED%I don't find day/time and number%ENDCOLOR%
   * Add information or links to [[VO/WebHome][VO specific information page]] to document your support-related policies and practices for your users
   * Respond to problem reports or problems identified by the Grid Operations Center and assigned to you for resolution.
   * Track your problems in the Footprints ticket system.

---++ How to interact with the VO(s) you support

 (from support page) When a user encounters a problem or has a question, the user should contact her VO Support Center or fall back to the Grid Operations Center.

   * This is the user end of it, but how does user know which to do?  
   * How does SC find out about user problems if they're not reported to the SC?  In other words, what are the proactive steps the SC should take with users?  
   * Can we ask SCs to fill in the VO/WebHome table cell(s) for their VO(s)?  Do we need to add a "support" column?
