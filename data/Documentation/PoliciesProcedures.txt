---++ OSG Policies and Procedures

OSG security policies are developed by OSG security team, when appropriate in conjunction with JSPG (see below).  A draft policy would first seek OSG Executive Board's approval, and then is sent to OSG Council for official endorsement. 

The compete list of OSG policies and agreement templates can be found below. Some policies are developed jointly with JSPG (indicated by the second column of the table), whereas some are developed solely by the OSG security team. A policy that is developed jointly with the JSPG states the common requirements across WLCG, EGEE and OSG. For each joint policy, OSG generates an OSG-specific document, which adheres to the JSPG policy, but also states additional OSG-specific requirements. A policy's status indicates its position at the approval process. Although some policies are identified to be necessary, they are still in their infancy, or work-in-progress (indicated by N/A in the table).

The latest versions of the documents are linked below. There are policies that are specific enough to OSG that they are not developed jointly, hence only listed as OSG documents.

---+++ JSPG

OSG participates in the Joint Security Policy Group ([[http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj%2Dlcg%2Dsecurity/][JSPG]]),  which aims to generate common security policies across WLCG, EGEE and OSG. The JSPG policies are often defined at a higher level that would state the common requirements among the grids. A JSPG policy is designed to be accompanied by a grid specific document. Each grid defines its own specifics to a JSPG policy.  A grid-based specification adheres to the JSPG policy, while it yields for the divergences among grids. WLCG, EGEE and OSG separately approves a JSPG working document before it becomes a JSPG policy. 

Mine Altunay is the OSG representative to JSPG. She works with WLCG and EGEE representatives to develop JSPG policies. An initial document is first approved by the OSG security team, and goes through several iterations. Then it is sent to OSG Executive Board and OSG Council for approval, after which it is officially adopted by OSG. Each JSPG policy has an associated OSG specific document. An OSG-specification is developed by OSG security team and is sent to OSG EB and Council for approval in the same fashion. The list of working documents of the JSPG are at http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj-lcg-security/documents.html.
