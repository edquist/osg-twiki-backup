[[ReleaseDocumentation.Bestman]]

---++ Introduction
 Berkeley Storage Manager ([[http://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman][Storage.BeStMan]]) is a full implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, for a disk based storage and mass storage systems such as HPSS. End users may have their own personal [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman][Storage.BeStMan]] that manages and gives an SRM interface to their own local disks. It works on top of existing disk-based unix file systems, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp. It requires minimal administrative efforts on the deployment and updates. If storage is hierarchical and/or spans multiple file system types and storage systems, [[ReleaseDocumentation.DCache][SRM/dCache]] should be considered.

---++ Introduction
%STARTINCLUDE%
 !Storage.BeStMan-Gateway, developed by the Scientific Data Management Group of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is a generic SRM v2.2 load balancing frontend for transfer servers. It works on top of existing disk-based POSIX-compliant file systems, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS2, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp.
%STOPINCLUDE%
This document is written for system administrators who are planning to use storage that is installed on top of a POSIX-compliant file system.  The goal of this document is to give enough information for system administrators to do initial simple configuration of the storage as well as provide references to the documents that may help to accomplish more sophisticated configuration. 

See also [[Storage.BeStMan][Storage.BeStMan Full mode]] for more information about !Storage.BeStMan full mode installation and  [[BestmanGatewayXrootd][BeStManGateway-Xrootd]] for more information about !BeStManGateway-Xrootd.




---++ Recommended Architecture 
!Storage.BeStMan-Gateway storage consists of the following components: 
   * !Storage.BeStMan-Gateway is an implementation of SRM v2.2 for essential interfaces to disk based storage systems - [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman][Storage.BeStMan Home Page]] 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp][GridFTP documentation]]
   * POSIX-compliant file system
   * optional package
      * Gratia gridftp transfer probe - cron job that reports all the file transfers to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector Gratia collector]]
      *  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS server]] - authentication and authorization service

!Storage.BeStMan-Gateway implements an essential subset of !SRM v2.2 specifications that includes: 
   *  !srmPing() 
   *  !srmGetTransferProtocols() 
   *  !srmLs()  
   *  !srmRm()  
   *  !srmMkdir()  
   *  !srmRmdir() 
   *  !srmPrepareToPut()  
   *  !srmPrepareToGet()  
   *  !srmPutDone()  
   *  !srmReleaseFiles()  
   *  !srmGetSpaceTokens() 
   *  !srmGetSpaceMetaData()

[[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGatewayXrootd]]

---++ Introduction

 !Storage.BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd  implements SRM v2.2 for generic posix file systems and provides storage that spans on multiple file systems. The installation of !Storage.BeStMan  in “full mode” on top of  the existing FS might be sufficient for small sites.

---++ Architecture 
 
!Storage.BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd storage consists of the following components: 
   *  FUSE -   [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net File System in User Space]] is required for !XrootdFS 
   * !XrootdFS -  is a Posix filesystem for an Xrootd storage cluster ([[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/xrootdfs.html XrootdFS Home Page]] ), is required for !Storage.BeStMan, !GridFTP to work with  Xrootd  
   * !Storage.BeStMan-gateway is a partial implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by LBNL, for disk based storage systems maintenance ( [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman Storage.BeStMan HomePage]] ) 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer ( [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp GrdiFTP Documentation]] ) 
   * Xrootd   provides POSIX-like access to files and their enclosing directory namespace ( [[http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/papers/Scalla-Intro.htm Xrootd Home Page]] )
