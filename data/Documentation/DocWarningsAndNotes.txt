---+!! Documentation Best Practices: Adding Warnings and Notes
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC%
---++
%STARTINCLUDE%
This describes how to put in a Note, Warning or Important comment that is set off from the regular text. The variables described below are defined in Documentation/DocumentationTeam.WebPreferences.

---++ Notes
Notes are asides about the contents of the text that provide specific information that particular, but not all, users may need. Notes are less necessary than *Importants* and unlike *Warnings*, may not cause harm if ignored.

   * Usage<br>
   To create a note, insert the =<nop>%NOTE<nop>%= variable, followed by a single space and your text:
   <verbatim>
   %NOTE% Here is my note text.
   </verbatim>
   * Example<br>
   %NOTE% Something that I want you to know about and pay some attention to.

<!-- ======BEGIN THE SECTION FOR INCLUDING ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Notes" }%
   $ %H% *%RED% NOTE %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Notes" }%
====== END SECTION ====== -->


---++ Importants
*Importants* are asides from your normal text that you want to highlight so that skimming users will not ignore them. Unlike Warnings, they will not cause grave harm to the system or the person if ignored. The difference between a *Note* and an *Important* is up to the writer.
   * Usage<br>
   Importants are included by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%IMPORTANT<nop>%= followed by a single space and your important text:
   <verbatim>
   %IMPORTANT% Some text about the important thing.
   </verbatim>
   * Example
   %IMPORTANT% Don't forget to include a single space or the *Important* will not work.

<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Importants"}%
   $ %X% *%GREEN% IMPORTANT %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Importants"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->

---++ Disclaimers
*Disclaimers* are asides from your normal text that you want to highlight so that users will not ignore them. Normally they limit the context of the document, its applicability. Unlike warnings, they will not cause grave harm to the system or person if ignored. The difference between a *Note* and an *Important* and a *Disclaimer* is up to the writer.

   * Usage<br>
   Disclaimers are included by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%DISCLAIMER<nop>%= followed by a single space and your disclaimer text:
   <verbatim>
   %DISCLAIMER% The content of the disclaimer.
   </verbatim>

   * Example
   %DISCLAIMER% This applies only to documents in this twiki.

<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Disclaimers"}%
   $ %H% *%RED% DISCLAIMER %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Disclaimers"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->

---++ Warnings
*Warnings* are set off from the regular flow of the text to especially warn the reader about an action that could cause harm to the system or to the user. It's less than something that should be labeled *DANGER* but more harmful than something that you would put into an *Important*. 

If something that you are instructing a user to do could take up the CPU for several minutes, you should put in a *Warning*.
   * Usage<br>
   Warnings are added by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%WARNING<nop>%= followed by a single space and your text.
   <verbatim>
   %WARNING% Some text here.
   </verbatim>
   * Example
   %WARNING% If ignore me, you'll regret it.
<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Warnings"}%
   $ %X% *%RED% WARNING! %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Warnings"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->
---++ Tips
Tips might be used to suggest an alternative that would be better under certain circumstances.
   * Usage<br>
   Tips are added by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%TIP<nop>%= followed by a single space and your text.
   <verbatim>
   %TIP% Some text here.
   </verbatim>
   * Example
   %TIP% It is really best if you do it this way.
<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Tips"}%
   $ %H% *%GREEN% TIP %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Tips"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->
