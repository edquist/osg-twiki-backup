---+!! Metadata Catalog
%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

The metadata catalog lets us store data about the data we are storing. It helps answers questions about what data exists. 

Note, though, that the MCS from Globus is still a research project and is only one realization of a metadata catalog. Other projects offer solutions with different capabilities and limitations.

There is very active research on what type of service a metadata catalog should offer. Many questions have to be answered: How should metadata information flow from site to site? Is there a single solution for most uses on the Grid?

---++ One scenario useful in a Data Grid
Imagine that some detector site generates data and collects them into files. The files' _location_ and TURL is published into RLS. But the _existence_ of the data files is published into the metadata catalog, along with important metadata about them. For example, it might have the following for file =H-R-714024224-16.gwf &#8594;=
   * Data from the detector in Hanford, WA.
   * The raw data file contains all data (no downsampling).
   * Data starts at GPS time 714024224.
   * The file contains 16 seconds of data.
   * The detector was in &#8220;science&#8221; mode with good noise properties.
   * A simulated pulsar signal was being injected at the time.
   * D. Brown was the operator on duty.
   * The calibration parameters are =&alpha; = 1.5643= and =&beta; = 2.22984=
   * ...

---++ To run an application that analyzes the data on the Grid
---+++ Query metadata catalog for LFNs that contain data of interest
   $ *%TEAL%Query%ENDCOLOR%*: &#8220;Show me files where interferometer was locked and calibration had &alpha; < 1.6 for GPS times from 714024240 to 714024340&#8221;
   $ *%OLIVE%Answer%ENDCOLOR%*:  H-R-714024224-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024240-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024256-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024272-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024288-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024304-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024320-16.gwf %BR% H-R-714024336-16.gwf

---+++ Querying RLI catalog to find out where those LFNs/files are known about
<pre class="screen">
$ <b>globus-rls-cli query rli lfn H-R-714024224-16.gwf rls://dataserver</b>
 H-R-714024224-16.gwf: rls://ldas-cit.ligo.caltech.edu:39281
</pre>

---+++ Querying LRC catalog to get URLs for those files of interest
<pre class="screen">
$ <b>globus-rls-cli query lrc lfn H-R-714024224-16.gwf: rls://ldas-cit.ligo.caltech.edu:39281 H-R-714024224-16.gwf: gsiftp://ldas-cit.ligo.caltech.edu:15000/archive/S1/L0/LHO/H-R-7140/H-R-714024224-16.gwf</b>
