   $ Access Anticipation Method<a name="DefsAccessAnticipationMethod"></a>: tries to foresee the I/O access characteristics of the application based on programmer&#8217;s hints, anticipated knowledge or reaction to identified behaviour. 

   $ Accounting (grid accounting): 	The OSG accounting system, called Gratia, tracks VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo members&#39; resource usage and presents that information in a consistent Grid-wide view, focusing in particular on CPU and Disk Storage utilization.

   $ ACDC Job monitoring: 				An application using grid submitted jobs to query the job managers and collect info about jobs. This info is stored in a DB and available for aggregated queries and browsing. ACDC Monitoring is now defunct.			

   $ Administrative Domain:			This refers to a set of personnel responsible for the maintenance of a given site who can answer questions, solve problems, and so on.

   $ Agent : A software component in OSG that operates on behalf of a User or Resource Owner or another Agent..

   $ Alliance: A collaboration of small application communities that develops systems and runs on the persistent grid infrastructure. <!--(changed) late apr -->

   $ Application: 				With respect to grid computing in general, &quot;application&quot; refers to a &quot;layer&quot; of grid components (above infrastructure and resources). <!--(new from Ruth) late apr -->An application  is a name used to identify  a set of software that will execute computational jobs, manage data (access, store, read...) and has many attributes. Any application when invoked (executed) includes information that allows tracing back to the individual who is responsible for the execution. 

   $ Application administrator: 				A person designated by a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo who is charged with making sure that a particular application works on the participating grid resources. 				

   $ Application community:				Providers of a particular end-to-end application and/or system that runs on the persistent grid infrastructure. Smaller application communities may collaborate as Alliances in developing systems and running them on the grid. These organizations will contribute by providing application requirements and interfaces to the grid services. An application community may consist of or span multiple VOs or VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo groups <!--(change per Alain/Ruth) mid apr -->.				

   $ Application layer<a name="DefsApplicationLayer"></a>: Final of five layers to support grid applications. Includes all application-specific services, including Request Interpretation and part of Request Management]].

   $ Application Level Method<a name="DefsApplicationLevelMethod"></a>: organizes the mappings of the application&#8217;s main memory objects to respective disk objects to make disk accesses more efficient by exploiting data locality. 
   $ Application middleware:			<!--(new from Ruth) mid apr -->     Application Middleware is application-specific middleware which has some embedded capabilities and interfaces that are not general, e.g., information providers and configuration of MDS.&nbsp; This middleware depends on grid-wide middleware. 			

   $ ARDA:		Architectural Roadmap towards Distributed Analysis (ARDA) is a project within LCG that seeks to coordinate the prototyping of distributed analysis systems for the LHC experiments. (<a href="http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/activities/arda/arda.html">http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/activities/arda/arda.html</a>)           					
   $ Auditing (grid auditing):				Grid auditing in OSG relates to resolving claims of challenged authentication and exposed risk on grid services which accept delegated credentials. The auditing system will use information from the accounting system and link it to information from other sources to allow full tracking and analysis of the actions and events related to a user&#39;s resource usage.			

   $ AUP: 					Acceptable Use Policy

<!-- from Forrest and enstore manual
   $ Atlas: 					A Toroidal LHC !ApparatuS experiment at the LHC at CERN (<a href="http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/Welcome.html">http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/Welcome.html</a>) <br /> 					

   $ active file<a name="DefsActiveFile"></a>: Any file currently in Enstore. 
   $ accounting server<a name="DefsAccountingServer"></a>: Enstore&#8217;s interface to a database of transfer-related data that maintains statistical information on a running system.

   $ alarm server (AS)<a name="DefsAlarmServer"></a>: Maintains a record of alarms raised by other servers, and creates reports available online. 
   $ AS: _See_ [[#DefsAlarmServer][alarm server]].
   $ authZ: Short for Authorization.
   $ authN: Short for Authentication.
