   $ VDT<a name="DefsVdt"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsVirtualDataToolkit][Virutal Data Toolkit]].
   $ Virtual Data: The concept that data can be stored as the information about how it can be reproduced.

   $ Virutal Data Toolkit<a name="DefsVirtualDataToolkit"></a>: the ensemble of grid middleware upon which the OSG software stack is based, and that can be easily installed and configured.   _See also_ [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/index.html][VDT site]].

   $ Virtual Organization<a name="DefsVirtualOrganization"></a>: (VO) A dynamic collection of Users, Resources and Services for sharing of Resources (Globus definition). A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is party to contracts between Resource Providers & VOs which govern resource usage & policies. A subVO is a sub-set of the Users and Services within a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo which operates under the contracts of the parent. (previous definition) A participating organization in a grid to which grid end users must be registered and authenticated in order to gain access to the grid's resources. A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo must establish resource-usage agreements with grid resource providers. Members of a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo may come from many different home institutions, may have in common only a general interest or goal (e.g., CMS physics analysis), and may communicate and coordinate their work solely through information technology (hence the term virtual). An organization like an HEP experiment can be regarded as one VO.
   $ Virtual Site: A set of sites that agree to use the same policies in order to act as an administrative unit. Sites and Facilities negotiate a common administrative context to form a "virtual" site or facility.
   $ Volatile file: A file that is temporary in nature, but has a (pin) lifetime guarantee.
   $ Volatile storage: Storage in which the "volatile" physical replica of a file is subject to removal from the SRM or DRM according to preset policies.
   $ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS: The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Management Registration Service (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS) is a server that provides the means for registerin members of a Virtual Organization, and coordination of this process among the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and grid resource administrators. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS consists of a database to maintain user registration and institutional information, and a web user interface (web UI) for input of data into the database and manipulation of that data. See http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/.
   $ Virtual Organization Membership System (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS)<a name="DefsVirtualOrganizationManagementSystem"></a>: a system that manages real-time user authorization information for a VO. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is designed to maintain only general information regarding the relationship of the user with his VO, e.g., groups he belongs to, certificate-related information, and capabilities he should present to resource providers for special processing needs. It maintains no personal identifying information besides the certificate.
   $ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo<a name="DefsVo"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsVirtualOrganization][Virtual Organization]].
