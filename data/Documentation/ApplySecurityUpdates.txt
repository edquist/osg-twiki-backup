---++ Apply security updates of VDT/OSG software
There are frequent updates to the grid software for security and functional improvements,
just like any other software.  The update will tell you how severe the patch is and how quickly you should apply it. We very highly recommend following the update. It is ultimately your decision as the site admin when to apply a patch but anything
longer than a few days delay should have a good reason.
One example notice of an update message is:

The notice above is for a security update to the Glexec software and should be considered urgent
for sites running Glexec. If a site is not running Glexec then it is not urgent. 
If you are not sure if you run a specific component or not, there are a few things you can do. Use vdt-control --list command. This will give you a list of running grid services. Or Go to [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html][VDT Documentation]] web site to find out which components are included in a particular version.  

Another example notice is shown below, which is a more general software update
but includes a security update for Java.  Most sites use Java in one form or another
and so it should be considered important for all sites but since it was not identified
specifically as a Security Update it is not critical for security purposes. However, it may be critical for proper functioning of your services .
