---++ Storage Documents in Release Documentation
This is a list of storage related documents in ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome with some observations based on a quick skim of each document.

   1 ReleaseDocumentation.GuideToStorageElements: Created but not written - Note: the ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway page has an architecture page that could be part of this.  This page isn't easy to find!  Also the ReleaseDocumentation.InstallationITBStorageElement is a useful summary of the full SE installation.  It also contains test suites that don't appear to be available for production installs?
   1 [[ReleaseDocumentation.DCache][DCache]]:  Has broken links.  Doesn't explain all acronyms (PNFS)  %RED%Fixed links, added more information, more work is required - Tanya%ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.GratiaDcacheProbes: Looks reasonable - format close to new format.  Several typos
   1 [[ReleaseDocumentation.Bestman][Bestman]]: SRM client testing looks long -  Need testing scripts?  Two sections later, a simple set of client tests are provided.  Several typos  %RED% I think the link to srm lbnl-client testing is fine. I would propose to replace "Sample client runs" section with simple sanity check command  (srm-ping, srm-copy) - Tanya%ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanOnCE: No longer a bestman System_sanity_check anchor in !BestmanGateway so link fails %RED% I think sanity check should be restored, if you disagree I would add it here - Tanya %ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway: Should the architecture page be in common to other docs?  It references GridFTP docs from Globus - should this now be a reference to gsiFTP install? %RED%I am not sure, because !BeStManXrootd and !BeStManHDFS have some additional components. Please, decide what to use GridFTP or GsiFTP and I will change it - Tanya %ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGatewayXrootd: Architecture info is good.  Some typos
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.GsiFtpStandAlone: Will this now be changed (shortened) since a new script is available? Creating osg-user-vo-map (is this required/recommended or what?).  The OSG Gratia page doesn't seem to work.
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.GratiaTransferProbe: What is the status of this document? %RED%I think it is in good condition but will need to change based on template and new osg config.ini - Tanya%ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.DCacheFAQs: Looks like useful info%RED%Should be moved from ReleaseDocumentation to StorageForum - Tanya%ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.GratiadCacheProbes: Just started with an Overview section %RED%Delete - replaced by item 2.%ENDCOLOR%

The following are not linked to primary document list on the ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome page:
   1 Documentation.AboutStorageElements: Useful?  Should be part of Guide?  %RED%Useful introduction to Storage in OSG Guide - Tanya%ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.LocalStorageConfiguration:  Looks great but need to see how referenced%RED%It is not related to "storage" installation, it is  to how access local storage from worker node" - Tanya%ENDCOLOR%
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.ConfigurationFileStorage:  Looks great but need to see how referenced
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.StorageElementAdmins:  Setting up and testing storage elements 
   1 [[Documentation.SETools,Tips,FAQs]]: Out of date - still useful?
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.ValidateDcacheGratia:  Just a few links elsewhere
   1 ReleaseDocumentation.XrootdStandAlone: Under development?
