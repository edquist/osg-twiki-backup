We'd like to provide multiple access paths to the same documents. The main one is the !SysAdmin view main path. The _Additional navigation_ provides links to the blocks or subtrees of the !SysAdmin view main path. "* ..." is used sometime instead of repeating the same subitems of a branch.
This is purely a navigation page. Relevant existing documents will have to be identified, assigned in the "buckets" of the sysadmin view main path and will automatically be in the alternate paths. The elements in the alternate view are references to a leaf or a subtree of the sysadmin view main path.
Each leaf is a pointer to a set of (one or more) documents.
A tree like structure would be ideal for this navigation structure.

Some comments:
   * There is little or no documentation about central services. The links in the navigation should be considered placeholders, not trigger a big documentation effort. If there is no documentation, explain how to get the information, e.g. "Send an email to Rob Quick".
   * Organization "by activity" or "by item" is a matter of personal preference. Current documents are more "by document" oriented.
