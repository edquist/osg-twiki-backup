---+ Agenda

---++ Change in Project Lead

   * Robert leaves OSG on Friday 09/30/2011
   * Jim will become new project lead on Monday 10/03/2011

---++ Document Migration

   * from !ReleaseDocumentation to Documentation/Release3
   * Note that there are few documents in [[Documentation/Release3.WebTopicList][Release3.WebTopicList]] so there are no overlapping names
   * Some documents shouldn't be moved:
      * All whose name contains .*OSG1.* (Release notes from prior releases)
      * All whose name begins with Pacman.*  (or maybe not since there are still a few packages installed with Pacman)
      * All whose name contains .*Comments.* (Used for capturing ITB testing results for OSG 1.0 and 1.2)
      * All whose name contains .*Release.* (Mostly release notes or info on packages in prior releases)
      * All whose name begins with Nav.*  (Navigation pages are already in Release3)
      * All whose name contains .*Validation.* (Validation of previous releases)
      * All whose name contains .*Vomrs.* (Not provided in Release3)
      * !ActionItemsGC2010
      * !ReviewStatus
   * What about the parent directory/documents?
   * Thoughts from Alain
      1 Tell everyone not to edit the documentation for a few hours.
      1 Move all the documentation to the Release3 web. Make sure to have an "index" file similar to Documentation.RPMTempDocuments
      1 Trim Documentation.RPMTempDocuments so it points at the new index file.
      1 Tell everyone they can edit again.
