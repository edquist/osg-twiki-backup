---++ Last Week's Agenda/Meeting Notes

---++++1. Review/Discussion of ReleaseDocumentation.DocInstallTemplate
Any additional improvements before we send it for a wider review?
   1. The sections headings do not stand out enough - Actually all the heading level formats need to be improved to indicate the true hierarchy with level 2 heading more prominent than level 3, etc.
   1. The notes are too prominent - Yes, these should be less prominent and appropriately fit in with the headings.
   1. For longer documents, a back button should be put in each section for returning to the Table of Contents

---++++2. Review/Discussion of application of these for ReleaseDocumentation.GsiFtpStandAlone
Review document - Any areas that need improvement?
   1. Split Service Startup and Validation into 2 sections as they are in the template
   1. Engineering - use the numerical info Brian has for determining how many ftp servers are required.

---++++3. Standard help procedure
   * Example: VDT has a script that packages up various log files that is needed for resolving problems
   * Standard process should be to open a trouble ticket with the GOC but most admins send out email to get a quicker response

---++++4. Next steps
   1. Robert/Jim to draft a document on owner responsibilities
   1. Robert/Jim to draft a process for planning, creating, reviewing, and evaluating documentation
   1. Meeting with Gardner and Trash/Integration team on above next week
   1. Iwona will get Tanya's comments into install document
   1. Anyone can put suggestions directly into gsiftp document or email change to Iwona
