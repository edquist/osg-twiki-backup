---+ An introduction to OSG for end users

This page is aimed at beginning users who want to use the resources on the OSG.  Every user must be associated with a registered organization (called a VO).  Many large VOs (such as ATLAS and CMS) already have extensive user documentation; these pages are primarily oriented at users of smaller VOs who might be porting their own or community applications to the OSG.

These pages first introduce the primary OSG concepts, then dives into the nuts and bolts of building (or porting) an application to the grid by showing demonstration applications of increasing complexity.  Both job management and data management are covered. 

---++ Open Science Grid
   * What is OSG?  This page introduces the "big-picture" concepts of *what the OSG is, what it is not,* and what it tries to achieve.
   * What are VOs?  Virtual Organizations - "VOs" - are an important organizational concept for the OSG; this page *introduces VOs for the end-user*.

---++ Security
   * [[Documentation/CertificateWhatIs][What is a certificate?]]  A digital certificate is like a passport for the grid.  This page introduces them to new users, and includes links for getting your own certificate.
   * How do you get access to a site?  The certificate provides you with an identity - but doesn't give you access rights to a site!  This page describes *how one gets authorized at an OSG site*.

---++ Using the OSG
---+++ Running Jobs
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/ValidateClients][Running basic jobs]]  (Note that the linked-to page needs work. For instance, it doesn't talk about how globus-job-run is bad for anything but testing.<br>[[Documentation/UseResourcesProperly][An alternative page with similar information]] We should merge these two documents, probably.
   * [[Documentation/FindAvailableResource][Finding OSG sites to run your jobs]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/EnvironmentVariables][The OSG job environment]] (where is OSG_DATA? What's in the environment?)
   * Using the OSG Matchmaker to run jobs (Want new page with a nice introduction, not just user guide from below)<br>[[http://osgmm.sourceforge.net/ar01s03.html][OSG Matchmaker User Guide]]
   * [[Documentation/GoldenRulesForPowerUsers][Best practices for running lots of jobs]] _Needs updating_


---+++ Data management
   * [[Storage/WebHome#Storage_for_the_End_User][Overview of data management approaches]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/LocalStorageConfiguration][Finding unmanaged storage at sites]] Note that the linked-to document is targeted at sysadmins, not clients. We might need a separate document.
   * The basics (Getting stuff into OSG_APP, OSG_DATA)  _Doesn't exist yet?_
   * Best practices _Doesn't exist yet?_
   * [[Storage/StorageEndUser][Client tools used for data transfer and storage]]

---++ Policies and guidelines
   * [[Documentation/AboutResourceAllocation][About resource allocation]] <!--from gridusersguide-->
   * [[Documentation/UseResourcesProperly][Using resources properly]]

---++ Advanced Usage
   * [[Documentation/GoldenRulesForPowerUsers][Useful tips for users]]
   * Does your VO run pilot jobs? [[ReleaseDocumentation/ValidateGlexecAtSite][Check if a site is running gLexec]].
