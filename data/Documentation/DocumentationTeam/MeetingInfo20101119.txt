---++ Agenda

   * status reports for document areas
      * Compute Element ( Suchandra )
      * Integration ( Suchandra )
      * Storage ( Ted, Tanya )
      * User Documentation ( Brian )
      * Tier3 ( Marco )
         *  Tier3.Tier3Help modified and follow up with reviewer
         *  Tier3.XrootdClient follow up with reviewer and tester
         *  edited ReleaseDocumentation.WorkerNodeClient, email to Tanya and Alain about CA/Condor special requirements, waiting reply to email Steve Tim, needs a new tester (was Iwona)
         * (cont the above) improved ReleaseDocumentation.CaCertificatesInstall after email exchange with Steve Tim and Alain about the configuration of legacy software (indirectly affects ReleaseDocumentation.WorkerNodeClient - ready to be released)
         * Trash.Tier3DocBestPracticesWarningsAndNotes touch base with RobertEngel that is supposed to incorporate it in the main Trash.Tier3DocBestPracticesWarningsAndNotes document. At the end I did the changes myself. Coordinated with Jim Weichel. Asked Kyle to fix the ReleaseDocumentation.WebPreferences (that are referring to the Integration version of the document). Notified Suchandra to remove the version in Integration.
      * Security ( James )
         * Three more documents were released this week.  This leaves two documents left for review.  The two documents are in relation to grid certificates and we are looking to see if we should just merge the information into other existing documents.  Many of the documents have now gone through testing.  There are the above 2 docs left for review and 2 docs left for testing.  Anand should be able to get the testing done first thing next week.
         * I made changes to the [[ReleaseDocumentation/HelpProcedure][Help Procedure]] document for pointers to the Incident handling procedures.
      * Operations ( Elizabeth )
      * VO ( Terrence Martin )
