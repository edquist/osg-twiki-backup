---++Notes
   * Rename REQUEST_ to INCLUDE_
   * Define "funny" states that "shouldn't" happen.  Like INCLUDE_REVIEW true and REVIEW_PASSED false and RELEASE_READY true
   * When a document is released, "all" comments should be cleared by owner.
   * It would be nice if new comments on a page notify owner.
