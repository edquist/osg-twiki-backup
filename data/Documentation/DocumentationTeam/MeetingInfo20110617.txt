---+ Our Condor Installation

<div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; border: 1px solid black; padding: 0.5em;">
---+++ Objective of this exercise

This exercise should help you understand the basics of how Condor is installed, what Condor processes (a.k.a. daemons) are running, and what they do.
</div>

---++ vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu
Before you start, make sure you are logged into =vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu=. You should have been given your name and password when you arrived at the school. If you don't know them, talk to Alain.

---++ Looking at our Condor installation

How do you know what version of Condor you are using? Try =condor_version=: 

<pre style="margin-left:4em" class="screen">
% condor_version
$CondorVersion: 7.6.1 May 31 2011 BuildID: 339001 $
$CondorPlatform: x86_rhap_5 $
</pre>

You might be surprised that it reports _RedHat Enterprise Linux 5_ instead of _Scientific Linux SL release 5.4_ (the version of Linux installed on =vdt-itb.cs.wisc.edu=). It is reporting the operating system that it was compiled on, not the operating system that is in use. Don't worry, the !RedHat Enterprise Linux binaries work just fine on Scientific Linux.

*Extra Tip: The OS version*

}%
Do you know how to find the OS version? You can usually look in /etc/issue to find out:

<pre style="margin-left:2em" class="screen">
% cat /etc/issue
Scientific Linux SL release 5.4 (Boron)
Kernel \r on an \m
</pre>

Or you can run:
<pre style="margin-left:2em" class="screen">
% lsb_release -a
LSB Version:	:core-3.1-amd64:core-3.1-ia32:core-3.1-noarch:graphics-3.1-amd64:graphics-3.1-ia32:graphics-3.1-noarch
Distributor ID:	ScientificSL
