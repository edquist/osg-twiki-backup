---++ Agenda
---++++1. Status of  ReleaseDocumentation.GsiFtpStandAlone
Waiting update for new install scripts?

---++++2. Storage System Documentation
   * Tanya and Jim have drawn and/or discussed a logical, organizational, and physical view of the storage subsystem to identify what documentation needs to be added/changed.
   * The organizational view suggests we should focus specific documentation for:
      * Small VO (i.e. University)
      * CMS T3
      * ATLAS T3
   * Jim did a skimming review of current storage documents in ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome.  Here are some comments:
      * ReleaseDocumentation.GuideToStorageElements: Created but not written - Note: the ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway page has an architecture page that could be part of this.  This page isn't easy to find!  Also the ReleaseDocumentation.InstallationITBStorageElement is a useful summary of the full SE installation.  It also contains test suites that don't appear to be available for production installs?
      * [[ReleaseDocumentation.DCache][DCache]]:  Has broken links.  Doesn't explain all acronyms (PNFS)
      * ReleaseDocumentation.GratiaDcacheProbes: Looks reasonable - format close to new format.  Several typos
      * [[ReleaseDocumentation.Bestman][Bestman]]: SRM client testing looks long -  Need testing scripts?  Two sections later, a simple set of client tests are provided.  Several typos
      * ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanOnCE: No longer a bestman sanity check in BestmanGateway
      * ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway: Should the architecture page be in common to other docs?  It references GridFTP docs from Globus - should this now be a reference to gsiFTP install?
      * ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGatewayXrootd: Architecture info is good.  Some typos
      * ReleaseDocumentation.GsiFtpStandAlone: Will this now be changed (shortened) since a new script is available? Creating osg-user-vo-map (is this required/recommended or what?).  The OSG Gratia page doesn't seem to work.
      * ReleaseDocumentation.GratiaTransferProbe: What is the status of this document?
      * [[Documentation.SETools,Tips,FAQs]]: Out of date - still useful?
      * Documentation.AboutStorageElements: Useful?  Should be part of Guide?
      * ReleaseDocumentation.LocalStorageConfiguration:  Looks great but need to see how referenced
      * ReleaseDocumentation.ConfigurationFileStorage:  Looks great but need to see how referenced
   * Jim also looked at the current storage documents within the storage team area.  (Hadoop documents are being created there now.)  Observatiions:
      * [[Storage.StorageInOSGDraft]]: Any useful info for the Guide document here?
