---++ Agenda/%BLUE%Notes%ENDCOLOR%
---++++1. Status of  ReleaseDocumentation.GsiFtpStandAlone
Waiting update for new install scripts?

---++++2. Storage System Documentation
   * Tanya and Jim have drawn and/or discussed a logical, organizational, and physical view of the storage subsystem to identify what documentation needs to be added/changed.
   * The organizational view suggests we should focus specific documentation for:
      * Small VO (i.e. University)
      * CMS T3
      * ATLAS T3
   * Discussion of current storage documents in ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome.   See StorageDocReview.
   * Discussion of the current storage documents within the storage team area.  (Hadoop documents are being created there now.)  See StorageDocReview#StorageTeam
