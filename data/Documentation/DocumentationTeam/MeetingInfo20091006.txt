---++ Last Week's Agenda/Meeting Notes
---++++1. Review/Discussion of InstallDocContentRequirements
This looks good.  Like the fact it is short.  We might want to reorder the needs in some priority order.  It will be more comprehensible to writers after we have some documents in the new format.

---++++2. Review/Discussion of InstallDocContent
%NOTE% The sections with blue font are ones we need to discuss.
   1. Put Software version and Engineering Considerations as subsections of the introductions - make them stand out but take less space.

   1. Change File Locations to Debugging and put in info to help users debug a problem (things to check, log files to review, etc.)
