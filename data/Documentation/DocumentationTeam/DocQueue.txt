---++ Read Me First!

The purpose of this page is to provide a queue of documents to editors, reviewers and testers to pick. The individual document tables will be populated by the listed area coordinators.

---+++ Who may choose a document?

Anyone who wishes to volunteer to work on a document in his or her area of competence. The Documentation Team has a large number of documents that each need to be reviewed and tested before release and will be very grateful to every volunteer who contributes to the project!

---+++ How much time is this going to take?

The most time consuming task is to write a new document or rewrite an existing document. Writing is a creative process and as such is difficult, time consuming, but also fun! You should plan one full day of work for each document that you write.

To review a document takes less time. It requires you to read carefully through a document evaluating the overall structure and presentation of content. It may take an hour of work to extensively review an average document.

To test a document might take the least time. It requires you to test the procedures presented in the document. This may take a few minutes up to a day depending on the complexity of the task.

---+++ How to choose a document?

Choose an area that you are most knowledgeable about or interested in from the list below. You may either choose a document right from the table below by filling in your name and the current date. Alternatively you may check the document status table for each area to find a document that needs to be edited, tested or reviewed. In the later case simply add the document you have chosen to the document queue on this page.

---+++ I chose a document, now what?

Unfortunately a bit of bureaucracy is involved at this point. In order to coordinate the work between the documentation team and all volunteers we have created a %RED%Document Process%ENDCOLOR%. Please make sure to read the documentation for document [[ReleaseDocumentation.DocForOwners][owners]], [[ReleaseDocumentation.DocForReviewers][reviewers]] and [[ReleaseDocumentation.DocForTesters][testers]] before you proceed. These documents provide an overview of the document process and are in fact %RED%short to read%ENDCOLOR%.

 Next, proceed directly to the document. In the upper right corner a status table for the document will be displayed. The status table shows if the document requires a review or a test.

---+++ I am done, now what?

Thank you for your effort! You may have noticed the HTML comment inside the document. Please fill in required information in the document owner, tester or reviewer section.

---+++ How can I get help?

The documentation team maintains the <a href="mailto:osg-docs@opensciencegrid.org">osg-docs</a> mailing list. Alternatively you may e-mail the listed area coordinators for any questions you have.
