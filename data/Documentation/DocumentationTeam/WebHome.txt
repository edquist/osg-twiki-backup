---++ Description
The Documentation Team is a group of OSG members who are working to improve the documentation provided by OSG.
These improvements are based on a study conduced by Jim Weichel and a follow-on 2 day workshop with the [[#TeamMembers][Documentation Team]] (that iincluded Ann Zimmerman as facilitator).  Both are documented in the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=861][Documentation Alignment Initiative]],
The improvements are to be implemented during OSG Year 4 (1 Oct 2009 - 30 Sep 2009).

---++ Strategy
This effort is part of the OSG Area 1.8 Training and Content Management.
“Content Management” captures the strategy (and practical fact) that nearly all the content of OSG documentation and training must be produced by the providers of the software and processes, both in the OSG Consortium and external to OSG.  Therefore, the Training and Content Management area is responsible for providing a good framework of processes, technology, and standards to encourage and enable the content providers provide that content.

---++ Goals
*Content Management*
   1. Establish ownership, policies, and processes for documentation
   1. Implement standards and technology to support documentation processes
      A. Annotation
      A. Document rating
      A. Document standards with associated templates
*Documentation*
   1. Provide package of documentation (Quick Guides) for T3 sites. This includes site creation, site administration, and site security.  (Dan Fraser/Marco Mambelli lead providers of content.  Mine Altunay provides security content – see also 5 below.)
   1. Provide improved release, security, and storage documentation that meets the new standards.  (Rob Gardner & team lead owners to provide content in next release.  Mine Altunay provides content for security.)
   1. Provide Security Guides that double as training material (Mine Altunay provides content)
   1. Better organize and enhance documentation that we have for End Users
   1. Consolidate information to address the many issues that have to be worked (technical and political) to add a Campus to OSG.   (Sebastien Goasguen leads development of content.)
