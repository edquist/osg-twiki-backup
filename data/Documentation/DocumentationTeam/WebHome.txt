---++ Description
The Documentation Team is a group of OSG members who are working to improve the documentation provided by OSG.
These improvements are based on a study conduced by Jim Weichel and a follow-on 2 day workshop with the [[#TeamMembers][Documentation Team]] (that included Ann Zimmerman as facilitator).  Both are documented in the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=861][Documentation Alignment Initiative]],
The improvements are to be implemented during OSG Year 4 (1 Oct 2009 - 30 Sep 2010).

---++ Strategy
This effort is part of the OSG Area 1.8 Training and Content Management.
“Content Management” captures the strategy (and practical fact) that nearly all the content of OSG documentation and training must be produced by the providers of the software and processes, both in the OSG Consortium and external to OSG.  Therefore, the Training and Content Management area is responsible for providing a good framework of processes, technology, and standards to encourage and enable the content providers provide that content.

---++ Goals
*Content Management*
   1. Establish ownership, policies, and processes for documentation
   1. Implement standards and technology to support documentation processes
      A. Annotation
      A. Document rating
      A. Document standards with associated templates
*Documentation*
   1. Provide package of documentation (Quick Guides) for T3 sites. This includes site creation, site administration, and site security.  (Dan Fraser/Marco Mambelli lead providers of content.  Mine Altunay provides security content – see also 5 below.)
   1. Provide improved release, security, and storage documentation that meets the new standards.  (Rob Gardner & team lead owners to provide content in next release.  Mine Altunay provides content for security.)
   1. Provide Security Guides that double as training material (Mine Altunay provides content)
   1. Better organize and enhance documentation that we have for End Users
   1. Consolidate information to address the many issues that have to be worked (technical and political) to add a Campus to OSG.   (Sebastien Goasguen leads development of content.)

---++ Work in Progress

Each of the documents in this section have a comment field that you can use to give us input or you can send mail to:  [[mailto:OSG-DOCS@listserv.fnal.gov][OSG-DOCS]].

We are experimenting with an initial proposal for the contents of an installation document.  The user needs and requirements for Installation Documents are found in InstallDocContentRequirements and the resulting Install Document template is ReleaseDocumentation.DocInstallTemplate.   The first install document created using the template is ReleaseDocumentation.GsiFtpStandAlone.

We are developing short descriptions of the Documentation processes (ReleaseDocumentation.DocProcess) and the responsibilities of the roles in documentation:
   * ReleaseDocumentation.DocOwnerResponsibilities
   * ReleaseDocumentation.DocReviewerResponsibilities
   * ReleaseDocumentation.DocTesterResponsibilities
One important issue in the process is how to manage documentation for new releases.  See ReleaseDocumentation.DocReleaseProcess for the new process for managing documentation for different types of releases.

*Training for anyone working on documentation can be found in ReleaseDocumentation.DocHowTo.* 

We are looking at TWiki plugins and other technologies to add the features needed for the Alignment Project.  TechnologyUsed lists the features and proposed technologies.
There is a new TWiki set up to test these technologies at [[https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Main/WebHome][Test TWiki]].  The [[https://twiki-itb.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/DocumentationTeam/PluginGallery][PluginGallery]] is a test of these plugins on the test !TWiki.

A list of work items for the project are in WorkItems.

---+++ Action Items

   * [[ActionItemsCE][Compute Element]]

---+++Document Triage
We did a triage of all the documents in the Documentation.WebHome and ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome webs.  The results of this review can be found in DocTriageAll.  In addition, a triage document was created for each area owner that lists documents in their area that are in the Documentation.WebHome and ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome webs as well as other webs (like the associated team web).  This is explained in DocTriage which contains a table listing the individual triage documents for each area.

The documents in the Documentation.WebHome and ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome webs that currently have Owners (RESPONSIBLE variable) can be found in DocLists which list both the Owner and Reviewer.

Also a list documents in various team webs is contained in DocTriageTeam.
