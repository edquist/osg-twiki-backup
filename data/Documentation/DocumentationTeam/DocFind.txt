%COMMENT%
   * The &#34;Find Documents that Include the Document in the Search Box&#34; search doesn&#39;t find all documents that include the specified document.  Example: Search for ReleaseDocumentation.CaCertificatesInstall returns only 2 documents (ReleaseDocumentation.CaCertificatesUpdates and ReleaseDocumentation.InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS) yet other documents do INCLUDE it -- ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationGuide is one but there are many others.  This may be because ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationGuide includes only a specified section of ReleaseDocumentation.CaCertificatesInstall. -- Main.JamesWeichel - 17 Jun 2011 - 20:14
   * I don&#39;t understand what Project Documents are so that needs a definition. Also, if I uncheck the box, and do a search, the result is returned with the box checked so the user doesn't know if he is looking at the results Limited or not Limited. -- Main.JamesWeichel - 17 Jun 2011 - 18:43
   * Once any search is complete, you lose all record of what was searched.  The drop down that was activated for the search could be left on the selected search or a line could be displayed at the top of the search results that states the search the results represent. -- Main.JamesWeichel - 17 Jun 2011 - 18:41
