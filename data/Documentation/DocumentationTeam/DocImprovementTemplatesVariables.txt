---+ Workshop Templates and Variables
Standards, Templates, Formatting, Variables Presentation for the Document Improvement Workshop.
%SLIDESHOWSTART%
---++ Introduction
   * All information for people doing documentation is in ReleaseDocumentation.DocHowTo
   * This will cover the Document Formatting Section
   * We liberally used existing guidelines

---++ Rules for topics
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+ *<nop>Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!  If you want to spell out a title whose TWiki name has abbreviations, do that.
   * All level two sections should be in title case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the Installation=
   * All sections (level three and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---+++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * Exclude from the TOC all sections level three and below (=---+++=, =---++++=, etc.).  To accomplish this,  use !%TOC{depth="2"}% to produce the table of contents.

---++ Composite Documents and Templates
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.DocExampleMainTopic]] for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/DocFormattingRules#Compose_Documents_using_Includes][About Includes and  Composite Documents]]
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Here is the !WebTopicEditTemplate (now ReleaseDocumentation.DocInstallTemplate) for newly created pages in this twiki, which are assumed to be included in other topics.

---++ Screen View
Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:

For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a "screen" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>

---++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a "file" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>

---++ Variables
See WebPreferences for settings of the following variables.

   * OSG release variable: *%<nop>OSG_VERSION%* = %OSG_VERSION%
   * ITB release variable: *%<nop>ITB_VERSION%* = %ITB_VERSION%
   * VDT release variable: *%<nop>VDT_VERSION%* = %VDT_VERSION%
   * Release variable, according to cache (ITB or OSG): *%<nop>VERSION%* = %VERSION%
   * VDT cache variable: *%<nop>VDT_CACHE%* = %VDT_CACHE%
   * ITB/OSG cache/grid variable: *%<nop>CACHE%* = %CACHE%
      * Use the  *%<nop>CACHE%* variable as a generic reference for either "ITB" or "OSG" *caches*, *grids*, etc.  It automatically expands to "ITB" if its in the Integration web, or to "OSG" if its in the production release documentation web.
   * Refer to the cache/version combination that you're using, e.g, %CACHE% %VERSION%, with a space in between, as %BR% %BLUE% %<nop>CACHE% %<nop>VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%
   * Full URL to base of VDT Documentation for current release *%<nop>VDT_DOCS_URL%*: %VDT_DOCS_URL%
   * Full URL to VDT Cache for this release: *%<nop>VDT_CACHE_URL%*: %VDT_CACHE_URL%
   * Full URL to OSG Cache (ITB or Production) for this release *%<nop>OSG_CACHE_URL%*: %OSG_CACHE_URL%
   * Pacman version: *%<nop>PACMAN_VERSION%*: %PACMAN_VERSION%
