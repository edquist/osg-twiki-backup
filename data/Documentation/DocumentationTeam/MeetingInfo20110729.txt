---+ Agenda

---++ Problems Identified

   * About 80 documents are installation type documents; that is the minimum number of documents that need to be changed.
   * The required changes will be substantial; installation and configuration need to be changed (1/2 to 2/3 of lines per document).
   * The existing documentation cannot gradually be changed in their current place; resources using OSG-1.2 and earlier versions require the _old_ documentation till September 2012.
   * Due to the amount of documents that need to be changed, it will not be possible to transition in one big leap.
   * A gradual change will require the _old_ and _new_ documentation to be functional at the same time; a separate development Twiki for the new documentation will complicate this process more than aid it.

---++ Documentation Proposal

   * The documentation architect will create a blue print for the new documentation; it should allow for new technologies or usage scenarios to be in-cooperated more easily than currently the case. It must progress along with the changes made to software stack of the VDT over the next year(s).
   * The first blue print will reflect the current state of the VDT software stack that already transitioned to RPMs. It will be implemented as a skeleton in a new web in the existing Twiki.
   * The OSG community and the VDT software developers will use existing documents as a starting point for the creation of new documents. These new documents will be add step-by-step to the skeleton.
   * The newly created documents in the new web will link back to existing documents in the ReleaseDocumentation web for topics that have not transitioned to the new documentation.
   * Estimated time required per document (4 to 16 hours for editing, 2 hours for reviewing, 2 hours for testing).

---++ Important Dates

   * 08/29/11 : a group of people will meet at the University of Chicago to finish open documentations tasks:
      * Robert Engel
      * Jim Weichel
      * Rob Gardner
      * Suchandra Thapa
      * Marco Mambelli
      * Tanya Levshina
      * if available (Brian Bockelman, Derek Weitzel)
   * 09/30/11 : the documentation will be frozen (no write access outside Twiki admin group) by that time.
   * a realistic estimate for the time required to complete the transition is 1 year.
