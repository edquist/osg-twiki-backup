---+ Agenda


---++ Discuss and Plan the Transition from Pacman to RPM in the VDT

   * since 2002 pacman was used
   * Dan suggest to drop support for Pacman right away, no transition phase
   * release by December
   * pacman will be around for one more year
   * Alain will prepare draft proposal for documentation to be shown during the site admin's workshop
   * Robert will create structure of documents from Alain's proposal
   * VDT team will make changes to copied documents to reflect rpm-based installations
   * Alain, Robert and Jim will evaluate how much work is required to change documents as compared to working from scratch

---++ Pacman vs. RPM based Installation Documents

The part of a document that deals with Pacman is the smallest. It usually is mentioned in 'Requirements', followed by one paragraph that shows the command line to check out the documented software from the Pacman cache. There are however a large number of documents that refer to Pacman (~80). These documents will have to be changed. I haven't seen the new RPM based installation process yet, but let me assume that the change might be as trivial as:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% pacman -get OSG:ce  -> aptitute install osg-ce
</pre>


---++ Loose Ends in CE Documentation

We are not concerned about Pacman when reviewing, testing and releasing documents. The document process is geared towards increasing usability of documents by making sure defined standards are being followed. The instructions will remain mostly the same when using RPMs instead of Pacman. Evey effort we make now to tie loose ends together will benefit the RPM based instructions as well.

---++ Transition Process

I have talked with Alain about the transition process. We agreed that it would be good to move a small subsets of documents from Pacman to RPM now in order to evaluate how work intensive that process really is. Based on the evaluation we will be able to provide an estimate how long the transition will take. From my experience I would say that the uncertainty here is not due to the difficulty of the process itself, but how much support we will get from the OSG community. 

---++ Q: What is the new RPM process going to look like from Admin Point of View?
