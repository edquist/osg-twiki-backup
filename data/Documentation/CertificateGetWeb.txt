---+!! Get or renew a certificate using a web browser

%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%

%TOC%

---++ Warning
If you need to use your certificate for command line grid functions you will probably find it easier to
user the [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateGetCmd][command line interface to getting certificates]].  If you will ONLY use your certificate in
your web browser then the web interface will be the easiest for you.

---++ Requirements
 <noautolink> 
   * Netscape, Mozilla, or Firefox requires JavaScript support. 
   * Internet Explorer requires ActiveX (at the least, in the Internet Options control panel, go to the Security Settings tab and the Advanced settings, and enable Prompt for Download signed ActiveX controls). There have been difficulties reported for using IE7 on Windows Vista. 

---++ Obtain a new certificate via web browser

Print out these instructions, or copy them somewhere so that you can access them without using a browser.

   1 Close all browser sessions. Then establish a new browser session using the same user account on the same machine and same browser (and browser version) as the one in which you plan to initially use your certificate. 
   1 Go to the DOEgrids Subscriber Enrollment page [[https://pki1.doegrids.org/]]. 
   1 Select the Enrollment tab. (We are intentionally steering you away from the front page of the DOEGrid site.) 
   1 Select New user on the left. This takes you to the DOEGrids Subscriber Enrollment page, which contains a form for you to fill out. Fill out the fields as follows: 
      * Subscriber's Identity: Enter your full name as you want it to appear in the certificate. Enter your commonly used email address. 
      * Contact Information: Enter the email address appropriate for the RA (affiliation) you choose. (For example, the FNAL approval process requires that this be a fnal.gov address.) Enter your office phone number at your home institution. Select your affiliation (also called "Registration Authority") from the drop-down menu. 
      * Sponsor Information: Enter the name of your sponsor (your sponsor must be able to vouch for you; he or she is not responsible for approving or denying your request; approval is handled by another process). Enter the sponsor's email address (again, some affiliations require a corresponding email address). Enter the sponsor's telephone number. 
      * Additional Comments: Enter as needed. 
      * Challenge Phrase Password (Optional): It should be required to enter a password! You will need one to export and import your certificate from/to applications, in addition to revocation. Enter and a password, and confirm it. 
      * Public/Private key information: No information to enter ?Microsoft Hotfix May be Required: No information to enter 
      * Cryptographic Provider: 
         * Linux or other Unix Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape users: Select 2048(High grade). 
         * Windows Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape users: Select Strong Cryptographic Provider. 
         * Windows Internet Explorer users: Select Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider. 
      * Click Submit. This generates your private key and stores it in the security database (password and certificate store) associated with your browser, user account, and system. 
   1 In the dialog box that tells you to only allow trusted sites to request a certificate for you and asks you if you want to proceed, click Yes. 
   1 Your browser should then point to a page that says "Request successfully submitted." and displays a request number. Make a note of the request number in case you need to follow up on anything. 

---++ Obtain a new certificate with the SAME DN. How to find out your old DN and request a new certificate with the same DN

This is applicable if you already had a certificate from DOEgrids CA previously and the certificate is expired after a year. You need to get a new certificate, but you want to make sure you will have the same DN. (With the same DN, you can continue accessing the same resources without any re-configuration or changes.) 

Follow the steps given above. At step 4, in Additional comments, enter your old DN and explain you need a new certificate with the same DN. Continue with the rest of the steps. 

How to find out your old DN:

In Internet Explorer: 
   1 Click on Tools, then Internet Options, then Content Tab.
   1 Click on Certificates tab
   1 Click on Personal tab. This shows your own certificates loaded into IE. 
   1 Double click on your certificate. Copy everything shown after the Distinguished Name (DN)

In Firefox: 
   1 Click on Tools, then Options, then Advanced Tab. 
   1 Click on Encryption and then Certificates tabs 
   1 Click on View Certificates
   1 Double click on your certificate. Copy everything shown after the Distinguished Name (DN)



 
---++ Get your certificate and import it into your browser

You will receive email notification from DOEGrids stating whether your request was approved or denied. The email text for an approved request will look similar to the text below. Read it carefully and follow the instructions:

<pre class="file">
  Your Personal certificate request has been processed successfully. 
  SubjectDN= CN=Your Name xxxxxx,OU=People,DC=doegrids,DC=org 
  IssuerDN= CN=DOEGrids CA 1,OU=Certificate Authorities,DC=DOEGrids,DC=org 
  notAfter= Sep 30, 2007 11:45:39 AM ?  notBefore= Sep 30, 2006 11:45:39 AM 
  Serial Number= xxxxxx

To get your certificate, please follow this URL: 
https://pki1.doegrids.org:443/displayBySerial?op=displayBySerial&serialNumber=xxxx 
And then click the 'Import your certificate' button at the bottom of this page. 

Note: Some browsers import successfully without indicating this to you.
  
Attention:  You need to be running the same browser, on the same machine, logged in as the same user, 
as you were when you made the certificate  request.

After importing your certificate, export your certificate and the  private key for Grid use. 
Kindly follow the instructions on http://www.doegrids.org/pages/cert-request.html#Globus
Please contact your RA if there is any problem.
</pre>

%NOTE%
   * If you are using Mozilla or Firefox and have set a Master Password on your Software Security Device (the password and certificate database), a dialog box requesting the Master Password may appear. If so, enter the password to permit the importation of the certificate. 
   * To import your certificate into another browser on the same or a different machine, you first need to export it from the initial browser into a file. For information on importing certificates into a variety of browsers, visit the [[http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/loading_certifs.htm][LCG Users Registration page]] . 

---++ Export (Back up) your certificate
 Follow the [[http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/loading_certifs.htm][LCG instructions for importing your certificate]] , but *select "Export"* instead of "Import". (Firefox calls it "backup".) You will need to make up a password and enter it, in order to export your private key. Remember the password!

Refer to [[SecurityUserResponsibilities][What are users' responsibilities regarding security on OSG?]] for information on how to protect your certificate.

---++  Copy your certificate  for grid use (And optionally convert format)
 For use on grid resources or submit machines, copy it to =$HOME/.globus/usercred.p12= (usercred.p12 fie in $HOME/.globus/ directory)  on that machine. And change its permission: 
<pre class="screen">
 chmod 400 $HOME/.globus/usercred.p12
</pre>

User commands currently support both =p12= and =pem= certificates. There is no need to convert your =p12= certificate, anyway if you like to have also the certificate in =.pem= format, then run the following commands. The first one extracts your public key, the second extracts your private key. 

<pre class="screen">
 openssl pkcs12 -in $HOME/.globus/usercred.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out $HOME/.globus/usercert.pem  
 openssl pkcs12 -in $HOME/.globus/usercred.p12 -nocerts -out $HOME/.globus/userkey.pem
</pre>

You must set the protections on your two new =.pem= files correctly, otherwise =grid-proxy-init= will not use them.
<pre class="screen">
 chmod go-rw ~/.globus/userkey.pem 
 chmod go-w ~/.globus/usercert.pem
</pre>

---++ Renew your certificate in your web browser
If you have a valid DOEGrids certifcate in your web browser that is not expired or revoked, then you can renew it automatically
by visiting the Replacement Certificate
web form of the DOEGrids CA, and follow the brief instructions as described below.
After you have renewed it you can use the instructions in the section above to make a backup copy or export it for other uses.

To renew a certificate, follow these steps:
   1 Go to the [[https://pki1.doegrids.org/ca/CertBasedSingleEnroll.html][Replacement Certificate]] page . 
   1 Read the page carefully. 
   1 Select the appropriate Key Length or Cryptographic Provider (depending upon your browser):
      * Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape users: Select 2048(High grade) 
      * Windows Internet Explorer users: Select Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider.
      * Safari users (choose what?)
   1 When you submit the form, It may prompt you to "choose a certificate". Your old DOEGrids certificate should be displayed; *select it*.
   1 If you receive any prompts about trusting this CA or certificate being installed, select Yes.
   1 Then you will see a message that your certificate has been successfully imported. *Click OK*.
   1 It will display your certificate in base 64 encoded format.
   1 Check your email. You should have received a message from DOEGrids.
   1 Assuming you saw and responded to the set of prompts as listed above, your new certificate is already imported. The way you check for it depends on your browser. If it hasn't been imported, follow the link to the URL given in the email message and click the _Import_ button, as directed in the email message.
   1 If you are an OSG RA Agent or Grid Admin, you will need to send email signed by your new certificate to renew your Agent or Grid Admin role. See [[Security.OsgRaOperations]] for details.

---++ Revoking your certificate
For instructions on revoking your user certificate refer to the [[CertificateRevoke][Revoking a Certificate]] page.


%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
There should probably be a section on revoking the certificate on this page and [[CertificateGetCmd]] page rather than on [[CertificateGet]].
Also not sure what the "?Microsoft Hotfix May be Required" means in section on "Obtain a new certificate via web browser"
 Output/email should probably go either in a twisty or a pre tag
Commands (e.g. openssl) also need to be formatted into code tag.
