---+ Installation of VO application software on OSG sites
%TOC%
---++ Introduction
This page provides OSG-wide guidelines and policies. [[VO/WebHome][Your VO]] must provide specifics for installation/configuration of your VO application.

---++ Installation and configuration advice
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/current/requirements.html][Operating systems and hardware configurations your application must support (same as VDT)]].
   * Prerequisites to installation:
      * ensure that your VO is supported at the site in question;
      * ensure the software installers are authorized to install software in the desired area.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall][Install and use the Pacman software packaging tool]] if your software is packaged using pacman.
   * [[PortingYourApplication][Porting your application to the OSG]].
   * Be sure to stay within any site quotas, and clean up old software as appropriate.

---++ Installation area and space, and installers' credentials
   * The location where the software is installed follows the OSG local storage policy, i.e. it uses $OSG_APP, which is visible to all the worker nodes. 
   * The filesystem represented by $OSG_APP may or may not be writable from the worker nodes. The top-level $OSG_APP directory may or may not be world-writable; you may have to request the creation of a VO-owned directory under $OSG_APP into which your software is installed.
   * Your VO may maintain multiple releases on each OSG site. Given the size of each release, determine how many GB of space you will require on $OSG_APP.
   * We recommend that your VO set up a special "software" role in your VOMS server, and assign it to the software installers (and software developers).%BR%When a job comes to an OSG site gatekeeper, using the "software" role, local site GUMS if (present) may map it to a special VO-specific account, with possibly higher priority on the local batch job system over other user accounts for your VO.%BR%Note this "software" role may be distinct from any "Production" role you may wish to assign to (eg) official jobs using the software to do work. Also your VO's software installed on OSG sites should be owned by a special account, such that it can not be overwritten by "normal" users. Specific account and FQAN mapping requests should be sent to [[mailto:goc@opensciencegrid.org][the GOC]].

---++ Installation Procedure

The installation commands should be put into a script and sent to the remote gatekeeper as a fork job (via globus-job-run or !CondorG). This job should not unduly tax the CE (eg by compiling software).
