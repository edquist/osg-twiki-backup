---+ Installation of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo application software on OSG sites
%TOC%
---++ Introduction
This page provides OSG-wide guidelines and policies. [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/WebHome][Your VO]] must provide specifics for installation/configuration of your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo application.

---++ Installation and configuration advice
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/current/requirements.html][Operating systems and hardware configurations your application must support (same as VDT)]].
   * Prerequisites to installation:
      * ensure that your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is supported at the site in question;
      * ensure the software installers are authorized to install software in the desired area.
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall][Install and use the Pacman software packaging tool]] if your software is packaged using pacman.
   * [[PortingYourApplication][Porting your application to the OSG]].
   * Be sure to stay within any site quotas, and clean up old software as appropriate.

---++ Installation area and space, and installers' credentials
   * The location where the software is installed follows the OSG local storage policy, i.e. it uses $OSG_APP, which is visible to all the worker nodes. 
   * The filesystem represented by $OSG_APP may or may not be writable from the worker nodes. The top-level $OSG_APP directory may or may not be world-writable; you may have to request the creation of a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-owned directory under $OSG_APP into which your software is installed.
   * Your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo may maintain multiple releases on each OSG site. Given the size of each release, determine how many GB of space you will require on $OSG_APP.
   * We recommend that your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo set up a special "software" role in your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server, and assign it to the software installers (and software developers).%BR%When a job comes to an OSG site gatekeeper, using the "software" role, local site GUMS if (present) may map it to a special VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-specific account, with possibly higher priority on the local batch job system over other user accounts for your VO.%BR%Note this "software" role may be distinct from any "Production" role you may wish to assign to (eg) official jobs using the software to do work. Also your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's software installed on OSG sites should be owned by a special account, such that it can not be overwritten by "normal" users. Specific account and FQAN mapping requests should be sent to [[mailto:goc@opensciencegrid.org][the GOC]].

---++ Installation Procedure

The installation commands should be put into a script and sent to the remote gatekeeper as a fork job (via globus-job-run or !CondorG). This job should not unduly tax the CE (eg by compiling software).
