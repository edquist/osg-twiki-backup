   * Never try using streaming of stdout/stderr in Condor-G. Not only does it disable grid_monitor, but it is also disallowed from most sites.If you need to debug running jobs, consider [[http://jobmon.sourceforge.net/][JobMon]] instead. It is much more scalable, puts less load on the site infrastructure, and is more feature rich.
      * Always use grid_monitor. See [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/condorg/goldenrules.html][The Golden Rules of Using Condor]].
   * Avoid =jobmanager-fork= except when installing software..
   * Minimise the number and size of files you transfer in or out of a site using =Condor-G=. Use stage in/out to the OSG storage as described below instead. 
   * Avoid using a single !GridFTP server; use SRM, which can distribute the load amongst several servers.
   * Avoid very short- and long-running jobs.  For opportunistic use, "too short" jobs are those less than 30 minutes; "too long" jobs are those more than 8 hours.  Ideal wall clock time for a job is a few hours.
   * Avoid network mounted disks for IO operations. Always remember: a cluster is a large error amplifier! If you have >100 jobs running in parallel even a modest amount of IO to a network mounted disk can overwhelm the server, and can cause a large mess on the site you are running!
   * Avoid a steady stream of separate job submissions at around the 1-5 Hz rate. You are better off submitting, say 10 at once, and then take a 20 seconds break, than space them equally by 2 seconds. We found that the gridmonitor is unable to handle a steady stream of submits at 0.5 Hz, while it deals with the other pattern quite well. (We will attempt to provide more details on this sort of stuff later)

If you have any additional questions you run into as you scale up your operations on OSG, please feel free to ask other power users for advice by sending email to =osg-sites atSign opensciencegrid DOT org=.
