   * Always use grid_monitor. See [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/condorg/goldenrules.html][The Golden Rules of Using Condor]].
   * Never use streaming of stdout/stderr. Not only does it disable grid_monitor, but it is also disallowed from most sites.If you need to debug running jobs, consider [[http://jobmon.sourceforge.net/][JobMon]] instead. It is much more scalable, puts less load on the site infrastructure, and is more feature rich.
   * Avoid =jobmanager-fork=.
   * Minimise the number and size of files you transfer in or out of a site using =condor-g=. Use stage in/out to the OSG storage as described below instead. 
   * Use SRM instead of gridftp whenever you can.
   * Avoid very short- and long-running jobs. Ideal wall clock time for a job is a few hours.
   * Avoid network mounted disks for IO operations. Always remember: a cluster is a large error amplifier! If you have >100 jobs running in parallel even a modest amount of IO to a network mounted disk can overwhelm the server, and can cause a large mess on the site you are running!
   * Avoid a steady stream of job submissions at around the Hz t couple Hz rate. You are better off submitting, say 10 at once, and then take a 20 seconds break, than space them equally by 2 seconds. We found that the gridmonitor is unable to handle a steady stream of submits at 0.5 Hz, while it deals with the other pattern quite well. (We will attempt to provide more details on this sort of stuff later)

If you have any additional questions you run into as you scale up your operations on OSG, please feel free to ask other power users for advice by sending email to =osg-users atSign opensciencegrid DOT org=.
