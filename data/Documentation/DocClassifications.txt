#DocumentTypes
---+++ Document Types
Documents can be of several different types.  Types are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_TYPE.  The Templates are recommended formatting and sections to be included in the associated document type.
| *Document Type* | *Definition* | *Template* |
| !HowTo | A procedure telling how to do something | DocHowToTemplate |
| Installation | A specific procedural document for installation of software | DocInstallTemplate |
| Knowledge | Any document not of another type.  E.g. general information, explanation, description. | DocBasicTemplate |
| Navigation | A document designed to help a person navigate to other documents | DocBasicTemplate |
| Planning | A document used for planning.  E.g. Planning an OSG site. | DocBasicTemplate |
| Training | A document designed for training or used organize or manage a training event | DocBasicTemplate |
| Troubleshooting | A troubleshooting document | ReleaseDocumentation.DocTroubleshootingTemplate |

---+++ Document User Roles
Each document is written for a person in a certain role (called primary role).  It may also be used by people in another role (called the secondary role).  Since few documents cover multiple roles, we do not specify a secondary role in a document.  Roles are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_ROLE.
| *Document Reader Role* | *Definition* |
| Developer | Any software developer |
| Documenter | Any person working on documentation itself |
| Scientist | A person submitting jobs to the Grid -- an "End User" |
| Student | Any student, who is learning about any part of OSG.  General training material might be for this role.  Specific training specifically written for another role would be classified as that role as primary and student as secondary. |
| !SysAdmin | A computer system administrator, managing a computing resource in OSG |
| VOManager | A manager in a Virtual Organization as contrasted with one of the above roles |

---+++ Document Areas
The documentation universe is segmented into a set of areas, each of which has an owner having overall responsibility for the documentation of that area.  The Areas are defined in the following table and are specified in a document using the [[#ContentManagementVariables][Content Management]] variable DOC_AREA.
| *Documentation Area* | *Definition* | *Area Owner* |
| !ComputeElement | Compute Element | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| !EndUser | End User of OSG resources.  E.g. Typically a Scientist or Student | Main.BrianBockelman |
| General | General documents and documents about documentation itself | Main.RobertEngel |
| Integration | Related to an OSG release or for the Integration Team | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| Monitoring | Monitoring, Accounting, and Metrics | Main.BrianBockelman |
| Operations | Operational procedures or related to GOC services | Main.RobQ |
| Security | Security | Main.MineAltunay |
| Storage | Storage Element or Storage | Main.TanyaLevshina |
| Tier3 | Specific to LHC project Tier 3 Sites | Main.MarcoMambelli |
| Training | Related to training: course plan, content designed for classes or tutorials. | Main.SuchandraThapa |
| VO | Virtual Organization | Main.AbhishekSinghRana |

| Could you put the corresponding HTML variable here for easy reference. %RED%OK, added comment and link to variables for each of the tables.%ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:36 |
| Haven&#39;t we changed the Student role to End User? %RED%Yes, I updated the roles and also fixed an inconsistencies in the other 2 tables.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:37 |
| A comment on other pages, not this one: many release documents have installation and troubleshooting on the same page. %RED%True and that is OK.  The document type of a combined document is that of the primary type, in this case, Installation.  In addition there are some stand alone Troubleshooting documents that will use the Troubleshooting Type | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:06 |
| Should we not use the same phrase &#34;End User&#34;, or such, in Document Areas as in Document User Roles, since it is already so close? %RED%No, we agreed at the workshop to use Scientist for End User (more descriptive).  So for Type we have !HowTo, etc., for Role we have Scientist, and for Area we have !EndUser (that covers %ENDCOLOR%| Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:17 |
