For sites not yet familiar with perfSONAR, we provide a quick overview of what it is and why we recommend its deployment at OSG and WLCG sites.

Distributed scientific computing relies upon networks to interconnect resources and make them usable for scientific workflows.  This dependency upon the network means that issues in our networks can significantly impact the behavior of all the various cyber-infrastructure components that rely upon it.  Compounding the problem is that networks, by their nature, are distributed and typically involve many different "owners" and administrators.  When a problem arises somewhere along a network path, it can be very difficult to identify and localize.
