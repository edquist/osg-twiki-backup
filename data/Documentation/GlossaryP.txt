   $ Pacman: middleware component used in OSG for packaging and distribution of software, developed at Boston U.. Read more at http://physics.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/.

   $ Pacman cache: A pacman cache can be thought of as a collection of virtual applications. It is simply a URL or local file system location containing files with .pacman suffixes, e.g., xyz.pacman. Some caches are "registered" and have nice names like "VDT", and some are just URLs or file system locations. Each xyz.pacman file corresponds to a package xyz.

   $ Pacman file: A .pacman file (e.g., xyz.pacman) contains instructions on how the software in the xyz package is fetched, installed, setup, uninstalled, what other packages it depends on, and so on.

   $ Pacman package: A software environment created by installation of a .pacman file.

   $ Partner: An individual or organization affiliated with a grid external to the Consortium with which the Open Science Grid interacts with through federation of resources.

   $ Permanent storage: A data storage system, or a data collection in a storage system, wherein a physical file can only be created and removed by the owner of the data collection.

   $ Persistent storage: See permanent storage.

   $ Physical file name: (PFN) The URL of a physical replica of a file, minus the protocol.

   $ Pinning (a file): Pinning refers to the capability of an SRM to keep a particular file in non-permanent storage space for a period of time set by the client, prior to making the file eligible for transfer or removal from the SRM. A pin is requested and released by a client. Pinning a file is a way of keeping the file in place, not locking its content (see locking).

   $ Policy: A statement of well-defined requirements, conditions or preferences put forth by a Provider and/or Consumer that is utilized to formulate decisions leading to actions and/or operations within the infrastructure.

   $ Pool<a name="DefsPool"></a>: a virtual data partition in the dCache storage space.

   $ POOL: POOL is an LCG software system and project, developed with US participation. It has been created to implement a common persistency framework for the LCG application area and to replace the Objectivity database system in the US LHC software. POOL is tasked to store experiment data and metadata in the multi Petabyte area in a distributed and grid enabled way. Read more at http://pool.cern.ch/ .

   $ Privilege: The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Privilege Project implements finer-grained authorization for access to grid-enabled resources and services in order to improve user account assignment and management at grid sites, and reduce the associated administrative overhead. Depending on its implementation, privilege relies on, interfaces to and further develops at least some of the following independent pieces of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-implemented and site-implemented authorization software: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS, Grid-map callout interface, PRIMA, GUMS, and SAZ.

   $ PRIMA: PRIvilege Management and Authorization, a component of the privilege project for user authorization at a site, is used with GUMS and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS to implement dynamic, fine-grained, role-based identity mapping. PRIMA extracts the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes containing the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and role information from the user's proxy certificate, and queries GUMS for an appropriate local user account assignment.
