   $ p2p (_dCache_)<a name="DefsP2p"></a>: Pool-to-pool transfers inside a dCache system.
   $ permanent file<a name="DefsPermanentFile"></a>: a file that cannot be removed by the SRM.
   $ permanent space<a name="DefsPermanentSpace"></a>: data storage space that a user or organization owns (no lifetime or expiration).
   $ PFN<a name="DefsPfn"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsPhysicalFileName][Physical File Name]].
   $ Physical File Name (PFN)<a name="DefsPhysicalFileName"></a>: server, port, path and filename for a file. _Ex:_ <pre>cs.berkeley.edu:4004/tmp/racerX</pre>
   $ pinning (files)<a name="DefsPinning"></a>: Request that a file remain in place at a site until it is released. Used for grid file transfers, either pinning a file at the source for movement or pinning it at the target until used and released. Differs from _locking_ which keeps file content from changing.
   $ pnfs layer<a name="DefsPfnsLayer"></a>: _See_ layer. 
   $ pnfs<a name="DefsPfns"></a>: An independent namespace package written at DESY. It presents a collection of library database entries as a UNIX-like file system, and thus allows users to browse stored files as though they reside in this file system. Pnfs is mounted like NFS, but it is a virtual file system only. It maintains file grouping and structure information via a set of tags in each directory. 
   $ pnfs tags<a name="DefsPfnsTags"></a>: _See_ tags. 
   $ pool<a name="DefsPool"></a>: a virtual data partition in the dCache storage space.
   $ pool attraction scheme<a name="DefsPoolAttractionScheme"></a>: 
   $ POSIX I/O<a name="DefsPosixIo"></a>: POSIX standards for I/O. POSIX is "a set of IEEE standards designed to provide application portability between Unix variants." (From [[http://foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?POSIX][FOLDOC]] )
   $ PRIMA<a name="DefsPrima"></a>: an implementation of the Globus authorization callout that allows message exchange  between Globus and Authorization Service using [[#DefsSaml][SAML]] and provides for the grid layer management and delegation of privileges on user-to-user and administrator-to-user bases. 
   $ protocol negotiation<a name="DefsProtocolNegotiation"></a>: matching a client's transfer protocol with SRM storage systems that support it.
