---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% This section documents the history and current status of the *modular dashboard* work.

---++ History of  the Modular Dashboard
The *modular dashboard* development effort started out of the USATLAS Throughput group (chaired by Shawn !McKee).  This group had organized the deployment of perfSONAR-PS toolkits instances (one latency and one bandwidth) at each of the USATLAS Tier-1 and Tier-2 sites starting in 2008.   The deployment was successfully in place by the end of 2009 but it was problematic to get a quick overview of the status of the end-sites and the network metrics they were measuring.   The group discussed creating a central system to gather and display the toolkit and network metrics and initially focused on the _Nagios_ system in place at BNL.   Tom Wlodek/BNL coded a quick visualization of the the infrastructure status using _Nagios_ plugins provided by Andy Lake/ESnet.   This was the start of the *modular dashboard*.

The usefulness of the dashboard quickly prompted additional requests for new features and added functionality.   The project grew from humble beginnings very quickly which exposed some shortcomings in the initial implementation.   Also, the dashboard itself was a significant selling point for sites considering network monitoring.  To be able to quickly and easily see the result of a set of coordinated tests amongst a group of end-sites was very attractive for many potential users.  In June 2010 the [[http://lhcopn.web.cern.ch/lhcopn/][LHCOPN]] voted to deploy perfSONAR-PS toolkits at all the Tier-1 sites (and the Tier-0 at CERN).   By September 2010 all sites were deployed and results were being tracked on a new [[https://perfsonar.racf.bnl.gov:8443/exda/?page=25&cloudName=LHCOPN][LHCOPN dashboard]].  Shortly after that the LHCONE group decided to deploy perfSONAR-PS instances at selected LHCONE sites to track the LHCONE transition.  (Details at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCONE/SiteList )

New LHC sites continued to join with various national scale "clouds" deciding to deploy perfSONAR-PS following on after the LHCONE deployments.   Within the ATLAS collaboration numerous national clouds were deployed during 2011.   By the end of 2011 CMS started deploying instance in the US.   All these new sites significantly strained the dashboard system that was deployed at BNL.  It was not designed for the scale or set of functions it evolved into providing.   By Fall of 2011 the group realized the current dashboard implementation was not sufficient and a new effort to redesign and modularize the dashboard was begun.  

Tom Wlodek spearheaded the initial design, based upon his experience creating and developing the initial dashboard.  Andy Lake was working on a similar activity for ESnet and joined the effort.  Together they produced an [[https://docs.google.com/a/umich.edu/document/d/1NnVNF6TKnTIZkL9BQNyRlqX9dNXH1K-62Ax9rFnZvKE/edit][initial API document]].

---++ Current Status of the Development Effort

Given the importance of having a central place to gather, summarize and display perfSONAR-PS toolkit results, OSG is helping to organize the *Networking Modular Dashboard* development effort.
