---++Introduction

This TWiki page serves as entry point for documentation on how to use the OSG.
As the OSG support model assumes the end-user scientists to be supported by large "Virtual Organizations" (VO)
that provide the actual user interfaces and user support, the primary target audience here are
the VO user support teams, rather than the actual scientists as end-users.

---++Getting Access to computing resorces via OSG

Getting access to computing resources via the OSG involves the following steps:

	* acquire an X509 certificate from one of the <a href="http://blabla.org/">supported CAs</a>. As an example, you might follow these instructions for obtaininga doesciencegrid certificate.
	* Register with your VO. Each VO maintains a VOMS, and probably a VOMRS based interface for end-user scientists to register. The VO may implement policies using <a href="http://blabla.org">groups and roles</a> and extended proxies in order to differentiate access rights and priorities for different end-users. The OSG does support single PIs without the backing of large VOs via the OSG VO. Details for how to join the OSG VO may be found <a href="http://blabla.org/">here</a>.
	* Install an OSG client on your desktop.
   1. Acquire an X.509 certificate from one of the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.10/certificate_authorities.html][supported CAs]]. As an example, you might follow [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-ra/PersonalRequest.php][these instructions]] for obtaining a doesciencegrid certificate.
----+++A word on Poilcies for resource useage
   3. Install the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationGuide][OSG client software]] on your desktop.
The OSG presently does not have any allocations for use of resources. In fact, none of the resources available via the OSG are "owned" by the OSG. The owners, generally large VOs, and IT organizations, including National Labs, fully control useage policies on their resources. The most common policy for resource utilization beyond the resources that your VO owns is "opportunistic use". The interpretation of what this means varies greatly. Some sites allow access to all their "spare" resources to anybody registered with a VO on OSG, others only to a small subset of resources and/or VOs. Some sites interpret "spare" to mean "until a more privileged user arrives", others guarantee a minimum wall clock time for your job once it starts.
----+++A word on Policies for resource usage
There is no policy schema defined for OSG at this point. It is thus not possible to querry a database to determine site policies. Site policy is presently only available to the extend it is specified on the site policy web page linked in via gridcat. The only reliable way to find out policy is to try to run a job.
The OSG does not allocate resources as none of the resources available via the grid are "owned" by the OSG. The owners &#8212; generally large VOs and IT organisations, including national labs &#8212; fully control usage policies on their resources. 

%WARNING% A cluster is a large error amplifier!
All OSG sites are registered with <a hre="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">gridcat</a>. Gridcat maintains information on every site in a DB, and verifies this information regularly. A site that fails a set of functionality tests will "turn red" on the <a hre="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">gridcat web page</a>. 
---++Finding the list of available sites
In addition to the basic information available via the <a hre="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">gridcat web page</a>
more detailed information, e.g. network architecture (Open, NAT, closed), can be obtained via ldap queries to the site. Examples for this can be found here.(need to add this!)

To find out whether or not your VO is supported by a specific site, you might find
---++++Golden Rules for power users
const int CONDOR_HOLD_CODE_UploadFileError = 13;
---++Stuff that's still missing on this page

What do we need to document here?


How to find out what sites exist:<br>
  * a word about gridcat
  * an example for how to query information from the site ldap or gridcat
  * not clear that we want people to query site ldap servers!
  * description for how to figure out that you have or have not access to a site.

How to submit a job to OSG using condor-g:<br>
  * simple condor-g job to the site's queue
  * basically reproduce the examples on the UCSD tier-2 user docs.

How to use storage on OSG:<br>
  * link to LocalStorageUse twiki
  * something about srmcp ?
  * something about how to request access to srm at sites?
  * Should we have a listserv via which one can request an account at all srm's on osg?

Documentation for power users:<br>
  * document interesting fields in glue schema
  * document condor-g scalability

How to complain:<br>
  * document how to generate a trouble ticket.
  * clarify what warrants a trouble ticket against a site.

Table with twiki pages for all the VOs who maintain twiki pages on this site.

I think that's pretty much it.

   * A standard script like the examples on this page works when submitted to jobmanager-fork but fails on the worker node for whatever reason.
   * You arrive at the worker node but have no grid proxy, are missing srmcp in your path, or are missing some other client tools that should be part of the OSG WN client installation.

   * You can't authenticate at Site X. Unfortunately, OSG rules do not require you to have access to any site in particular. It's up to the site to support you and your VO. Some sites support some VOs without supporting all of their users. At present, the only way to understand the intentions of a site is to query its ldap, and see if your VO shows up in there. The best way to understand if authentication should work for you personally is to check the VO support matrix, and look for your DN among the DNs supported at Site X. If you find that an unreasonable number of sites don't let you in you should send the list of sites where you failed to osg-users at opensciencegrid.org and maybe we can help you gain access to more sites.
   * You find that perl, python, wget, etc. are either not installed at all, or not installed with the version you'd expect given the OS version that the sit is supposed to have. Unfortunately, you are out of luck in that case. There is no definition for a minimal Linux distro that would clearly specify what should exist on a worker node. If you need something and find it missing you may have to either give up on that site or install it yourself into $OSG_APP .
