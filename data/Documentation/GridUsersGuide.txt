   * You can't authenticate at Site X. Unfortunately, OSG rules do not require you to have access to any site in particular. It's up to the site to support you and your VO. Some sites support some VOs without supporting all of their users. At present, the only way to understand the intentions of a site is to query its ldap, and see if your VO shows up in there. The best way to understand if authentication should work for you personally is to check the VO support matrix, and look for your DN among the DNs supported at Site X. If you find that an unreasonable number of sites don't let you in you should send the list of sites where you failed to osg-users at opensciencegrid.org and maybe we can help you gain access to more sites.
   * You find that perl, python, wget, etc. are either not installed at all, or not installed with the version you'd expect given the OS version that the sit is supposed to have. Unfortunately, you are out of luck in that case. There is no definition for a minimal Linux distro that would clearly specify what should exist on a worker node. If you need something and find it missing you may have to either give up on that site or install it yourself into $OSG_APP .
