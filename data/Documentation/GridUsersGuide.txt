What do we need to document here?

How to get access to OSG:<br>
  * a link to how to get doesciencegrid certificate
  * a link for how to do an osg client installation
  * a link for how to join the OSG VO

How to find out what sites exist:<br>
  * a word about gridcat
  * an example for how to query information from the site ldap or gridcat
  * not clear that we want people to query site ldap servers!
  * description for how to figure out that you have or have not access to a site.

How to submit a job to OSG using condor-g:<br>
  * simple condor-g job to the site's queue
  * basically reproduce the examples on the UCSD tier-2 user docs.

How to use storage on OSG:<br>
  * link to LocalStorageUse twiki
  * something about srmcp ?
  * something about how to request access to srm at sites?
  * Should we have a listserv via which one can request an account at all srm's on osg?

Documentation for power users:<br>
  * document interesting fields in glue schema
  * document condor-g scalability

How to complain:<br>
  * document how to generate a trouble ticket.
  * clarify what warrants a trouble ticket against a site.

Table with twiki pages for all the VOs who maintain twiki pages on this site.

I think that's pretty much it.

   * A standard script like the examples on this page works when submitted to jobmanager-fork but fails on the worker node for whatever reason.
   * You arrive at the worker node but have no grid proxy, are missing srmcp in your path, or are missing some other client tools that should be part of the OSG WN client installation.

   * You can't authenticate at Site X. Unfortunately, OSG rules do not require you to have access to any site in particular. It's up to the site to support you and your VO. Some sites support some VOs without supporting all of their users. At present, the only way to understand the intentions of a site is to query its ldap, and see if your VO shows up in there. The best way to understand if authentication should work for you personally is to check the VO support matrix, and look for your DN among the DNs supported at Site X. If you find that an unreasonable number of sites don't let you in you should send the list of sites where you failed to osg-users at opensciencegrid.org and maybe we can help you gain access to more sites.
   * You find that perl, python, wget, etc. are either not installed at all, or not installed with the version you'd expect given the OS version that the sit is supposed to have. Unfortunately, you are out of luck in that case. There is no definition for a minimal Linux distro that would clearly specify what should exist on a worker node. If you need something and find it missing you may have to either give up on that site or install it yourself into $OSG_APP .
