---++ High-level overview of security and authorization on the OSG.

If you want to get access to the clusters on the OSG, there are two important concepts you should understand:
   * *Authentication*: The act of a remote site to verifying your identity.  The real-world analog is a passport; this document links your person to your name.  Similarly, when you run on the grid, you use a certificate to link your jobs to your name.  We have extensive documentation for [[Documentation/CertificateWhatIs][getting grid certificates here]], but your organization may have their own documentation.
   * *Authorization*: The remote site's decision whether to allow you to access to the resource, given your authentication.  To continue to passport analogy, the authorization is when a country decides whether to allow you to enter its borders when presented with your passport.

When you run on the grid, the remote site usually does not handle authorization on a person-by-person basis; this would be rather difficult for sites to work with organizations with hundreds or thousands of users.  The decision is handled on a per-organization basis (in the OSG, we refer these to the "Virtual Organizations" or VOs).  The site usually allows the entire VO access to the site, and runs their jobs as a particular Unix user.

For example, the site "Nebraska" has decided to map all members of the NYSGrid VO to the "nysgrid" unix user account.  More complex models exist; each VO can define a group of users that can get mapped to a specific user at the site.  The VO may also request that each user in its organization gets a unique user name (such as mapping CMS users to uscmsPoolXYZ, where XYZ is some integer).  The VO can suggest a mapping, but sites are not required to follow them.

Hence, you should be prepared to be mapped to the same unix user name as other members of your VO; they will be able to read and write the same files you can.

If you want access to more resources, you should contact your VO and ask them to work on getting authorized at more sites.  Many VOs (such as CMS or ATLAS) have their own resources and support contacts that you can look up in their own documentation.  If in doubt, you can [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open][file a GOC ticket]] or [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][look up your VO manager's contact information]].  Upon request, the OSG VO forum can help your VO interact with sites to arrange opportunistic access.

----+++A word on Policies for Resource Usage

The OSG does not allocate resources as none of the resources available via the grid are "owned" by the OSG. The owners (generally large VOs, universities, or national labs) fully control usage policies on their resources. 

Many resource providers allow you to use resources beyond those owned by the VO. The most common policy for resource utilization outside your own VO is "opportunistic use". The interpretation of this varies greatly. Some sites allow access to all their "spare" resources to anybody registered with a VO on OSG, others to only a small subset of resources and/or VOs. Some sites interpret "spare" to mean "until a more privileged user arrives", others guarantee a minimum wall clock time for your job once it starts.

The only 100% reliable way to find out if you have access is to try to run a job, although we'll cover several fairly accurate methods for discovering clusters quickly in the next section.
