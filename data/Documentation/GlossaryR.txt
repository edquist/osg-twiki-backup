   $ reliable file transfer: a service layer sitting on top of [[#DefsGridFtp][GridFTP]] that will retry file transfers.
   $ replacement policy<a name="DefsReplacementPolicy">: how an [[#DefsSrm][SRM]] should dynamically decide which file to replace when space is needed. Similar to disk caching algorithms but much more complex.
   $ replica catalog<a name="DefsReplicaCatalog"></a>: Stores information on locations of replicated files. Maps logical file to multiple site-specific files (described by machine, port, path and filename). _Also called_ local replica catalog (LRC).
   $ replica location service (RLS)<a name="DefsReplicaLocationService"></a>: _Also_ Globus RLS. Grid service that maps logical filenames to physical filenames and consists of two components the [[#DefsReplicaCatalog][local replica catalog (LRC)]] and the [[#DefsReplicationLocationIndex][replica location index (RLI)]].
   $ Replica Manager Module (RMM)<a name="DefsReplicaManagerModule"></a>: _Also_ File Replica Manager Module. (dCache) Enforces the existence of both a minimum and maximum file copies within the system.
   $ Replica Registration Service (RRS)<a name="#DefsReplicaRegistrationService"></a>: component that registers data in a [[#DefsReplicaCatalog][Replica Catalog]].
   $ replication<a name="DefsReplication"></a>: used for managing copies of file instances, or replicas, within specified storage systems. _[[#HUB04][ref]]_
   $ request<a name="DefsRequest"></a>: (Enstore) After a user submits a job to encp, encp sends a request to Enstore to process the job. _See also:_ job. 
   $ Request Executor<a name="DefsRequestExecutor"></a>:   Process that executes the [[#DefsRequestPlanner][Request Planner]]'s plan. The Condor Project's DAGMAN is an example of a request executor.  
   $ Request Interpreter<a name="DefsRequestInterpreter"></a>:  
   $ Request Manager<a name="DefsRequestManager"></a>: Performs request planning based on some strategy and executes that plan. 
   $ Request Planner<a name="DefsRequestPlanner"></a>:  component that determines the best way to run a job by consulting metadata catalogs, [[#DefsReplicaCatalog][file replica catalogs]], monitoring information (e.g., [[#DefsNetworkWeaterService][Network Weather Service]], etc. [[#Ssg03][(SSG03)]]
   $ resource layer<a href="#DefsResourceLayer"></a>: third of five layers to support grid applications. Includes components and protocols for managing resources, e.g. [[#DefsStorageResourceManager][SRM]]
   $ resubmit<a name="DefsResubmit"></a>: (encp) To make a request again if it has been waiting for a mover for over 15 minutes, but not due to an error condition. _See also:_ [[#DefsRetry][retry]]. 
   $ retry<a name="DefsRetry"></a>: (encp) To will resend a request after an error occurs. _See also:_ [[#DefsResumbit][resubmit]]. 
   $ RRS<a name="#DefsRss"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsReplicaRegistrationService][Replica Registration Service]].
