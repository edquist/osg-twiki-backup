#DefsBDII
   $ BDII:  Berkeley Database Information Index (BDII) is an LCG implementation of Globus GIIS-like information index based on the Berkeley Database.

   $ !BeStMan:  Berkeley Storage Manager (!BeStMan) is an Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) implementation of Storage Resource Manager ([[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsSrm][SRM]]) based on Unix disks and the High Performance Storage System [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsHpss][HPSS]]. _See also_ https://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman/.

#DefsBrokering
   $ Brokering:  In the context of a Storage Resource Manager ([[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsSrm][SRM]]), brokering is contacting the source location to [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsPin][pin]] a file and then invoke a transfer service to get the file when the file is not locally available.

   $ batch slot<a name="DefsBatchSlot"></a>: ?????
   $ best effort (in storage reservation)<a name="DefsBestEffort"></a>: a local policy at SRMs that attempts to efficiently use scarce resources by making storage space reservations _advisory_; space is only allocated as it is claimed, meaning that the client may need to find new storage dynamically. Normally, the site guarantees some minimum for reservations. 
   $ bfid<a name="DefsBfid"></a>: _See_ Bit file ID.
   $ bit file ID<a name="DefsBitFileId"></a>: An Enstore-assigned, unique identifier for a data file. 
   $ Bloom filter<a name="BloomFilter"></a>: a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False positives are possible, but false negatives are not. Used in [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsReplicaLocationService][Globus RLS]].
