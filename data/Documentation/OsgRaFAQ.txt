---+ Frequently Asked Questions about Certificates
%TOC%

---++ Web Browser Questions
---+++ Safari
---++++ How do I import my certificate into Safari?
Certificate should be in the form of a PKCS12 file (.p12 extension).<br>
A1: in a terminal window type "open _certificatate.p12_ "<br>
A2: double click on _certificate.p12_ file<br>
This will start Keychain Access to import your certificate.

---++ Grid Admin issues
---+++ SSL Server flag is not set in Netscape Cert Type extension
A bug in the CA (being worked on) does not set the SSL Server flag of the
NS Cert Type extension when using the cert-gridadmin script *unless*
the SSL Server flag is set in the personal certificate you use to authenticate
the gridadmin request.

*Work around*
<pre class="screen">
 - cd to an empty directory (it helps)
 - execute cert-gridadmin with <b>-dryrun -noclean</b>  flags
    this generates two files ...req.pem and ...key.pem
 - post the contents of the ...req.pem file into the gridadmin web form
 - view the generated certificate and copy the text from
  ---------BEGIN CERTIFICATE--------- to
  ---------END CERTIFICATE----------
  to a file ...cert.pem.
  Now ...cert.pem and ...key.pem are the certificate and private key.
  Note that if you use the -prefix option of cert-gridadmin you
   get to specify what ... is.
</pre>
