---+ How can I help ensure that the next release of OSG software runs on my systems?
%EDITTHIS%
%STARTINCLUDE%
We encourage you to participate in testing and validating the OSG software prior to its release. To do so, you need to participate in the Trash/Integration Test Bed (ITB) and attend the weekly integration meetings. For information about the ITB, see [[Documentation/Trash/IntegrationGridWhatIs][What is the integration grid?]] and the [[Trash/Trash/Integration/WebHome#Contact_Information][Trash/Integration Contacts]].

To contact members of the integration group, send email to =osg-int@opensciencegrid.org=.
