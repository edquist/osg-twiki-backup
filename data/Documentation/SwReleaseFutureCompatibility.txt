---+ How can I help ensure that the next release of OSG software runs on my systems?
%EDITTHIS%
%STARTINCLUDE%
We encourage you to participate in testing and validating the OSG software prior to its release. To do so, you need to participate in the Integration Test Bed (ITB) and attend the weekly integration meetings. For information about the ITB, see [[Documentation/IntegrationGridWhatIs][What is the integration grid?]] and the [[Integration/WebHome#Contact_Information][Integration Contacts]].

To contact members of the integration group, send email to =osg-int@opensciencegrid.org=.
