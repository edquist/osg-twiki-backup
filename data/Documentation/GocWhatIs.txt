---+ What is the Grid Operations Center (GOC) and how do I contact it?

Read about the GOC in the website at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Getting_Started/Support][Grid Support and Operations]].

<!--
Based at Indiana University, the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC)
provides 24x7 support, engineering, and infrastructure to enable and
facilitate the distributed support structure, i.e., the underpinning
and glue for grid-wide operations and support. The GOC performs
real-time grid monitoring; performs problem and incident tracking and
resolution; maintains information resources; supports provisioning and
testbeds; and maintains the OSG and Service Administration Virtual
Organizations (VOs). It serves as the support center for matters of
grid-wide and inter-Support Center scope, and provides support for
users, developers, and system administrators for matters that extend
beyond the scope of the distributed Support Centers.
-->
You may contact the GOC 24x7 via email ( goc@opensciencegrid.org ) or
by phone at +1 317-278-9699.
