Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues
   * On EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
