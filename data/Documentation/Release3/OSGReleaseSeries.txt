---+ About This Document
This document introduces the different OSG Series and how to update to a new one.

---+ Intro to OSG Series
An OSG Series contains a set of software packages that can be installed together to support various OSG operations.  A series contains rpm repositories designated for development, testing, and release of packages. Once a software package has made it to release, it will be supported for the lifetime of the series.

When a new OSG Series is released, it is an opportunity to add new software packages, make major updates to the versions of existing packages, and remove obsolete packages.  When a new series is initially released, most of the software packages may be identical to the previous release, but two parallel series may diverge over time.

---+ OSG 3.1 and 3.2
OSG 3.1 was the only series available from 24-Apr-2012 until 11-Nov-2013, and will continue to be available and supported for some time into the future.

OSG 3.2 became available on 12-Nov-2013.  It contains major updates to glideinWMS (3.2.0), HTCondor (8.0.4) and Hadoop/HDFS (2.0.0), and support was removed for CEMonitor.

---+ OSG Upcoming
There is one more OSG Series called "upcoming" which contains major updates planned for a future release series.  The yum repositories for upcoming (eg, osg-upcoming, osg-upcoming-testing) are available from both OSG 3.1 and 3.2, and individual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series.

---+ Installing an OSG Series
See YumRepositories (under "Install OSG Repositories") for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.

---+ Updating from OSG 3.1 to 3.2
   1. If you have an existing installation of OSG 3.1 and are upgrading to 3.2, we recommend first removing the 3.1 yum repositories:\
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -e osg-release</pre>
   This step ensures that any local modifications to =*.repo= files will not prevent installing the new 3.2 repos.  Any modified =*.repo= files should appear under =/etc/yum.repos.d/= with the =*.rpmsave= extension.  After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the =*.rpmsave= files to the new =*.repo= files.
   1. <p>Install the OSG repositories:</p>\
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh %RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%</pre>\
    <p>Where =%RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%= is one of the following:</p>

| *Series* | *EL5 URL (for RHEL5, !CentOS5, or SL5)* | *EL6 URL (for RHEL6, !CentOS6, or SL6)* |
| *OSG 3.1* | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el6-release-latest.rpm= |
| *OSG 3.2* | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm= |
