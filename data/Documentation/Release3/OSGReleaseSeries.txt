---+ About This Document

This document introduces the different OSG release series and how to update from one to a newer one.

---+ Introduction to OSG Series

An OSG release series is what it sounds like! That is, each series is a sequence of OSG software releases. For example, the 3.2 release series contains OSG software 3.2.0, 3.2.1, &hellip;, 3.2.26, etc. Further, a release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and production use. The Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release series, even though they may share some packages in common. A particular release within a series is really just a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time. Generally, when you install software from a release series, say 3.2, you get the most current versions of software packages within that series, regardless of the current release version.

When a new OSG Series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make substantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages. When a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series will diverge over time.

---+ OSG Release Series

Since the start of the RPM-based OSG software stack, we have offered the following release series:

   * *OSG 3.1* started in April 2012, and was end-of-lifed in April 2015. \
     While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. \
     Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1; we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.

   * *OSG 3.2* started in November 2013, and was end-of-lifed in August 2016. While the files have not been removed, it is strongly recommended that it not be installed anymore. The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0; also the !gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.

   * *OSG 3.3* started in August 2015, and is still available today. \
     The main differences between it and 3.2 are the dropping of EL5 support, the addition of EL7 support, and the dropping of Globus GRAM support.

   * *OSG 3.4* will start June 13, 2017. \
     The main differences between it and 3.3 are the removal of edg-mkgridmap, GUMS, !BeStMan, and VOMS Admin Server packages.

---+ OSG Upcoming

There is one more OSG Series called "upcoming" which contains major updates planned for a future release series.  The yum repositories for upcoming (eg, osg-upcoming, osg-upcoming-testing) are available from all OSG 3.x series, and individual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series.
Note, however, that packages in the "upcoming" repositories are tested against the most recent OSG series.

---+ Installing an OSG Release Series

See YumRepositories (under "Install OSG Repositories") for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.

#UpdatingOsgRelease
---+ Updating from OSG 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 to 3.3 or 3.4

<ol>
   <li>
      <p>If you have an existing installation based on OSG 3.1, 3.2, or 3.3 (which will be referred to as the _old series_), and want to upgrade to 3.3 or 3.4 (the _new series_), we recommend the following procedure:</p>
      <p>First, remove the old series yum repositories:</p> \
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -e osg-release</pre>
      <p>This step ensures that any local modifications to =*.repo= files will not prevent installing the new series repos.
         Any modified =*.repo= files should appear under =/etc/yum.repos.d/= with the =*.rpmsave= extension.
         After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the =*.rpmsave= files to the new =*.repo= files.</p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>Install the OSG repositories:</p>\
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh %RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%</pre>\
      <p>Where =%RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%= is one of the following:</p>
| *Series* | *EL5 URL (for RHEL5, !CentOS5, or SL5)* | *EL6 URL (for RHEL6, !CentOS6, or SL6)* | *EL7 URL (for RHEL7, !CentOS7, or SL7)* |
| *OSG 3.1* (unsupported) | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el6-release-latest.rpm= | N/A |
| *OSG 3.2* (unsupported) | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm= | N/A |
| *OSG 3.3* | N/A | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el6-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.3/osg-3.3-el7-release-latest.rpm= |
| *OSG 3.4* | N/A | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el6-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.4/osg-3.4-el7-release-latest.rpm= |
%STARTSECTION{"Update"}%
    <li>
      <p>Clean yum cache:</p>
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum clean all --enablerepo=*</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Update software:</p>
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update</pre>
      <p>This command will update *all* packages on your system.</p>
    </li>
%ENDSECTION{"Update"}%
  </ol>

---++ Migrating from edg-mkgridmap to LCMAPS VOMS Plugin

The program edg-mkgridmap (found in the package =edg-mkgridmap=), used for authentication on HTCondor-CE, !GridFTP, and !XRootD hosts, is no longer available starting in OSG 3.4. The LCMAPS VOMS plugin (package =lcmaps-plugins-voms=) now provides the same functionality. To migrate from edg-mkgridmap to the LCMAPS VOMS plugin, perform the following procedure (after following the above update instructions):

   1. Ensure =lcmaps-plugins-voms= and =vo-client-lcmaps-voms= are installed:\
   <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -q lcmaps-plugins-voms vo-client-lcmaps-voms</pre>
   1. Follow the instructions for configuring the [[Documentation.Release3/InstallLcmapsVoms][LCMAPS VOMS plugin]]
   1. Configure user DN mappings:
      * If you have a local grid mapfile (see [[Documentation.Release3/Edg-mkgridmap#3_0_Configuration][this section]]), replace the contents of =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= with the contents of the local grid mapfile.
      * If you do not have a local grid mapfile, remove =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile=.
   1. Remove HTCondor-CE =GRIDMAP= configuration.
      1. Find the location of this configuration using the following command:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% condor_ce_config_val -v GRIDMAP</pre>
      1. Delete the line that sets the =GRIDMAP= configuration variable
      1. Reconfigure HTCondor-CE:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% condor_ce_reconfig</pre>
   1. Remove edg-mkgridmap and related packages:\
   <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum erase edg-mkgridmap</pre>
     %NOTE% In the output from this command, yum should *not* list other packages than the one. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their OSG 3.3 (or 3.4) versions (they should have ".osg33" or ".osg34" in their versions), and try again.

---++ Updating from Frontier Squid 2.7 to Frontier Squid 3.5 (upgrading from OSG 3.3)

The program frontier-squid received a major version upgrade (versions 2.7 to 3.5) between OSG 3.3 and OSG 3.4. Follow the [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Frontier/InstallSquid#Upgrading][upstream upgrade documentation]] when transitioning your squid server to OSG 3.4.

---++ Uninstalling !BeStMan2 from the Storage Element (upgrading to OSG 3.4)

The program !BeStMan2 is no longer available in OSG 3.4 and its functionality has been replaced by [[Documentation.Release3/LoadBalancedGridFTP][load-balanced GridFTP]]. To update your storage element to OSG 3.4, you must perform the following procedure:

   1. Ensure that OSG !BeStMan packages are installed:\
   <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -q osg-se-bestman</pre>
   1. Stop the =bestman2= service:\
   <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service bestman2 stop</pre>
   1. Uninstall the software:\
   <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum erase bestman2-tester-libs bestman2-common-libs bestman2-server-libs bestman2-server-dep-libs bestman2-client-libs bestman2-tester bestman2-client bestman2-server osg-se-bestman</pre>\
   %NOTE% In the output from this command, yum should *not* list other packages than those nine. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their latest OSG 3.3 versions, and try again.

After successfully removing !BeStMan2, continue updating your host to OSG 3.4 by following the [[#UpdatingOsgRelease][instructions above]].

---++ Uninstalling OSG Info Services from the Compute Element (upgrading from OSG 3.3 or 3.2)

The program OSG Info Services is no longer required on OSG 3.3, and is no longer available starting in OSG 3.4.
This is because the service that OSG Info Services reported to, named BDII, has been retired and is no longer functional.

To cleanly uninstall OSG Info Services from your CE, perform the following procedure (after following the main update instructions above):

   1. Ensure that you are using a sufficiently new version of the =osg-ce= metapackages:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">[root@ce ~]# rpm -q osg-ce</pre>\
      should be at least 3.3-12 (OSG 3.3) or 3.4-1 (OSG 3.4). If not, update them:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">[root@ce ~]# yum update osg-ce\*</pre>
   1. Stop the =osg-info-services= service:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">[root@ce ~]# service osg-info-services stop</pre>
   1. Uninstall the software:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">[root@ce ~]# yum erase gip osg-info-services</pre>\
      %NOTE% In the output from this command, yum should *not* list other packages than those two. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their latest OSG 3.3 (or 3.4) versions, and try again.


---++ Uninstalling CEMon from the Compute Element (upgrading from OSG 3.1)

The program CEMon (found in the package =glite-ce-monitor=) is no longer available starting in OSG 3.2.
Its functionality is no longer required because the service that CEMon reported to has been retired and is no longer functional.

To cleanly uninstall CEMon from your CE, perform the following procedure (after following the main update instructions above):

   1. Ensure that you are using a sufficiently new version of the =osg-ce= metapackages:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">[root@ce ~]# rpm -q osg-ce</pre>\
      should be at least 3.3-12 (OSG 3.3) or 3.4-1 (OSG 3.4). If not, update them:\
      <pre class="rootscreen">[root@ce ~]# yum update osg-ce\*</pre>
   1. If there is a CEMon configuration file at =/etc/osg/config.d/30-cemon.ini=, remove it
   1. Remove CEMon and related packages:<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@ce ~]# yum erase glite-ce-monitor glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin osg-configure-cemon</pre>\
     %NOTE% In the output from this command, yum should *not* list other packages than those three. If it lists other packages, cancel the erase operation, make sure the other packages are updated to their OSG 3.3 (or 3.4) versions (they should have ".osg33" or ".osg34" in their versions), and try again.
