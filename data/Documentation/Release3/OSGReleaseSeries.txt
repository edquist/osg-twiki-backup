---+ About This Document

This document introduces the different OSG release series and how to update from one to a newer one.

---+ Introduction to OSG Series

An OSG release series is what it sounds like! That is, each series is a sequence of OSG software releases. For example, the 3.1 release series contains OSG software 3.1.0, 3.1.1, &hellip;, 3.1.26, etc. Further, a release series corresponds to a set of Yum software repositories, including ones for development, testing, and production use. The Yum repositories for one release series are completely distinct from the repositories for a different release series, even though they may share some packages in common. A particular release within a series is really just a snapshot of packages and their exact versions at one point in time. Generally, when you install software from a release series, say 3.1, you get the most current versions of software packages within that series, regardless of the current release version.

When a new OSG Series is released, it is an opportunity for the OSG Technology area to add major new software packages, make substantial updates to existing packages, and remove obsolete packages. When a new series is initially released, most packages are identical to the previous release, but two adjacent series will diverge over time.

---+ OSG Release Series

Since the start of the RPM-based OSG software stack, we have offered the following release series:

   * *OSG 3.1* started in April 2012, and is still available today. Historically, there were 3.0.x releases as well, but there was no separate release series for 3.0 and 3.1; we simply went from 3.0.10 to 3.1.0 in the same repositories.

   * *OSG 3.2* started in November 2013, and is still available today. The main differences between it and 3.1 were the introduction of glideinWMS 3.2, HTCondor 8.0, and Hadoop/HDFS 2.0; also the !gLite CE Monitor system was dropped in favor of osg-info-services.

---+ OSG Upcoming

There is one more OSG Series called "upcoming" which contains major updates planned for a future release series.  The yum repositories for upcoming (eg, osg-upcoming, osg-upcoming-testing) are available from both OSG 3.1 and 3.2, and individual packages can be installed from Upcoming without needing to update entirely to a new series.

---+ Installing an OSG Release Series

See YumRepositories (under "Install OSG Repositories") for instructions on installing the OSG repositories.

---+ Updating from OSG 3.1 to 3.2

   1. If you have an existing installation based on OSG 3.1 and want to upgrade to 3.2, we recommend first removing the 3.1 yum repositories:\
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -e osg-release</pre>
   This step ensures that any local modifications to =*.repo= files will not prevent installing the new 3.2 repos.  Any modified =*.repo= files should appear under =/etc/yum.repos.d/= with the =*.rpmsave= extension.  After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the =*.rpmsave= files to the new =*.repo= files.
   1. <p>Install the OSG repositories:</p>\
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh %RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%</pre>\
    <p>Where =%RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%= is one of the following:</p>

| *Series* | *EL5 URL (for RHEL5, !CentOS5, or SL5)* | *EL6 URL (for RHEL6, !CentOS6, or SL6)* |
| *OSG 3.1* | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el6-release-latest.rpm= |
| *OSG 3.2* | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm= |
