---+ How to setup Condor's Hawkeye monitoring

This section describes how to setup a feature called Condor Startd Cron (sometime also called Hawkeye).
The Condor Startd Cron allows to insert !ClassAds as result of the execution of a custom script.
This can be used to monitor a host and cause conditional scheduling.
You may find this useful if you are sharing the cluster with other users and want that to affect your scheduling.

The following is is an example that you may modify for your need.

For clarity we choose Proof as name of an heavy application. We want to avoid job scheduling when Proof is running.

---++ Description
This control is done completely on the worker node that decides whether to make the job slot available or not and whether a running job should be suspended or be allowed to complete.


Condor / PROOF interaction information: 

this goes into the local config file for the execute machine:
<pre  class="file">
================================================================
# For more information check for STARTD_CRON in Condor manual 3.3.10 
# invoke a module every 30 seconds
STARTD_CRON_JOBLIST = PSPROOF
STARTD_CRON_PSPROOF_EXECUTABLE = /export/share/condor-etc/modules/psproof
STARTD_CRON_PSPROOF_PERIOD = 30s
STARTD_CRON_PSPROOF_MODE = Periodic
# In periodic mode the whole output is collected and processed at once, the last definition of each variable is the one added as machine attribute
#   In wait for exit mode the monitoring of the output is live

# use the output of that module to control policy
# you could also use PREEMPT instead of SUSPEND if desired
# PROOF_IS_RUNNING is the named attribute returned by the program below
SUSPEND = (PROOF_IS_RUNNING =?= True)
CONTINUE = (PROOF_IS_RUNNING =!= True)
================================================================
</pre>

Everything coming out from stdout will be directly added as machine attribute.

Here's a sample code for =/export/share/condor-etc/modules/psproof=.  
You can have the script do whatever you want so long as it outputs the
attribute=value pair to standard out:
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh

ps auxwwww | grep %RED%myproof%ENDCOLOR% | grep -v grep > /dev/null
foundproof=$?

if [ $foundproof -eq 0 ]
then
  echo "PROOF_IS_RUNNING = True"
else
  echo "PROOF_IS_RUNNING = False"
fi
</pre>

The cron information above causes Condor to periodically (every 30 seconds) invoke the module =/export/share/condor-etc/modules/psproof=.  
This module must output to stdout an attribute=value pair that gets inserted into the machine ad.
I used the attribute name "PROOF_IS_RUNNING" that is added when the script finds a process called %RED%<tt>myproof</tt>%ENDCOLOR% running on the machine where it is invoked.  
Then, in the local config file, I set the SUSPEND/CONTINUE policy to use this attribute.

---+ Setup for HTPC (whole machine) Jobs 

---+ Setup a Service Job Slot for Condor
Condor is not a great way to run administrative tasks against loads of machines:
   * You don't know what you hit and what you missed. Condor pools are dynamic
   * Your jobs don't run as privileged accounts. Unless of changes that weaken the security of the system
   * You cannot target a specific system like when connecting to the machine or using =condor_ssh_to_job=

Anyway in limited case it can still be useful.
The basic idea is to add an extra slot for each normal job execution slot. This extra slot will run commands from the user whose job is running on the corresponding execution slot. Typical commands would be things like 'ls' or 'top'.
---++ Configuration 
In the Condor configuration (startd):
<pre class="file">
# Enable multiple slots
NUM_CPUS = $(DETECTED_CORES)+1
SLOT_TYPE_1 = cpus=1, memory=1, swap=1, disk=1
%SLOT_TYPE_1 = cpus=1, memory=0, swap=0, disk=0
#SLOT_TYPE_1 = cpus=1, memory=1%, swap=1%, disk=1%
NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_1 = 1
SLOT_TYPE_2 = cpus=1
NUM_SLOTS_TYPE_2 = $(DETECTED_CORES)

# Enable cross_slot information flow
STARTD_SLOT_EXPRS = $(STARTD_SLOT_EXPRS) State, RemoteUser

# Config one slot for monitoring and one for jobs
#SLOT1_SLOT2_MATCH = (slot2_State=?="Claimed")&&(slot2_RemoteUser=?=User)
# WARNING: THERE MUST BE AN ENTRY FOR ALL SLOTS
# IN THE EXPRESSION BELOW.  If you have more slots, you must
# extend this expression to cover them.  If you have fewer
# slots, extra entries are harmless.
SLOT1_SLOT2_MATCH = \
   (Slot2_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot2_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot3_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot3_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot4_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot4_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot5_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot5_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot6_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot6_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot7_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot7_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot8_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot8_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot9_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot9_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot10_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot10_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot11_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot11_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot12_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot12_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot13_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot13_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot14_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot14_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot15_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot15_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot16_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot16_RemoteUser=?=User) || \
   (Slot17_State=?="Claimed")&&(Slot17_RemoteUser=?=User) 

SLOT1_START = $(SLOT1_SLOT2_MATCH) && (JOB_Is_Monitor)
#SLOT2_START = &lt;your old START condition>
#START = ((SlotID == 1) && ($(SLOT1_START))) || \
#        ((SlotID == 2) && ($(SLOT2_START)))
START = ((SlotID == 1) && ($(SLOT1_START))) || \
        ((SlotID == 2) && ($(START)))

SLOT1_IsMonitorSlot = True
SLOT2_MyMonitorSlot = "slot1"
HAS_MONITOR_SLOT = True
STARTD_ATTRS = $(STARTD_ATTRS) IsMonitorSlot MyMonitorSlot HAS_MONITOR_SLOT
</pre>

---++ Use
You could then use this [[http://home.fnal.gov/~sfiligoi/condor_monitoring/job_monitor.tgz][example job monitoring tool]] extracted from [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/doc.prd/index.html][glideinWMS]] to submit jobs to the monitoring slot. The basic idea is to figure out where the job is running (by using condor_q) and then submit a job with the following constraints in its submit file:
<pre class="file">
+JOB_Is_Monitor=True
Requirements=(Name=?=”slot1@&lt;node running job>”)
</pre>

As Igor notes, t
The drawbacks of this method are:
   * It takes a negotiation cycle to get back results. Depending on your pool this could be a few seconds to minutes.
   * Cross slot information is only updated every few minutes, so it might take a few minutes after the job starts up before you can begin debugging it.
   * The number of slots in your pool increases (+1 per node or doubles depending on the choices).

One (untested) idea for how to speed things up a bit and avoid doubling the visible slots in the pool is to have the startds advertise to two central managers, one for normal jobs and one for monitoring jobs. (You can do that by simply listing both collectors in COLLECTOR_HOST.) You can use COLLECTOR_REQUIREMENTS to prune out all but the normal job execution slots in one collector and all but job monitoring slots in the other collector. A different idea is to have the job itself start up its own startd which joins a monitoring pool (private to the user?) and accepts monitoring jobs.
