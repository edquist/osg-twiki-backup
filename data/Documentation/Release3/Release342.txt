---+ OSG Software Release 3.4.2

*Release Date*: 2017-08-08

---++ Summary of changes

This release contains:
   * TBD
These [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.4.2%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20key%20DESC][JIRA tickets]] were addressed in this release.

%NOTE% OSG 3.4 contains only 64-bit components.
%NOTE% !StashCache is supported on EL7 only.
%NOTE% xrootd-lcmaps will remain at 1.2.1-2 on EL6.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues
   * Because the Gratia system has been turned off, RSV emits the following warning: =WARNING: Gratia server gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org:80 not responding to obtain last contact details.=. This warning can safely be ignored.
   * Using the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing "supported VO" RSV test ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2763][SOFTWARE-2763]]). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.
   * In !GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.
<pre class="file">
COLLECTOR.USE_SHARED_PORT=False

---++ Updating to the new release

To update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on [[Documentation/Release3/OSGReleaseSeries][updating between release series]]. 

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need to [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
