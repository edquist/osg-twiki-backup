---+ OSG Software Release 3.3.5

*Release Date*: 2015-11-19

---++ Summary of changes

This release contains:
   * TBD

These [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.3.5%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC][JIRA tickets]] were addressed in this release.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues
   * !CILogon CA certificate files have been reorganized between our various CA certificate packages.\
     To avoid file conflicts, you should upgrade your CA certificate RPMs at the same time, such as via the following command:\
     <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update '*-ca-cert*'</pre>
   * When using osg-configure to configure a CE host, it will fail because it tries to contact a !ReSS server that has been shut down permanently.  The !ReSS service has been deprecated since early 2014, and support for it will be removed from osg-configure in an upcoming version. To work around this osg-configure failure now, edit /etc/osg/config.d/30-infoservices.ini and set the option: \
<pre class="file">
ress_servers = https://localhost[RAW]
</pre>

   * There is a known memory leak in lcmaps-plugins-scas-client that HTCondor-CE triggers repeatedly. A special OSG release, coming soon, will fix the underlying memory leak, but in the meantime it is possible to make two small configuration changes to slow the rate at which memory leaks.
      1. In /etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-auth.conf, make sure the following attribute is defined as follows (note the $(USERS) at the end): \
<pre class="file">
COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_STARTD =  $(UNMAPPED_USERS), $(USERS)
</pre>
      1. Also in /etc/condor-ce/config.d/01-ce-auth.conf, add the following line to the end of the file: \
<pre class="file">
GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP_CACHE_EXPIRATION = 30*$(MINUTE)
</pre>
      1. Verify that the attributes are set properly by running the following command: \
<pre class="file">
$ condor_ce_config_val COLLECTOR.ALLOW_ADVERTISE_STARTD GSS_ASSIST_GRIDMAP_CACHE_EXPIRATION
*@unmapped.opensciencegrid.org, *@users.opensciencegrid.org
30*60
</pre>

   * HTCondor 8.4.0 has changed it's behavior in ways that cause the !GlideinWMS frontend configuration to break.  In order to correct this, the following setting needs to be added to the configuration file: \
<pre class="file">
COLLECTOR_USES_SHARED_PORT = False
</pre>
   * !StashCache packages need to be manually configured
      * Manual configuration for origin server
         * Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: \
<pre class="file">
xrd.port 1094
all.role server
all.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213
all.export / nostage
xrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect
ofs.trace none
xrd.trace conn
cms.trace all
sec.protocol  host
sec.protbind  * none
all.adminpath /var/run/xrootd
all.pidpath /var/run/xrootd
</pre>
      * Manual configuration for cache server
         * In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare =pss.origin <stash-redirector.example.com>= instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for !StashCache is [[https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/pages/viewpage.action?title=Installing+an+XRootD+server+for+Stash+Cache&spaceKey=STAS][here]].
      * In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from: \
<pre class="file">
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo"
</pre> \
to \
<pre class="file">
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo" 
</pre>

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
