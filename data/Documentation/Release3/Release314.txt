---+ OSG Software release 3.1.4

*Release Date*: 12-Jun-2012

---++ Summary of Changes

   * We have updated to the latest version (1.48) of the IGTF-accredited CA certificates. 
   * New Globus GRAM that fixes memory leak issues. [[http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-214][GT-214]]

All of the documentation can be found in [[Documentation.Release3][the "Release3"]] area of the Twiki. 

---++ Updating to the new release

If you have an existing installation, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or regex]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, rpm does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
