---++Globus Error: 3

---+++Syntax:

=Globus error 3: an I/O operation failed=

---+++Known causes:

Usually not related to an actual I/O failure.  More commonly, GRAM has run out of available memory.  Can also be generated by lack of disk/quota space, or permissions issues with the home directory.

---+++Recommendations:

Ask the grid admin to check/restart services using large amounts of memory and verify that your account has sufficient space to run the jobs you are trying to submit.
