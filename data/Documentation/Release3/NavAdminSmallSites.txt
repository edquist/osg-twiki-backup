   * link to planning documents for Tier3s
   * provide contact information to discuss Tier3's
   * explain what methods of authorization exists
   * link to information for various batch systems supported by the OSG
   * link to all essential installation documents

---++ About this document
This page collects a series of pointers that could be useful specially for sites that are not part of a bigger infrastructure or do not have already a clear plan on how to build the site.

This page is meant to complement the content of OSG Release 3 documentation, based on RPM packages. For a complete guide based on OSG 1.2 Pacman packages see the the [[Tier3.WebHome][Tier 3 documents]].

---++ Concepts
OSG systems (sites) typically provide one or more of the following capabilities:
   * access to local computational resources using a batch queue
   * interactive access to local computational resources
   * storage of large amounts of data using a distributed file system
   * access to external computing resources on the Campus or Production Grid
   * the ability to transfer large datasets to and from the Production Grid
  
A site can also offer computing resources and data to fellow grid users, e.g. on the OSG Production Grid.

In a OSG cluster, there are three classes of cluster nodes:
   1 Batch queue worker nodes that execute jobs submitted via the batch queue. 
   1 Shared Interactive nodes where users can log in directly and run their applications. 
   1 Nodes that serve various roles such as batch queues, file systems, or other middleware components. In some cases one node can host multiple roles while in other cases for a variety of reasons (including security or performance), nodes should be set aside for single purpose uses.

Important components (or roles) may include, depending on your configuration: a shared file system server (e.g. NFSv4), a Batch Queue (e.g. [[InstallCondor][Condor]]), a Distributed File System (e.g. [[XrootdOverview][Xroot]]), a [[NavAdminStorage][Storage Element (SE)]], a [[][Compute Element (CE) -- Provides the capability of sharing your local resources with fellow grid users. CMS Tier 3s typically install a CE while ATLAS Tier 3s typically do not install a CE for their smallest sites.

---++ Troubleshooting and getting help
The first line of support is primarily provided by [[HelpProcedure#VO_Assistance][the VO]] and/or local computing support personnel. 

In addition, OSG provides support via multiple channels including:
   * the [[HelpProcedure#Emergency_Assistance][24x7 GOC Emergency assistance]] for urgent matters
   * the [[SiteCoordination.ChatCalendar][Campfire Web chat]] for direct interactive support 
   * the [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open][GOC ticketing system]] to better track the case
   * its [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Consortium_Mailing_Lists][mailing lists]] for community support

Check HelpProcedure for a complete list of what is available, which channel is recommended for specific issues and  and where/how you can get help during the installation or maintenance of your site.
