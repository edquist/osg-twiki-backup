---++ Adding site specific attributes to GIP output that are not included in Glue schema
The GIP uses the Glue Schema to publish information about the site; however, the Glue Schema constraints GIP to only publish a fixed set of attributes.

The problem of adding custom information to our sites keeps arising under different circumstances. For example
   1 FNAL uses a grid to fabric requirement forwarding: how to set batch system constraints to submit jobs to a subcluster specified via grid requirements; 
   1 MPI parameters: how to give applications information about MPI library location, version, etc. 

Extending the Glue schema is an option, but the process is time consuming and requires coordination among various Grids. Without this coordination, OSG cannot extend this schema for its own purposes because it breaks interoperability with LCG.

Our solution to this problem is giving a mechanism for administrators to extend the schema published by GIP and filter out these extra attributes before they are published to BDII. This way, the schema available in BDII is still compliant with the Glue Schema and interoperability is maintained. At the same time, other information systems, such as ReSS, will be able to publish the extra custom attributes for the OSG users.

---+++ How do I get my GIP to publish non Glue Schema attributes?
 The procedure in this section is for adding new attributes to existing DNs. 
%NOTE% If you want to add a completely new DN, follow instructions in case 2 ("adding new DNs") in section "[[GipOverrides#Overwriting_attributes_published][Overwriting attributes published by GIP]]" below. 
   1 Add the extra attributes to alter-attributes.conf, as documented in the next step. The only restrictions on the newly added attributes are: 
      * The attribute should not start with the keyword 'Glue' 
      * It should not be called 'dn' 
      * It should not be called 'objectClass' 
   1 Set the value that you want to publish . This can be done in any of the following ways: 
      * Add an entry in the alter-attributes.conf file to change this value. (see how to do this in case 1 in section "[[GipOverrides#Overwriting_attributes_published][Overwriting attributes published by GIP]]" below). 
      * You can set static attribute value in the template file (step 1) 
      * Write a more full-fledged plugin, if the values you need to publish change dynamically. (GIP plugins and providers included in the GIP can be found in $VDT_LOCATION/gip/libexec/) 
   1 Run gip_info to see the GIP output. 

---++++!! An Example
 Let us say you want to advertise MPI attributes (!MPIInterconnect, !MPICompilerLocation, MPIVendor) that are associated with a particular subcluster. To accomplish this you would do the following 
   * Update /etc/gip/alter-attributes.conf to add the values associated with the cluster. <pre>dn: GlueSubClusterUniqueID=mysubcluster1.univ.edu, GlueClusterUniqueID=mycluster.univ.edu,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid<br />MPIVendor: MPICH<br />MPIInterconnect: Infiniband<br />MPICompilerLocation: /usr/local/mpi/mpi-compiler<br /><br />dn: GlueSubClusterUniqueID=mysubcluster2.univ.edu, GlueClusterUniqueID=mycluster.univ.edu,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid<br />MPIVendor: OpenMPI<br />MPIInterconnect: GigE<br />MPICompilerLocation: /sw/mpi/mpi-compiler </pre> 
   * The next GIP run will contain the newly added values.  Run gip_info to see the data immediately.
---++ Overwriting attributes published by GIP

GIP has two files that allow an administrator to set any ldif values for GIP reporting.  These are: =/etc/gip/alter-attributes.conf= and =/etc/gip/add-attributes.conf=. 

%IMPORTANT% If you want to alter or add multiple DNs, remember to have two new-line characters between the DNs.

%IMPORTANT% Each override entry has to begin with the line <br /> =dn: Glue...UniqueId=...,...= %BR% This line is crucial to identify where the information you are putting should go. This can be thought of as an hash key, telling GIP what exact attribute should be altered. ([[http://tille.garrels.be/training/ldap/ch01s03.html][More about the ldif format...]])

---++++!! Typical use-case for overwriting attributes

---+++++!! Case 1: Altering values published for attributes for existing DNs

This allows the site admin to alter the values that are being published.

Example 1: Changing the values associated with !GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP and !GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP . By default these attributes are initialized as follows:

<verbatim>
GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP: FALSE
GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP: TRUE 
</verbatim>

Let us say for example you want to specify that you Worker nodes don't have network access. This can be done as follows: 

Edit/Create =/etc/gip/alter-attributes.conf=, and add lines similar to the example below (You need to change 'grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu' to your sites 'FQDN' and the 'osg' in 'jobmanager-condor-osg' to the appropriate VO)

<verbatim>
dn: GlueSubClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu, GlueClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP: FALSE 
</verbatim>

Example 2: If you want to state that you have inbound access to your worker node, as well as change the Operating System value being published for this SubCluster. In this case you will again edit =/etc/gip/alter-attributes.conf= and add the lines as you see in the illustration below.

<verbatim>
dn: GlueSubClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu, GlueClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP: TRUE
GlueHostOperatingSystemName: My OS
GlueHostOperatingSystemRelease: MY OS RELEASE
GlueHostOperatingSystemVersion: MY-OS_V1 
</verbatim>

---+++++!! Case 2: Adding new DNs
 This gives site admin a mechanism to publish new information that are not being published by GIP. 

%NOTE% This is an addition to existing !DNs which are already being published.

Example: Let us say you already have one !SubCluster being published by !GIP and you would like to associate two more sub-clusters (with different architecture, !OS) within the same cluster. Let these be identified by unique IDs grow-subcluster1.its.uiowa.edu and grow-subcluster2.its.uiowa.edu, and let them be associated with the cluster grow-cluster.its.uiowa.edu. Then in order to publish these two new !SubClusters, we will add the following entries to the =/etc/gip/add-attributes.conf= file.

%IMPORTANT% It is important to get the !UniqueIDs correct since LDAP used them to form its directory structure

---+++!! Adding site defined constraints to custom configure condor status commands
 In GIP, it is now possible to add "--constraint" options to condor commands from GIP, to allow for custom configuration of GIP values. This constraint gets passed on to condor_status requests made by the GIP dynamic plugins. The use case for this came from BNL, where they had the nodes being shared between both the ITB and production cluster and they specify constraints in their condor class ads, as to how many nodes are available in each case. By default GIP dynamic plugins get the information about free and total cpus by executing a "condor_status" command without any parameter. So GIP was publishing incorrect information that could potentially affect !ReSS. In order to address this use case we added new options that can be added to the [CONDOR] section of the config.ini file. 

In order to enable this functionality (add administrator defined "--constraint" option to condor_status queries made by osg-info-dynamic-condor) add the following lines.

For a condor_status constraint:
<verbatim>
status_constraint = Your_constraint
</verbatim>

For a condor_q constraint:
<verbatim>
jobs_constraint = Your_constraint
</verbatim>

An example constraint
<verbatim>
jobs_constraint = CPU_Type == \"osgitb\"
</verbatim>
