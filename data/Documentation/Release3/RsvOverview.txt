---+!! Resource and Service Validation (!RSV) Service
%TOC%

---+ About this document
This is documentation for !RSV for !OSG 3.  !RSV documentation for OSG 1.0 and 1.2 is available [[MonitoringInformation/RSV][here]].

---+ RSV Description
---++ RSV Concepts
The Resource and Service Validation (!RSV) software provides a scalable and easy to maintain resource/service monitoring infrastructure for an OSG site admin. 
   * [[RsvPrinciples][RSV Principles]]
   * [[RsvArchitecture][RSV Architecture]]

---++ RSV Service Components
The components of !RSV are:
   * <strong>RSV Client:</strong> The client allows OSG site administrators to run tests against their CEs/SEs.  This provides a set of metrics to test the resource, Condor-Cron for scheduling,  and a Gratia infrastructure for collecting and storing the results.
      * The !RSV Client runs metrics at scheduled time intervals.  It produces a simple webpage of local !RSV results for a site administrator's viewing.  It also has the capability to upload those probe results to a central collector (addressed next).
   * <strong>RSV Collector/Server:</strong> The server collects results from any number of !RSV clients and stores them in a database. You can view these central results on [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/rgcurrentstatus/index?datasource=currentstatus&summary_attrs_showservice=on&summary_attrs_showrsvstatus=on&summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&downtime_attrs_showpast=&account_type=cumulative_hours&ce_account_type=gip_vo&se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&start_type=7daysago&start_date=12/25/2009&end_type=now&end_date=12/25/2009&all_resources=on&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on&service_central_value=0&service_hidden_value=0&active=on&active_value=1&disable_value=1][the !MyOSG-based !RSV current status page]].  Other !RSV-based choices are available in the <em>Resource Group menu</em> within !MyOSG.
   * <strong>Periodic Availability Reports:</strong> The availability of all active registered OSG resources and the services running on each of those resources is calculated using the results received for [[Operations.RsvEquivalency#Critical_Tests_for_OSG_Resources][critical metrics]]. Once a day, these availability numbers are <a href="http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports">published online</a> and via email [[MeasurementsAndMetrics.RsvReportsOverview][as explained here]].  (More information: [[Operations.RSVPeriodicReporting][Outline of reports]],     [[MeasurementsAndMetrics.RsvReports][Installation guide for GOC staff]]).
   * <strong>RSV-SAM Transport:</strong> The WLCG !RSV-SAM Transport infrastructure pushes out !RSV results (for resources that are flagged to be part of the WLCG Interoperability agreement) from the GOC collector to WLCG's Service Availability Monitoring (SAM) system. More information on [[Operations.RsvSAMGridView][viewing these results is available here]].
      * <strong>MyOSG and OIM Links: </strong> RSV picks up resource information, WLCG interoperability information, etc. from a !MyOSG resource group summary listing, which is in turn based on the [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OSG Information Management (OIM) (topology) system]] (Requires registration).  Resource [[Operations.OIMMaintTool][maintenance scheduled on OIM]], are forwarded to WLCG SAM, if applicable.
