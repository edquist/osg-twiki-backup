---++Globus Error: 73

---+++Syntax:

=GRAM Job submission failed because the job manager failed to open stdout (error 73)=

---+++Known cause:

The job tried to write stdout in a location it does not have permission to do so.

---+++Recommendation:

Make sure that stdout is directed to a directory in which a file can be created and written to.

---+++Known cause:

The remote job manager could not connect to the client.  This could be caused by a bad hostname (your hostname is not a fully qualified domain name) or a firewall blocking the traffic.

---+++Recommendations:

Be certain that your hostname is set correctly.

Example:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% globus-hostname
<fully qualified domain name>
</pre>

If it is not, add &lt;fully qualified domain name&gt; to /etc/hosts or:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% export $GLOBUS_HOSTNAME = <fully qualified domain name>
</pre>
