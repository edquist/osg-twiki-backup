---+!! Installing OSG Software to Use !OpenJDK 7

%TOC{depth="2"}%

---# About This Document

This document explains how to install Java-based OSG Software components in such a way that the only Java implementation installed and available afterward is !OpenJDK 7. The procedure is intended for site administrators who want to ensure that their systems are running only a current, supported Java implementation; specifically, it is part of the OSG plan to migrate away from all Java 6 implementations, which are no longer supported by their vendors.

The procedure below does *not* describe how to install or configure specific components. For that, please refer to the Release3/WebHome documentation index.

   * Local UCL_CWD  = /opt/osg-%VERSION%
   * Local UCL_HOST = host
-->

---# Applicable Versions (Optional)

Currently, only the Java-based software contained in the =osg-upcoming-testing= repositories have been tested with !OpenJDK 7. As the name indicates, the packages are still in public testing, so they are not suitable for production use at this time. See the [[SoftwareTeam.Java6Migration][Software team’s Java migration project page]] for more information about the overall project.

---# Background

Many OSG Software packages, including !BeStMan 2, Gratia, GUMS, HDFS, Pegasus, and VOMS Admin, contain Java code. Historically, we built and tested them using the Oracle JDK 1.6 implementation of Java 6. We even included the Oracle distributions in the OSG Software stack. However, Oracle officially discontinued public support for Java 6 at the end of February 2013, including security fixes. This is a problem for us due to the numerous security flaws in Java that people keep discovering. Therefore we must move away from Oracle JDK 1.6 and Java 6 in general. [[Java6Migration_draft][As announced earlier]], our plan has been to migrate all OSG Software Java components to work with !OpenJDK 7.

---# Requirements

To use !OpenJDK 7, the system must have or be able to install the =java-1.7.0-openjdk= package from the operating system vendor’s yum repository. This package is available on both EL5 and EL6 systems, although only the latest releases of EL5 systems contain it. Thus, you may need to upgrade your operating system to obtain !OpenJDK 7 for these instructions.

To see if your system has !OpenJDK 7 available:

   1. Install the =yum-utils= package, if not already installed (run =rpm -q yum-utils= to check)
   1. Check for the !OpenJDK 7 package:<pre class="screen">repoquery java-1.7.0-openjdk</pre>

The =repoquery= command should return at least one line of output, something like this:

<pre class="screen">java-1.7.0-openjdk-1:1.7.0.19-2.3.9.1.el5_9.x86_64</pre>

If it does not, then you probably need to update your operating system to the latest release, which is beyond the scope of this document.

---# Installation Procedure

The following installation instructions should work, regardless of the Java implementation(s) installed already. The complexity comes from dealing with all possible initial starting configurations.

---## Install the Java-Based Software

   1. Install Java-based software from the OSG Upcoming testing software repository<p>Follow the detailed installation instructions contained in the documents linked from the [[WebHome][documentation home page]].</p><p>For each =yum= command used, be sure to enable the Upcoming testing repository using the following =yum= command-line option:</p><pre class="rootscreen">... --enablerepo=osg-upcoming-testing ...</pre>

Installing any Java-based components from this repository will cause !OpenJDK 7 to be installed as well.

---## Purge the Java 1.6 Wrapper Package

   1. Check to see if the =java-1.6.0-sun-compat= package is installed:<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -q java-1.6.0-sun-compat</pre><p>If the RPM is installed, there will be a line of output containing the RPM name and version. *If not installed,* skip to the next section!</p>
   1. Remove the =java-1.6.0-sun-compat= package:<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum erase jdk java-1.6.0-sun-compat</pre>
   1. Make sure that !OpenJDK 7 is still installed correctly:<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum reinstall java-1.7.0-openjdk java-1.7.0-openjdk-devel</pre>
