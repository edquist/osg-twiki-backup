---+!! *OSG Application Software Installation Service (OASIS)*
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="2"}%


---++ Description
In order to effectively use the Open Science Grid (OSG) user jobs often require software that is too large or complicated to be sent along with the job. OASIS (OSG Application Software Installation Service) is a system that allows Virtual Organizations to install their software once, centrally, and have it visible and usable, via a distributed filesystem, from any OSG worker node.

OASIS consists of several components, along with specified procedures and practices, which together deliver the service. OASIS is currently built on CVMFS, a global distributed filesystem which provides secure, cacheable content served over HTTP. CVMFS handles the task of allowing content to be distributed, but it lacks the surrounding infrastructure to manage content installation and delivery safely, securely, and reliably. 

Repository (Stratum 0)
A standard CVMFS deployment includes a 'repository server' which contains the content and converts it to the format published globally. CVMFS provides simple tools for publishing content after it is added. This is the area where OASIS most provides value beyond basic CVMFS.  

OASIS provides the mechanisms for authenticating and authorizing write access to the server, in order to place and publish content. These mechanisms include direct GSISSH login and a job-oriented interface, controlled by user membership and roles in VOMS. Depending on the interface used, OASIS provides additional feedback to users and more informative logging for repository administrators. This is useful for troubleshooting and accounting. OASIS also encapsulates user actions to minimize the chance of accidental damage to new or existing content by aborting the publication process when errors occur.  

OASIS allows VOs and repository administrators to define and run arbitrary actions on content before publication, again providing feedback and logging. These probes can either validate the content however needed, or optionally take action on the content (e.g. adding nested catalogs, or deleting .svn directories).   

OASIS provides access to mechanisms allowing rollback of content, after publication, on a VO-by-VO basis. 

OASIS provides various VO-oriented administrative utilities for repo admins, e.g. to create or delete individual repositories, and to handle the key signing necessary for third-party repositories (i.e. run directly by the VO rather than OSG). 

Stratum 1
A Stratum 1 is a web server which exports published content, and is essentially Apache with an optional cache. OASIS adds utilities to manage exported content on a VO basis, providing the ability to block content that may be found to be invalid. 

Client
CVMFS makes content appear to be local to the worker node filesystem via a fuse-based client. OASIS adds configuration information pointing the client at the appropriate OSG distribution layer. It also may optionally include additional configuration mechanisms. 


Overall the purpose of OASIS is to 'productize' the CVMFS distributed filesystem to make it easy, safe, deployable, manageable, and secure.

The [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OASISServiceLevelAgreement][Service Level Agreement]] describes the agreement between OSG Operations and the OSG Management and Stakeholders related OASIS.


| * OASIS as a Service (!OaaS) * | it is the central OASIS service provided by GOC. One or more CVMFS  stratum-0s, stratum-1s, repositories... It can be generalized, and consider that any site running the same service at home can be called one !OaaS, being therefore the one at GOC just the central one.  | 
| * OASIS as a Repository (!OaaR) * | it is the actual CVMFS repo /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/  | 
| * OASIS as a Product (!OaaP) * | it is the actual code distributed via RPM that can be deployed by any one on top of their CVMFS service, including GOC. | 
| * OASIS as a Network (!OaaN) * | the set of CVMFS severs (and replicas) being somehow connected to this  project. Either because their keys are being signed by our keys, because we distribute the keys with a CVMFS repo served by !OaaS, because we replicate the content of external servers and add their content to the repos in the central !OaaS, etc. |

---++ Choices for the users

Every VO in OSG will be allowed to use the central OASIS service provided at the GOC, no matter the size of the content that VO wants to distribute, or how frequently new content is added.
The only limitations are those impossed by the underlying technology, CVMFS, as they are explained below.

-- OASIS 1: with the current version of the service, users log into an interactive host and blah blah. 
Instructions on how to update VO content using current OASIS 1 service are here: [[UpdateOasis][update VO content with OASIS 1]]


-- OASIS 2: when the new version of OASIS is available, together with interactive usage, users will also be allowed to submit their installation jobs with HTCondor.

 Even the central service is intented to satisfy all users need, sites deploying and maintaining their own repositories will be accepted.

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OasisExternalRepositories

 When ready, OASIS 2 code deployed at the GOC as a central service will also be available as an RPM for those sites who wants to use it on top of their bare CVMFS server installations, so a perfect copy of the architecture at the GOC can be reproduced at home.

Warning: [ explain here that we will block at our Stratum-1's those repos that create some damage ] https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OasisExternalRepositories#Emergency_procedure_to_blank_an
