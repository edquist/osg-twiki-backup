INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS OASIS


OASIS CHOICES FOR THE USERS

    Every VO in OSG will be allowed to use the central OASIS service provided at the GOC, no matter the size of the content that VO wants to distribute, or how frequently new content is added.
    The only limitations are those impossed by the underlying technology, CVMFS, as they are explained below.

    -- OASIS 1: with the current version of the service, users log into an interactive host and blah blah. [ maybe copy and paste here the UpdateOASIS page, or create a link to that page].
    https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/UpdateOasis

    -- OASIS 2: when the new version of OASIS is available, together with interactive usage, users will also be allowed to submit their installation jobs with HTCondor.
 
    Even the central service is intented to satisfy all users need, sites deploying and maintaining their own repositories will be accepted. 
    [ maybe copy and paste here the ExternalRepo page, or create a link to that page]    
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OasisExternalRepositories

    When ready, OASIS 2 code deployed at the GOC as a central service will also be available as an RPM for those sites who wants to use it on top of their bare CVMFS server installations, so a perfect copy of the architecture at the GOC can be reproduced at home. 
 
    Warning: [ explain here that we will block at our Stratum-1's those repos that create some damage ] https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/OasisExternalRepositories#Emergency_procedure_to_blank_an
