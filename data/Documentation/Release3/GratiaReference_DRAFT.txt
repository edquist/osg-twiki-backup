---++ About This Guide

---++ Cron
Probes are periodically run as cron jobs, but different probes will run at different intervals. The cron jobs will always run and you should not remove them. You can find them in =/etc/cron.d=.

However, the cron jobs will only do anything if you have enabled them. You enable them via an init script. For example, to enable them:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service gratia-probes-cron start
Enabling gratia probes cron:                               [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]
</pre>

To disable them:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service gratia-probes-cron stop
Disabling gratia probes cron:                               [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]
</pre>

You also need to enable individual probes, usually via =osg-configure=. See below for more information on that.

---++ Overall process of how Gratia probes work

By and large, the Gratia probes share this common process for uploading data to a Gratia server. 

---+++ Uploading data

When the cron jobs are enabled and run, the go through the following process, with minor changes between different Gratia probes:

   1. The probe is invoked. It reads its configuration from =/etc/gratia/%RED%PROBE-NAME%ENDCOLOR%/ProbeConfig=.
   1. It collects the accounting information from the underlying system. For example, the Condor probe will read it from the =PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR=, which is usually =/var/lib/gratia/data=.
   1. It transforms the data into Gratia records and saves them into =/var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles/=
   1. When there are sufficient Gratia records, or when sufficient time has passed, it uploads sets of records in batches to the Gratia server, then removes them from the =gratiafiles= directory.
   1. All progress is logged to =/var/log/gratia=.
   1. If there are failures in uploading the files to the Gratia server
      1. Files are not removed from =gratiafiles= until they are successfully uploaded.
      1. Errors are logged to log files in =/var/log/gratia=.
      1. The uploads will be tried again later.
      1. %RED% TO DO: In some cases, failed transfers get moved somewhere else. No details, [todo] ask Brian%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Identity Information
Job usage records collect the following information:
   * Local user - local (e.g. UNIX) user name
   * Local Group - local (e.g. UNIX) group name
   * Global user name 
   * VO name - Name of the virtual organization, as retrieved, e.g. FQDN string or "voi" string from =users-vo-mapfile=
   * Reportable VO name - Extracted name of the VO, e.g. the first name in the FQDN or "VOc" string from =users-vo-mapfile=
   * Common name (or Distinguished name, DN) - FQDN as present in the user certificate used for the job or as reconstructed form the VO

This information is retrieved via a series of functions, sometimes specific to a probe (e.g. the HTCondor probe), sometimes common to all probes (in =gratia-common=).
The mapping is affected by some configuration variables that affect which records are reported to Gratia, which are quarantined (stored in a directory for possible later processing) and which are discarded (without being reported to Gratia). These variables are (0, 1 correspond to false, true):
   * !SuppressNoDNRecords - discard records without a DN (in the final record - DNs in certinfo file are OK) [default: 0]
   * !SuppressGridLocalRecords - discard records from local users (users not coming via a Grid submission, e.g. GRAM or HTCondor-CE) [defaults: 0, was 1 for rel.<1.13.30]
   * !SuppressUnknownVORecords - discard records that have no VO [default: 0]
   * !QuarantineUnknownVORecords - quarantine records that have no VO [default: 0]
   * !MapUnknownToGroup - use the local user group (UNIX group name) as VO for records that have no VO otherwise established [default: 0]
   * !MapGroupToRole - add to the record DN "/LocalGroup=GROUP_NAME" using the local user group [default: 0]
   * !VOOverride - map all records to the specified VO (ignoring all other mappings) [default: NULL, no override]


---++ How the identity information is determined

The main information used to attribute resources used or provided is the VO, available in 2 record entries: VOName (can be a complex string indicating the VO affiliation, Similar to the VO extension of a FQDN), and !ReportableVOName (contains only the VO name, as one of the names in OIM).
The keyword "Unknown" (case insensitive) is not a valid VO name.

If !VOOverride in the probe configuration file is set to some value, then both !VOName and !ReportableVOName will be set to that value in all records reported.

Some probes can extract this information from the job record. E.g. the HTCondor probe (condor_meter) uses the classads !x509UserProxyFirstFQAN and !x509UserProxyVOName respectively for the !VOName and !ReportableVOName.

A Gratia extension of the job managers (in =globus-gram-job-manager-scripts= and =gratia-probe-gram=) generates files mapping the jobs (job IDs) to the user credentials. These files are called certinfo files, are saved in the Gratia data direcotry (=/var/lib/gratia/data=) and contain a vo_info record where the DN of the x509 certificate used to submit the job is mapped to a VO. This information is used if the initial !VOName is not available or not a valid VO name.

If also the certinfo file is not providing a valid VOName then the !JobIdentity record from from the HTCondor_CE is attempted. 

If also that one is not available (e.g. you are not on a HTCondor_CE), then the =user-vo-mapfile= is used.
This file contains lines mapping local (UNIX) users to VO names (VOName) and lines defining valid VO names (voi) and the corresponding !ReportableVOName (VOC).

If everything else fails and !MapUnknownToGroup is set in the configuration file, then the local user group name is used as VO name and !ReportableVOName. 

If !MapGroupToRole is set and there is not already a valid FQDN associated with the job record, then the VOName is modified assigning a Local group part like: =="%s/LocalGroup=%s" % (vo_name, local_group_name)==
