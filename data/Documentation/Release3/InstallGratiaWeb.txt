---+!! Install Gratia Web from OSG repository

%GRAY%
   * Gratia Web installation guide
%ENDCOLOR%

%TOC{depth="2"}%


---+ About this Document
Here we describe how to install and configure the Gratia-Web server. Gratia Web is a web server that provides accounting information collected in the Gratia Databases.


---+ Requirements
---++ Host and OS
   * A host to install the Gratia Web server.
   * OS is %SUPPORTED_OS%. 
   * OS must have EPEL and OSG yum repositories configured (see installati
   * Root access.

---++ Networking
%STARTSECTION{"Firewalls"}%
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation" section="FirewallTable"}% \
| HTTP |  tcp  |  8100 |  %ICON{choice-yes}%  | | Default http port for the Gratia Web server |
%ENDSECTION{"Firewalls"}%
%NOTE% The Networking table should be defined in as section starting with <verbatim> %STARTSECTION{"Firewalls"}% </verbatim> so that they all can be sourced and collected together by the Firewall document.

---## Additional Requirements
Can be added if needed, e.g. for testing requirements:
   * Access to your own certificate if you want to create your voms proxy
   * Your certificate uploaded into a browser if you want to test the WEB UI

---# Installation Procedure

%GRAY%
This section should contain the entire installation procedure. The configuration of the software should be contained in an own subsection (see below) if it requires a significant amount of work and cannot easily be included in the installation procedure presented here.  There are includes for information on repositories and installing certificates as shown below.
%ENDCOLOR%

%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefCaCerts" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%


%GRAY%
%NOTE% This procedure covers the success legs only. Everything else should be included in the 'Troubleshooting' section at the bottom! 
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;1st Step of the Installation Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Each subsection might start with a brief explanation what the goal of the subsection is.
%ENDCOLOR%

%GRAY%
Each step that involves a terminal display should show the commands in a green box for a user terminal and a red box for the root terminal using:

<verbatim><pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <command> <parameters>
<output>
</pre></verbatim> 

tag which will look like this for a user terminal.
%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% command parameters
output
</pre>

%GRAY%
%NOTE% Output that is longer than a few lines should be wrapped into the [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Command_Line_and_Output][output twisty]].

Standard variables (such as =OSG_VERSION=) should be used where they exist. The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command line _after_ the prompt!

Please consult the [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Presenting_the_Unix_Command_Line][formating rules for the command line]] for more detailed information.

---## &lt;2nd Step of the Installation Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Everything above said about the 1st step applies to this section.
%ENDCOLOR%


---# Configuration Procedure (Optional)

%GRAY%
Non-trivial configuration steps for the software should be presented here. Include an overview of the configuration procedure if the procedure itself is lengthy:
%ENDCOLOR%

In the next step we will configure the service using following steps:

   1 edit this file
   1 open that firewall port
   1 ...

%GRAY%
Steps listed as part of the numbered list above should have their own sub-section inside this section. For example:
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;1st Step of the Configuration Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
The procedure may require the reader to edit configuration files. We will use a CSS class named _file_ to render a yellow box around the content ( or parts of it ) of the file:

<verbatim><pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre></verbatim>

%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

%GRAY%
%NOTE% For more information [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Presenting_File_Content][see here]].
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;2nd Step of the Configuration Procedure&gt;

%GRAY%
Everything said about the 1st step applies to this and every following step.
%ENDCOLOR%


---# Services 
%NOTE% This is a partial example to show what is included and the formatting.  
Services brief description

---## Starting and Enabling Services
%STARTSECTION{"StartVOMSServices"}%
To start VOMS you need to start several services:
   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStart"}%
   1. Start voms server<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service voms start
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"StartVOMSServices"}%

You should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on: 
   * %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlEnable"}%
   * To enable the other services: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig voms on
</pre>

---## Stopping and Disabling Services
%STARTSECTION{"StopVOMSServices"}%
To stop VOMS you need to stop voms,... , and also the services they use if nothing else is using them:
   1. Stop voms server<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service voms stop
</pre>
   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStop"}%
%ENDSECTION{"StopVOMSServices"}%

In addition, you can disable services by running the following commands.  However, you don't need to do this normally.
   * %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlDisable"}%
   * To disable the other services: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig voms off
</pre>

---# Validation of Service Operation (Optional)

%GRAY%
Occasionally the steps to validate the success and correct operation of an installation may be _non-trivial_. Please use this _optional_ section to describe how the user can verify the success of the installation.

%NOTE% This section should not become a user guide! Please link to the applicable sections of the user documentation if the service validation requires the reader to execute a user command.
%ENDCOLOR%

---# Troubleshooting
%GRAY%
Please include this section if you can provide useful troubleshooting information here. Use sub sections for each topic you want to address.  Include file locations in a table as shown.
%ENDCOLOR%

---## Useful Configuration and Log Files
In the troubleshooting section of each Install Document, the file locations should be specified as follows:
| *Service/Process* | *Configuration File* | *Description* |
| Service1 | /etc/Service1.cfg | Configuration information for this service |
| Service2 | /etc/Service2.cfg | Configuration information for this service |

| *Service/Process* | *Log File* | *Description* |
| Service1 | /var/log/service.log | Records all service errors |
| | /var/log/service1b.log | Records all service updates |
| Service2 | /var/log/service2.log | Records all service errors |

---# Known Issues

%GRAY%
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues. 
%ENDCOLOR%

---## &lt;How can I resolve this Problem?&gt;

%GRAY%
Use sub-sections for each problem you want to address in particular. Link to ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure at the end if the problem could not be resolved.
%ENDCOLOR%

---# Get Help/Support
To get assistance please use [[Documentation/Release3.HelpProcedure][this page]]. 


---# References (Optional)

%GRAY%
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants more background or information. Link related material here, such as the user guide to the software the user was just installing.
