---+!! Testing new !RSV probes

This page contains information for how !RSV probe developers can test their new probes into the RSV framework.

This page assumes you've already [[WriteProbe][written]] and [[InstallProbe][installed]] an !RSV probe.  See [[WriteYourOwnRSVProbe][the overall process info]].

---++ Testing the !RSV probe

Try your new metric out using the rsv-control tool.

<pre class="screen">
rsv-control --run --host <em>foo.example.com</em> <em>org.osg.your.metric</em>
</pre>

---+++ Common problems

---++++ ERROR: Metric does not exist at /opt/itb/osg-rsv/bin/metrics/org.osg.your.metric

This means that you have not created a symlink in the =VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/metrics= directory.  Create a symlink named after your metric in this directory.  It should point at your probe.  See the other symlinks in this directory for an example.

---++++ ERROR: Mandatory config file '/opt/itb/osg-rsv/meta/metrics/org.osg.your.metric.meta' does not exist

You need to create a meta file at the location specified.

---++++ ERROR: Metric configuration is missing 'service-type' or 'execute' declaration

You did not specify either 'service-type' or 'execute' in the meta file.  See the [[InstallProbe][install probe section]] for info on this.
