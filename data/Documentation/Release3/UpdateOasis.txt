---+!! Updating Software on OASIS

%TOC%


The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version 3.1.13* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher)

---++ About OASIS
OASIS is the OSG Application Software Installation Service.  It is the recommended method to install software on the Open Science Grid.  It is implemented using !CernVM !FileSystem (CVMFS) technology.

---++ About this Document
This document is a step by step explanation of how a Virtual Organization (VO) Software Adminstrator can enable the OASIS service and use it to publish and update software on OSG Worker Nodes.  For information on how to configure a client for OASIS see the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallCvmfs][OSG CVMFS Installation documentation]].

---++ Requirements
To begin the process to distribute software on OASIS, you must:
   * have a personal certificate. The process for getting one is detailed [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/CertificateUserGet][here]].
   * register that certificate in [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/home][OIM]].  In order to register, the certificate has to be [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGetWeb#Installing_into_a_Web_Browser][installed in your browser]].  If you are then not registered, clicking "Login" on the page will prompt you to register.
   * be associated with a VO that is registered in OIM. The list of registered VOs appears [[http://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/vo][here]].
   * register your certificate in the VOMS for your VO.  Click on the VO name that you're associated with in the above list and from there select the "Membership Services URL" to register with VOMS.

---++ Technical details
---+++ Enable OASIS
When you are ready to distribute your software with OASIS, submit a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][GOC ticket]] with a request to enable OASIS for your VO. In your request, please specify your VO and provide a list of people who will install and administer the VO software in OASIS. 

The GOC will enable OASIS for your VO in [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/home][OIM]] and add your list of administrators to the "OASIS Managers" list (which is near the bottom of the page of information about each VO in OIM).  oasis-login will then grant access to the people who are listed as OASIS managers.  Any time the list is to be modified, submit another GOC ticket.

---+++ Log in with GSISSH
The next step is to generate a proxy and log into =oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org= with =gsissh=.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%VO%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% gsissh oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org
</pre>

---+++ Updating and installing software
Once you log in, content is added/modified/removed on a staging area at =/net/nas01/Public/ouser.$VO= where $VO is the name of the VO represented by the manager.

Files here are visible to both =oasis-login= and the Stratum 0 server (oasis.opensciencegrid.org)

The OASIS manager for the VO requests an oasis update with: 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% osg-oasis-update
</pre>

It is required that the requester be logged into the account associated
with a supported VO. As of this writing, these are:
   * ouser.csiu
   * ouser.fermilab
   * ouser.gm2
   * ouser.hcc
   * ouser.icecube
   * ouser.mis
   * ouser.nova
   * ouser.osg
   * ouser.sbgrid
   * ouser.uc3

Others may be added per request.
Any other account generates a message and the update request fails.

Only one instance of =osg-oasis-update= can run at a time (across all VOs); your request may be queued behind a different VO.  If you encounter severe delays (more than 4 hours), please file a GOC ticket.

---+++ Details of =osg-oasis-update= operation.

A test is performed to determine if an update is in progress (existence
of a lock file, discussed below). If an update is in progress a "Please
try again later" message is printed and the process exits.

If no lock file exists one (vo_update_requested) is written. 

A request to update the stratum 0 generated.

The stratum 0 update is run as root and started by a crontab entry running
once per minute. The cron job detects the lockfile (vo_update_requested) written by the request
process on oasis-login.
If another lock (oasis_update_in_progress)
exists, the process sleeps and loops until it does not. This
mechanism prevents more than one update to be in progress at any time.
If oasis_update_in_progress does not exist it is created and the update process continues.
The files previously placed on the shared filesystem are rsync'ed to the 
/cvmfs directory. Upon completion a cvmfs-sync and cvmfs_server publish
are executed. All lock files are removed upon completion.

Finally, the status of the service is updated. See
http://oasis.opensciencegrid.org/stamp
A publish_age of zero indicates success. 

These mechanisms insure that:

   1. Only the OASIS manager for a VO can write to a location serving as the source of updates
   1. After a request is made only the files associated with one VO are updated
   1. Only one update can be in progress at a time
