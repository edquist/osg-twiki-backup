---++ !RSV Developer Guide

This is a guide for developers who are creating new !RSV metrics or who are maintaining existing RSV metrics. 

---+++ Overview

!RSV is an infrastructure we use in Open Science Grid for monitoring the grid-aspects of !OSG. For example, we use it to verify that a site is correctly accepting jobs to run, but we don't use it to monitor the fan speed on computers in your cluster. 

The !RSV software is broken into three portions:

   1. *RSV Core* <br>The !RSV core is the underlying infrastructure that is used to run the set of metrics (tests) performed by !RSV.  This includes Condor-Cron and the =rsv-control= tool.
   1. *RSV Metrics* <br> The !RSV metrics are the set of tests that !RSV performs. 
   1. *RSV Consumers* <br>The !RSV consumers publish the results of the metrics.  Examples are the =html-consumer= which creates a local web page for site administrators to view, and the =gratia-consumer= which uploads records to the GOC.

You are most likely to be concerned with adding or maintaining some of the !RSV metrics.

---+++ Your responsibilities as a metric developer

   * You will write and/or maintain the metric.
   * You will inform the !VDT and OSG Software Tools Group if you no longer have the effort to maintain your metrics.
   * You will test your metric before you declare it ready for release. 
   * When the !VDT team is unable to answer questions or provide support about your !RSV metric, we'll ask you for help to do the support. 

---+++ The VDT's responsibilities as the !RSV maintainer

   * The VDT maintains the source code repository for !RSV, and provides access to it. (We use Subversion.)
   * If you need access to computers on which to test your probes, the VDT will give you access to it's test cluster.
   * The VDT will coordinate the release process with the VTB and ITB.
   * The VDT will release new versions of !RSV. 
   * The VDT will be the first line of support for !RSV--the core and metrics
