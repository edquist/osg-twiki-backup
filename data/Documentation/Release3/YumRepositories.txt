---+ About This Document
This document introduces YUM repositories and how OSG uses them.

---+ Repositories
OSG hosts four public-facing repositories at [[http://repo.grid.iu.edu/][repo.grid.iu.edu]]:
   * *development*: This repository is the bleeding edge.  Installing from this repository may cause the host to stop functioning, and we will not assist in undoing any damage.
   * *testing*: This repository contains software ready for testing.  If you install packages from here, they may be buggy, but we will provide limited assistance in providing a migration path to a fixed version.
   * *release*: This repository contains software that we are willing to support and can be used by the general community.
   * *contrib*: RPMs contributed from outside the OSG.  

OSG's RPM packages rely also on external packages provided by supported OSes and EPEL. Supported repositories include:
   * SL 5 and 6 repositories
   * !CentOS 5 and 6 repositories
   * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 repositories
   * EPEL 5 & 6

You must have enabled:
   * your OS repositories
   * EPEL
   * the OSG repositories you'd like to use

If one of these repositories is missing you may have missing dependencies.

%WARNING% We did not test other repositories. If you use packages from other repositories, like =jpackage=, you may encounter problems.

---+ Enabling repositories
In [[Documentation/Release3.InstallBestPractices][our advice on using yum]] you will learn many tricks and tips on using yum.

To use the packages in a repository without adding special options to the yum command the repository must be enabled.

%STARTSECTION{"OSGRepoBrief"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Install the Yum Repositories required by OSG
The OSG RPMs currently support %SUPPORTED_OS%.

OSG RPMs are distributed via the OSG yum repositories. Some packages depend on packages distributed via the [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][EPEL]] repositories. So both repositories must be enabled.
---++ Install EPEL
   * Install the EPEL repository, if not already present. *Note:* This enables EPEL by default. Choose the right version to match your OS version. <pre class="rootscreen">
%RED%# EPEL 5 (For RHEL 5, CnentOS 5, and SL5) %ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
%RED%# EPEL 6 (For RHEL 6, CentOS 6, and SL6) %ENDCOLOR% 
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm</pre>
       *WARNING*: if you have your own mirror or configuration of the EPEL repository, you *MUST* verify that the OSG repository has a better yum priority than EPEL ([[Documentation.Release3.InstallBestPractices#YumPriorities][details]]). Otherwise, you will have strange dependency resolution (_depsolving_) issues.%BR%
---++ Install yum-priorities
   1. Install the =yum-priorities= plugin <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install yum-priorities</pre>
   1. Ensure that =/etc/yum.conf= has the following line in the =[main]= section (particularly when using ROCKS). This enables yum plugins<pre class="file">
plugins=1</pre>
       *NOTE*: If you don't have a required key you can force the installation using =--nogpgcheck=, e.g. =yum install --nogpgcheck yum-priorities=.%BR%
---++ Install OSG Repositories
   1. <p>First, determine which OSG series you will be installing; 3.1 or 3.2.  The OSG 3.1 and 3.2 series are each well tested and contain the entire OSG software stack.  The 3.1 series continues to support all packages that have been released throughout its lifetime, while the 3.2 series contains newer versions of software (including HTCondor, Hadoop, glideinWMS) and removes support for obsolete packages (including CEMonitor).  Initially, most packages are identical between 3.1 and 3.2, but we expect the new series to diverge over time.</p>
   1. If you are upgrading from 3.1 to 3.2, first remove the 3.1 repository:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -e osg-release</pre>
   This step ensures that any local modifications to =*.repo= files will not prevent installing the new 3.2 repos.  Any modified =*.repo= files should appear under =/etc/yum.repos.d/= with the =*.rpmsave= extension.  After installing the new OSG repositories (the next step) you may want to apply any changes made in the =*.rpmsave= files to the new =*.repo= files.
   1. <p>Install the OSG repositories:</p>\
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh %RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%</pre>\
    <p>Where =%RED%URL%ENDCOLOR%= is one of the following:</p>

| *Series* | *EL5 URL (for RHEL5, !CentOS5, or SL5)* | *EL6 URL (for RHEL6, !CentOS6, or SL6)* |
| *OSG 3.1* | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/osg-3.1-el6-release-latest.rpm= |
| *OSG 3.2* | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm= | =http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm= |

%IF{"$ TOPIC != 'YumRepositories'" then="For more details, please see our [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories][yum repository documentation]]." else=""}%

---+ Priorities

%NOTE% Make sure you installed the yum-priorities plugin, as described above. Not doing so is a common mistake that causes failed installations.

The only OSG repository enabled by default is the release one. If you want to enable another one, e.g. osg-testing, then edit its file (e.g. =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-testing.repo=) and change the enabled option from 0 to 1: <pre class="file">
[osg-testing]
name=OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - Testing - $basearch
#baseurl=http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.1/el5/testing/$basearch
mirrorlist=http://repo.grid.iu.edu/mirror/osg/3.1/el5/testing/$basearch
failovermethod=priority
priority=98
enabled=%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG
</pre>

%WARNING% if you have your own mirror or configuration of the EPEL repository, you *MUST* verify that the OSG repository has a better yum priority than EPEL.  Otherwise, you will have strange dependency resolution issues.%BR%
