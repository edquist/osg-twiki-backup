---+ About This Document
This document introduces YUM repositories and how OSG uses them.

---+ Repositories
OSG hosts four public-facing repositories at [[http://repo.grid.iu.edu/][repo.grid.iu.edu]]:
   * *development*: This repository is the bleeding edge.  Installing from this repository may cause the host to stop functioning, and we will not assist in undoing any damage.
   * *testing*: This repository contains software ready for testing.  If you install packages from here, they may be buggy, but we will provide limited assistance in providing a migration path to a fixed version.
   * *release*: This repository contains software that we are willing to support and can be used by the general community.
   * *contrib*: RPMs contributed from outside the OSG.  

OSG's RPM packages rely also on external packages provided by supported OSes and EPEL. Supported repositories include:
   * SL 5 repositories
   * !CentOS 5 repositories
   * EPEL

You must have enabled:
   * your OS repositories
   * EPEL
   * the OSG repositories you'd like to use

If one of these repositories is missing you may have missing dependencies.

%WARNING% We did not test other repositories. If you use packages from other repositories, like =jpackage=, you may encounter problems.

---+ Enabling repositories
In [[Documentation/Release3.InstallBestPractices][our advice on using yum]] you will learn many tricks and tips on using yum.

To use the packages in a repository without adding special options to the yum command the repository must be enabled.

%STARTSECTION{"OSGRepoBrief"}%
---%SHIFT%+ Install the Yum Repositories required by OSG
The OSG RPMs currently support %SUPPORTED_OS%. Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 5; we expect it will work well on !CentOS 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but please let us know of any problems.

OSG RPMs are distributed via the OSG yum repositories. Some packages depend on packages distributed via the [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][EPEL]] repositories. So both repositories must be enabled.
   1. If not already present, install EPEL. *Note:* This enables EPEL by default. <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm</pre>
   1. Install the =yum-priorities= plugin <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install yum-priorities</pre>
   1. Ensure that =/etc/yum.conf= has the following line in the =[main]= section (particularly when using ROCKS). This enables yum plugins<pre class="file">
plugins=1</pre>
   1. Install the OSG repositories: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-release-latest.rpm</pre>
       *WARNING*: if you have your own mirror or configuration of the EPEL repository, you *MUST* verify that the OSG repository has a better yum priority than EPEL ([[Documentation.Release3.InstallBestPractices#YumPriorities][details]]). Otherwise, you will have strange dependency resolution (_depsolving_) issues.%BR%
       *NOTE*: If you don't have a required key you can force the installation using =--nogpgcheck=, e.g. =yum install --nogpgcheck yum-priorities=.%BR%

---+ Priorities

%NOTE% Make sure you installed the yum-priorities plugin, as described above. Not doing is is a common mistakes that causes failed installations.

The only OSG repository enabled by default is the release one. If you want to enable another one, e.g. osg-testing, then edit its file (e.g. =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-testing.repo=) and change the enabled option from 0 to 1: <pre class="file">
[osg-testing]
name=OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - Testing - $basearch 
baseurl=http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/repos/3.0/el5//testing/$basearch
failovermethod=priority
priority=98
enabled=%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-OSG
</pre>

%WARNING% if you have your own mirror or configuration of the EPEL repository, you *MUST* verify that the OSG repository has a better yum priority than EPEL.  Otherwise, you will have strange dependency resolution issues.%BR%
