---++ About This Document
This document introduces YUM repositories and how OSG uses them.

---++ Repositories
OSG hosts four public-facing repositories at [[http://repo.grid.iu.edu/][repo.grid.iu.edu]]:
   * *development*: This repository is the bleeding edge.  Installing from this repository may cause the host to stop functioning, and we will not assist in undoing any damage.
   * *testing*: This repository contains software ready for testing.  If you install packages from here, they may be buggy, but we will provide limited assistance in providing a migration path to a fixed version.
   * *release*: This repository contains software that we are willing to support and can be used by the general community.
   * *contrib*: RPMs contributed from outside the OSG.  

OSG's RPM packages rely also on external packages provided by supported OSes and EPEL. Supported repositories include:
   * SL 5 repositories
   * !CentOS 5 repositories
   * EPEL

You must have enabled:
   * your OS repositories
   * EPEL
   * the OSG repositories you'd like to use

If one of these repositories is missing you may have missing dependencies.

%WARNING% We did not test other repositories. If you use packages from other repositories, like =jpackage=, you may encounter problems.

---++ Enabling repositories
In YumAdvice you may find some advice on using yum.

To use the packages in a repository without adding special options to the yum command the repository must be enabled.

---+++ Installing and enabling EPEL
If EPEL is not installed you can download and install it: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -i epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm </pre>

The RPM installation enables EPEL by default.

---+++ Installing and enabling the OSG repositories
Install the OSG repositories: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -Uvh http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-release-latest.rpm</pre>

The only OSG repository enabled by default is the release one. If you want to enable another one, e.g. osg-testing, then edit its file (e.g. =/etc/yum.repos.d/osg-testing.repo=) and change the enabled option from 0 to 1: <pre class="file">
[osg-testing]
name=OSG Software for Enterprise Linux 5 - Testing - $basearch 
baseurl=http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/repos/3.0/el5//testing/$basearch
failovermethod=priority
priority=98
enabled=%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%
#gpgcheck=1
#gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL
</pre>

*WARNING*: if you have your own mirror or configuration of the EPEL repository, you *MUST* verify that the OSG repository has a better yum priority than EPEL.  Otherwise, you will have strange depsolving issues.%BR%
