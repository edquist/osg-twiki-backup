---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document outlines the settings and options found in the ini files for system administers that are installing and configuring osg software.

This page gives an overview of the options for each of the sections of the configuration files that =osg-configure= uses. 

---++ Conventions 

In the tables below:
   * Mandatory options for a section are given in *bold* type. Sometime the default value may be OK and no edit required, but the variable has to be in the file. 
   * Options that are not found in the default ini file are in _italics_.

---+ Introduction
=osg-configure= and the INI files in =/etc/osg/config.d= allow a higl level configuration of OSG services. 

%STARTSECTION{"Layout"}%
---+%SHIFT% Layout
The configuration files used by =osg-configure= are the one supported by Python's [[http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html][SafeConfigParser]], similar in format to the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file][INI configuration file]] used by MS Windows.  Long lines can be split up using continuations as specified in [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822.html][email RFC 822]] (each White Space Character can be preceded by a Newline to fold/continue the fileld on a new line).  A config file is separated into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. =[Section 1]=) .  Lines that begin with a =;= or a =#= are treated as comments and ignored.  Options can be set using either =name : value= or =name=value= pairs.  Finally, variables and variable substitutions are supported.

=osg-configure= reads and uses all of the files in =/etc/osg/config.d= that have a "ini" suffix.  The files in this directory are ordered with a numeric prefix with higher numbers being applied later and thus having higher precedence (e.g. 00-foo.ini has a lower precedence than 99-local-site-settings.ini).  Configuration sections and options can be specified multiple times in different files. E.g. a section called [PBS] can be given in =20-pbs.ini= as well as =99-local-site-settings.ini=.

Each of the files are successively read and merged to create a final configuration that is then used to configure OSG software.  Options and settings in files read later override the ones in previous files.  This allows admins to create a file with local settings (e.g. =99-local-site-settings.ini=) that can be read last and which will be take precedence over the default settings in configuration files installed by various RPMs and which will not be overwritten if RPMs are updated.
%ENDSECTION{"Layout"}%


%STARTSECTION{"Variables"}%
---+%SHIFT% Variables and variable substitution
The osg-configure parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file.  Any option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Note, this means that you will need to be careful when naming variables in order to avoid an infinite loop when resolving the variable substitution.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name =myoption= in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as =%(myoption)s= .  Please note that the trailing =s= is required.  Also the variable substitution will only occur when setting an option, so option names can not have a variable substitution in them.

%ENDSECTION{"Variables"}%

---+ Options and settings
If a setting is set to UNAVAILABLE or DEFAULT or left blank, osg-configure will try to use a sensible default for setting if possible. 

---++ Ignore setting
The =enabled= option, specifying whether a service is enabled or not, is a boolean but also accepts =Ignore= as a possible value.  Using Ignore, results in the service associated with the section being ignored entirely (and any configuration is skipped).  This differs from using =False= (or the =%(disabled)s= variable), because using =False= results in the service associated with the section being disabled.  =osg-configure= will not change the configuration of the service  if the =enabled= is set to =Ignore=.  

This is useful, if you have a complex configuration for a given that can't be set up using the ini configuration files.  You can manually configure that service by hand editing config files, manually start/stop the service and then use the =Ignore= setting so that =osg-configure= does not alter the service's configuration and status.

---+ Configuration sections
The OSG configuration is divided into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. =[Section 1]=). The configuration is split in multiple files and options form one section can be in more than one files.

The following sections give an overview of the options for each of the sections of the configuration files that =osg-configure= uses. 

%STARTSECTION{"SiteInformation"}%
---++ Site Information

The settings found in the =Site Information= section are described below.  This section is used to give information about a resource such as resource name, site sponsors, administrators, etc.  In the default installation, this section is found in =/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini= .

| Option | Values Accepted | Description |
| *group* | =OSG= , =OSG-ITB= | This should be set to either OSG or OSG-ITB depending on whether your resource is in the OSG or OSG-ITB group.  Most sites should specify OSG |
| *host_name* | String | This should be set to be hostname of the CE that is being configured |
| *resource* | String | The resource name of this CE endpoint as registered in OIM.  |
| *resource_group* | String | The resource_group of this CE as registered in OIM.   |
| *sponsor* | String | This should be set to the sponsor of the resource, if your resource has multiple sponsors, you can separate them using commas or specify the  percentage using the following format 'osg, atlas, cms' or 'osg:10, atlas:45, cms:45'. The percentages must add up to 100 if multiple sponsors are used.  If you have a sponsor that is not an OSG VO, you can indicate this by using local as the VO.    |
| *site_policy* | Url | This should be a url pointing to the resource's usage policy |
| *contact* | String | This should be the name of the resource's admin contact |
| *email* | Email address | This should be the email address of the admin contact for the resource |
| *city* | String | This should be the city that the resource is located in |
| *country* | String | This should be two letter country code for the country that the resource is located in.  |
| *longitude* | Number | This should be the longitude of the resource. It should be a number between -180 and 180. |
| *latitude* | Number| This should be the latitude of the resource. It should be a number between -90 and 90. |

Can be defined in terms of an environment variable (e.g. =$FOO=) that will be evaluated on the worker node. If it is not installed, set this to =UNAVAILABLE=. glExec does not work with the =vomsmap= authorization method on OSG 3.3 and *is entirely unsupported starting in OSG 3.4* |
| *gums_host* | String | This setting is used to indicate the hostname of the GUMS host that should be used for authentication, if the authorization method below is set to =xacml=.  If GUMS is not used, this should be set to =UNAVAILABLE=. *GUMS is deprecated in OSG 3.4* |
| *authorization_method* | =gridmap=, =xacml=, =local-gridmap=, =vomsmap= | This indicates which authorization method your site uses. ==xacml== *is deprecated in OSG 3.4* |

| *gratia_probes* | String | This settings indicates which rsv gratia probes should be used.  It is a list of probes separated by a comma.  Valid probes are metric, condor, pbs, lsf, sge, managedfork, hadoop-transfer, and gridftp-transfer |
| ce_hosts | String | This option lists the serviceURI of the CEs that generic RSV CE probes should check.  This should be a list of serviceURIs (hostname[:port/service]) separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3:2812). This must be set if enable_ce_probes is set. If this is left blank or set to =UNAVAILABLE=, the CE's hostname is used by default. | 
| gram_ce_hosts | String | This option lists the serviceURI of the Globus GRAM-based CEs that the RSV GRAM CE probes should check. This should be a list of serviceURIs (hostname[:port/service]) separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3:2812). This should be set if gram_gateway_enabled in the Gateway configuration section is True. *GRAM is unsupported starting in OSG 3.4* |
| htcondor_ce_hosts | String | This option lists the serviceURI of the HTCondor-CE-based CEs that the RSV HTCondor-CE probes should check. This should be a list of serviceURIs (hostname[:port/service]) separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3:2812).

---++ Gateway

This section gives information about the options in the Gateway section of the configuration files.
These options control the behavior of job gateways on the CE.
Most CEs are based on HTCondor-CE, which uses =condor-ce= as the gateway.
Some older CEs may be based on Globus GRAM, which uses =globus-gatekeeper= as the gateway, but GRAM is no longer supported starting in OSG 3.4.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *gram_gateway_enabled* | =True=, =False= | (default False; *unavailable starting in OSG 3.4*). True if the CE is using Globus GRAM, False otherwise. GRAM Job managers will be configured for enabled batch systems. RSV will use GRAM to launch remote probes. |
| *htcondor_gateway_enabled* | =True=, =False= | (default True). True if the CE is using HTCondor-CE, False otherwise. HTCondor-CE will be configured to support enabled batch systems. RSV will use HTCondor-CE to launch remote probes. |
| *job_envvar_path* | String | The value of the PATH environment variable to put into HTCondor jobs running with HTCondor-CE. This value is ignored if not using that batch system/gateway combination. |

| *grid_dir* | String | The grid_dir setting should point to the directory which holds the files from the OSG worker node package. If you have installed the worker node client via RPM (the normal case) it should be =/etc/osg/wn-client=. If you have somehow installed the worker node in a special location (perhaps via the worker node client tarball or via OASIS), it should be the location of that directory. This directory should be visible on all of the computer nodes and will be accessed via the $OSG_GRID environment variable.  Can be defined in terms of an environment variable (e.g. =$FOO=) that will be evaluated on the worker node.  Read access is required, though worker nodes don't need write access. |

---++ Subcluster / Resource Entry Configuration
Subcluster and Resource Entry configuration is for reporting about the worker resources on your site. A *subcluster* is a homogeneous set of worker node hardware; a *resource* is a set of subcluster(s) with common capabilities that will be reported to the ATLAS AGIS system.

*At least one Subcluster or Resource Entry section* is required on a CE; please populate the information for all your subclusters. This information will be reported to a central collector and will be used to send !GlideIns / pilot jobs to your site; having accurate information is necessary for OSG jobs to effectively use your resources.

For historical reasons, this configuration is specified in the file named 30-gip.ini, installed by the =osg-configure-gip= RPM.

This configuration uses multiple sections of the OSG configuration files:
   * [[#GipSubcluster][Subcluster*]]: options about homogeneous subclusters
   * [[#GipResourceEntry][Resource Entry*]]: options for specifying ATLAS queues for AGIS

---+++ Notes for multi-CE sites.
If you would like to properly advertise multiple CEs per cluster, make sure that you:
   * Set the value of site_name in the "Site Information" section to be the same for each CE.
   * Have the *exact* same configuration values for the Subcluster* and Resource Entry* sections in each CE.

#GipSubcluster
---+++ Subcluster Configuration

Each homogeneous set of worker node hardware is called a *subcluster*.  For each subcluster in your cluster, fill in the information about the worker node hardware by creating a new Subcluster section with a unique name in the following format:  =[Subcluster CHANGEME]=, where CHANGEME is the globally unique subcluster name (yes, it must be a *globally* unique name for the whole grid, not just unique to your site. Get creative.)

This section differs from other sections in that there are no set options in this section.  Rather, the options set in this section will be placed in the =osg-local-job-environment.conf= verbatim.  The options in this section are case sensitive and the case will be preserved when they are converted to environment variables.  The =osg-local-job-environment.conf= file gets sourced by jobs run on your cluster so any variables set in this section will appear in the environment of jobs run on your system.

Adding a line such as =My_Setting = my_Value= would result in the an environment variable called =My_Setting= set to =my_Value= in the job's environment. =my_Value= can also be defined in terms of an environment variable (i.e =My_Setting = $my_Value=) that will be evaluated on the worker node. For example, to add a variable =MY_PATH= set to =/usr/local/myapp=, you'd have the following:
<pre class="file">
[Local Settings]

MY_PATH = /usr/local/myapp
</pre>

This section is contained in =/etc/osg/config.d/40-localsettings.ini= which is provided by the =osg-configure-ce= RPM.

Reporting to the central CE Collectors is configured in this section. For historical reasons, this is found in =30-infoservices.ini=, installed by the =osg-configure-infoservices= RPM. In the majority of cases, this file can be left untouched; you only need to configure this section if you wish to report to your own CE Collector instead of the ones run by OSG Operations.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *enabled* | =True=, =False=, =Ignore= | True if reporting should be configured and enabled. |
| ce_collectors | String | The server(s) !HTCondor-CE information should be sent to. \

---++ Gratia

This section configures Gratia.  If =probes= is set to =UNAVAILABLE=, then =osg-configure= will use appropriate default values.  If you need to specify custom reporting (e.g. a local gratia collector) in addition to the default probes,  =%(osg-jobmanager-gratia)s=,  =%(osg-gridftp-gratia)s=, =%(osg-metric-gratia)s=,
=%(itb-jobmanager-gratia)s=, =%(itb-gridftp-gratia)s=, =%(itb-metric-gratia)s= are defined in the default configuration files to make it easier to specify the standard osg reporting. This section is contained in =/etc/osg/config.d/30-gratia.ini= which is provided by the =osg-configure-gratia= RPM.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *enabled* | =True= , =False=, =Ignore= | This should be set to True if gratia should be configured and enabled on the installation being configured. |
| *resource* | String | This should be set to the resource name as given in the OIM registration |
| *probes* | String | This should be set to the gratia probes that should be enabled.  A probe is specified by using as [probe_type]:server:port .  Valid probe_types are metric (for rsv), jobmanager (for the appropriate jobmanager probe) and gridftp for the gridftp-transfer-probe.  |
