---+!! SAZ Install Guide
%TOC{depth="3"}%

---# Introduction

SAZ enables a Grid site administrator to enforce a Grid job whitelist/blacklist capability at his/her site. It does so by providing the site administrator the capability to ban (disable) or enable identity attributes that are associated with the credential that the user uses to run Grid jobs.  These identity attributes are:
   * =User= - A user can be authorized or disabled from running grid jobs based on his/her DN (Distinguished Name), certificate serial number or proxy remaining lifetime. This is useful if you want to temporarally (or permanently) ban a user in response to a security incident or investigation (e.g. following a report that a certificate has been compromised).
   * =Proxy Lifetime= - Enforce a limit on proxy lifetime on your grid resource.
   * =CA= (Certificate Authority) based on its DN. This would ban a CA and thus all users using grid certificates issued by that CA from running grid jobs on your site.
   * =VO= (Virtual Organization) based on its name. This would ban a VO and thus all users belonging to that VO from running grid jobs on your site.
   * =FQAN= (Fully Qualified Attribute Name) based on its name. This would disable any jobs coming in with voms credentials generated using this FQAN from running on your site.

SAZ also enables an administrator to "trust" a user - which means user is allowed to run grid jobs on the site in question using a vanilla grid proxy (i.e. without a FQAN)

---# About This Document

This document is intended for site administrators who want to install and configure the %LINK_GLOSSARY_SAZ% service.

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions" section="Header"}%
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocConventions" section="CommandLine"}%


---# Requirements

---## Host and OS

   * A host for the SAZ service<p>It is strongly recommended that SAZ be installed on a separate computer from the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%, although it is possible to install both on the same computer. But for security reasons, it is best to run the authorization service separately from any resource that can run user jobs.</p>
   * OS is %SUPPORTED_OS%
   * Root access

---## Users

The SAZ installation will create two users unless they exist already:

%STARTSECTION{"Users"}%
| *User* | *Default UID* | *Comment* |
| =mysql= |  27  | Runs the !MySQL database server, which SAZ uses |
| =tomcat= |  91  | Runs the Tomcat web application server, which runs SAZ |

Note that if UIDs 27 and 91 are taken already but not used for the appropriate users, you will experience errors. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/KnownProblems#Reserved_user_ids_especially_for][Details...]]
%ENDSECTION{"Users"}%

---## Certificates

| *Certificate* | *Certificate Owner* | *Path to Certificate* |
| HTTP service certificate | =tomcat= | =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= <br> =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem= |

---# Installation Procedure

%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%
%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefCaCerts" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---## Install and Configure SAZ

---### Install SAZ

   1. Install the SAZ Service <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-saz</pre>
   1. Install Fetch CRL: %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="FetchCRLInstallShort"}% 
   1. Configure Tomcat to use GSI <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh</pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> This step will overwrite your =/etc/tomcat5/server.xml= file (For OSG 3.x (RPM) installs on EL5 systems) and =/etc/tomcat6/server.xml= file (For OSG 3.x (RPM) installs on EL6 systems) ; if you are using Tomcat on this host for non-grid purposes, you may want to save the =server.xml= file first, run the script, then merge your own configuration back into the file.</p>

---### Configure SAZ database

In this section, you will configure the SAZ !MySQL database by creating a new database. Pick the appropriate subsection below for your environment.

---#### New Installation

   1. Start !MySQL<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service mysqld start</pre>
   1. Create a new SAZ database<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/bin/saz-setup-mysql-database --user sazdbuser --host localhost:3306 --password <em>PASSWORD</em></pre><p><strong>Note:</strong> This password will be in plaintext in the =/etc/saz/hibernate.cfg.xml= file, so choose one that is not used anywhere else. The =hibernate.cfg.xml= file should be readable only by the =tomcat= user, but this situation provides light security at best.</p>
   1. Add yourself as a SAZ administrator<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% saz-add-mysql-admin '<em>Admin DN</em>' '<em>Admin Name</em>' </pre>
   1. [Optional but recommended:] Apply reasonable !MySQL security settings<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation</pre>


---### Set Initial SAZ Configuration

In this section, you will set up an initial SAZ configuration file



---# Troubleshooting

---## Useful Configuration and Log Files

Configuration Files
| *Service or Process* | *Configuration File* | *Description* |
| !MySQL | =/etc/my.cnf= | !MySQL configuration, e.g. server port |
| tomcat (EL5) | =/etc/tomcat5/= | Tomcat configuration files |
| tomcat (EL6) | =/etc/tomcat6/= | Tomcat configuration files |
| SAZ | =/etc/saz/= | SAZ configuration files |

Log files
| *Service or Process* | *Log File* | *Description* |
| tomcat (EL5) | =/var/log/tomcat5/catalina.out= | This is the Tomcat log file. Problems (and a lot of noise) are reported here. |
| | =/var/log/tomcat5/trustmanager.log= | The trustmanager handles things related to authentication. Useful errors are sometimes here. |
| tomcat (EL6) | =/var/log/tomcat6/catalina.out= | This is the Tomcat log file. Problems (and a lot of noise) are reported here. |
| | =/var/log/tomcat6/trustmanager.log= | The trustmanager handles things related to authentication. Useful errors are sometimes here. |
| *SAZ* | =/var/log/saz/sazserver.log= | SAZ server logs and error messages |
