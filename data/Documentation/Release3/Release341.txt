Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues
   * Using the LCMAPS VOMS will result in a failing "supported VO" RSV test ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2763][SOFTWARE-2763]]). This can be ignored and a fix is targeted for the August release.
   * In !GlideinWMS, a small configuration change must be added to account for changes in HTCondor 8.6. Add the following line to the HTCondor configuration.

---++ Updating to the new release

To update to the OSG 3.4 series, please consult the page on [[Documentation/Release3/OSGReleaseSeries][updating between release series]]. 

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need to [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
