---++Globus Error: 74

---+++Syntax:

=GRAM Job submission failed because the job manager failed to open stderr (error 74)=

---+++Known causes:

The remote job manager could not connect to the client.  This is usually caused by GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE not being set or being stopped by a firewall.

---+++Recommendations:

Confirm GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE is set
Confirm the port range is open on the firewall
Confirm GLOBUS_HOSTNAME is set to the correct FQDN

Example:
<verbatim>
$ globus-hostname
<fully qualified domain name>
</verbatim>
<verbatim> 
$ echo $GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
40000,41000
</verbatim> 

If it is not, add &lt;fully qualified domain name&gt; to /etc/hosts or export $GLOBUS_HOSTNAME = &lt;fully qualified domain name&gt;
