---+!! Troubleshooting Gratia Accounting

%TOC%

---+ About this document
%RED%DRAFT: This document is in progress. It is not done and should not be considered useful yet.%ENDCOLOR% 

This document will help you troubleshoot problems with the Gratia Accounting, particularly with problems in collecting and reporting accounting information to the central OSG accounting service. See also other documents recommended in the Reference section below.

This document follows the general OSG documentation conventions: %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT% showlink="Click to expand document conventions..."}%

---++ How to get Help?
To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][Help Procedure]]. 

---+ Understanding Gratia Probes

Gratia is software used in OSG to gather accounting information. 

Diagram of how Gratia works.

---++ Overall process of how Gratia probes work

<pre class="file">
Every N minutes, cron job runs (or service works) [todo, check what N is]
	Reads ProbeConfig
	Grabs files from /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratifiles/...
	Pushes data to Gratia collector as a bundle. (May wait for extra time if don't have a full bundle)
	Everything is logged to /var/log/gratia
	If fails:
		Nothing is removed from /var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles
		Errors are logged to log files
		Will try again next time. 
		In some cases, failed transfers get moved somewhere else. No details, [todo] ask Brian
</pre>


---++ Running Gratia probes

<pre class="rootscreen">
service gratia-probes-cron start
service gratia-probes-cron stop
service gratia-probes-cron status
</pre>

---++ Configuring Gratia

=osg-configure= does the editing, at least on the CE. 

Some bits on Gratia from config.ini

Some bits on Gratia's ProbeConfig dir.

---+ Common Gratia Problems

PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR

Debugging trick: give bad URL for collector so you can see the files. these files have a brief lifetime because they are created by the probe and (normally) sent immediately. 


---+ Appendix: Important Gratia files

This document cannot cover all the errors you might experience. If you need to look for more data, you can look at log files for the various services on your CE. 

| *File* | *Purpose* |
| =/var/log/gratia/%RED%DATE%ENDCOLOR%.log | Log file that records information about processing and uploading of Gratia accounting data |
| =/var/log/gratia/gridftpTransfer.log= | Log file specific to the Gratia !GridFTP probe |
| =/var/lib/gratia/data= | Location for Condor and PBS job data before being processed by Gratia<br>Condor's =PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR= should be set to this location |
| =/var/lib/gratia/tmp/gratiafiles= | Location for temporary Gratia data as it is being processed. Usually empty.<br>If you have file more than 30 minutes old in this directory, there may be a problem |
| =/etc/gratia/%RED%PROBE-NAME%ENDCOLOR%/ProbeConfig= | Configuration for Gratia probes<br>There is one per probe type</br>Normally you don't need to edit this |
