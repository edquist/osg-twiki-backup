---++ About This Guide

LCMAPS is a software library for mapping grid certificates of incoming connections to specific Unix accounts. The LCMAPS VOMS plugin enables LCMAPS to make mapping decisions based on the VOMS attributes of grid certificates, e.g., <code>/cms/Role=production/Capability=NULL</code>. Starting in OSG 3.4, the LCMAPS VOMS plugin will replace GUMS and edg-mkgridmap as the authentication method at OSG sites.

The OSG provides a default set of mappings from VOMS attributes to Unix accounts. By configuring LCMAPS, you can override these mappings, including changing the Unix account that a VO is mapped to, banning based on VOMS attributes, banning a specific user, or adding a VO, VO group, VO role, and/or user that is not in the OSG's set of mappings.

Use this page to learn how to install and configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin to authenticate users to access your resources on a per-VO basis.


---++ Requirements

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.DocumentationSnippets" section="OsgPreReqs"}%

---++ Installing the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin

Install =lcmaps=, the default mapfile, and the configuration tools:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install lcmaps vo-client-lcmaps-voms osg-configure-misc
</pre>

---++ Configuring the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin

The following section describes the steps required to configure the LCMAPS VOMS plugin for authentication. If you are using OSG 3.3 packages, there are software-specific instructions that must be followed for [[Documentation.Release3/InstallHTCondorCE][HTCondor-CE]], [[Documentation.Release3/InstallOSGGridFTP][GridFTP]], and [[Documentation.Release3/InstallXrootd][XRootD]]. To check if you are running OSG 3.3, run the following command:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -q --queryformat="%{VERSION}\n" osg-release
</pre>

Additionally, there is [[#OptionalConfig][optional configuration]] if you need to make changes to the default mappings.

---+++ Enabling the LCMAPS VOMS plugin

To configure your host to use LCMAPS VOMS plugin authentication, edit =/etc/osg/config.d/10-misc.ini= and set the following options:

<pre class="file">glexec_location = UNAVAILABLE
edit_lcmaps_db = True
authorization_method = vomsmap</pre>

#UnixAccounts
---+++ Supporting mapped VOs and users 

Unix accounts must exist for each VO, VO role, VO group, or user you choose to support in the [[#RefConfigFiles][mapfiles]]:

   1. Consult the default VO mappings in =/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default= to determine the mapped Unix account names. Each of the mapfiles has the following format:\
<pre class="file">
"&lt;VO, VO role, VO group or user&gt;" &lt;Unix account&gt;
</pre>
   1. Create Unix accounts for each VO, VO role, VO group, and user that you wish to support
   1. Edit =/etc/osg/config.d/40-siteinfo.ini= and specify the supported VOs per [[Documentation.Release3/IniConfigurationOptions#Subcluster_Resource_Entry_Config][Subcluster or ResourceEntry section]]:\
<pre class="file">
allowed_vos="VO1,VO2..."
</pre>

#ApplyConfig
---+++ Applying configuration settings

Making changes to the OSG configuration files in the =/etc/osg/config.d= directory does not apply those settings to software automatically. For the OSG settings, use the [[IniConfigurationOptions][osg-configure]] tool to validate (to a limited extent) and apply the settings to the relevant software components. If instead you wish to manage the LCMAPS VOMS plugin configuration yourself, skip to the [[#RefManConfig][manual configuration section]].

   1. <p>Make all changes to =.ini= files in the =/etc/osg/config.d= directory</p>\
       <p><strong>Note:</strong> This document describes the critical settings for the LCMAPS VOMS plugin and related software. You may need to configure other software that is installed on your host, too.</p>
   1. Validate the configuration settings:\
<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT% osg-configure -v</pre>
   1. Once the validation command succeeds without errors, apply the configuration settings:\
<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT% osg-configure -c</pre>

#OptionalConfig
---+++ Optional configuration

You can map or ban users by their certificates' Distinguished Names (DNs) or by their proxies' VOMS attributes; see the following subsections. For a table of the configuration files and their order of evaluation, consult the [[#RefConfigFiles][reference section]].

   * [[#OptionalMapVos][Mapping VOs]]
   * [[#OptionalMapUsers][Mapping users]]
   * [[#OptionalBanVos][Banning VOs]]
   * [[#OptionalBanUsers][Banning users]]

#OptionalMapVos
---++++ Mapping VOs

=/etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile= is used to map VOs, VO roles, or VO groups to Unix accounts based on their VOMS attributes. An example of the format of a =voms-mapfile= follows:

<pre class="file">
# map GLOW jobs to the 'glow' Unix account.
"/GLOW/*" glow
# map GLOW jobs in the chtc group to the 'glow1' Unix account.
"/GLOW/chtc/*" glow1
# map GLOW jobs with the htpc role to the 'glow2' Unix account.
"/GLOW/Role=htpc/*" glow2
</pre>

Each non-commented line is a shell-style pattern which is compared against the user's VOMS attributes, and a Unix account that the user will be mapped to if the pattern matches.

%NOTE%The Unix account must exist for the user to be mapped. If a VO's Unix account is missing, that VO will not be able to access your resources.

#OptionalMapUsers
---++++ Mapping users

=/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= is used to map specific users to Unix accounts based on their certificates' DNs. An example of the format of a =grid-mapfile= follows:

<pre class="file">
# map Matyas's FNAL DN to the 'matyas' Unix account
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Matyas Selmeci/CN=UID:matyas" matyas
</pre>

%NOTE%The Unix account must exist for the user to be mapped. If a user's Unix account is missing, that user will not be able to access your resources.

#OptionalBanVos
---++++ Banning VOs

=/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile= is used to ban an entire VO or a role withing a VO from accessing resources on your machine. An example of the format of a =ban-voms-mapfile= follows:

<pre class="file">
# ban CMS production jobs
"/cms/Role=production/*"
</pre>

Each non-commented line is a shell-style pattern which is compared against a user's VOMS attributes. If the pattern matches, that user will be unable to access your resources.

%WARNING%=/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile= _must_ exist, even if you are not banning any VOs. In that case, the file should be blank. If the file does not exist, LCMAPS will ban every user.

#OptionalBanUsers
---++++ Banning users

=/etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile= is used to ban specific users from accessing your resources based on their certificates' DNs. An example of the format of a =ban-mapfile= follows:

<pre class="file">
# ban Matyas's FNAL DN
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Matyas Selmeci/CN=UID:matyas"
</pre>

%WARNING%=/etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile= _must_ exist, even if you are not banning any users. In that case, the file should be blank. If the file does not exist, LCMAPS will ban every user.

---++ Validating the LCMAPS VOMS Plugin

To validate the LCMAPS VOMS plugin by itself, use the following procedure to test mapping your own cert to a user:

   1. Verify your DN is _not_ in =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile=, or else it will generate a false positive
   1. Verify your DN is _not_ in =/etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile=, or else it will generate a false negative
   1. Install the =llrun= and =voms-clients= packages:<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install llrun voms-clients</pre>
   1. As an unprivileged user, create a VOMS proxy (filling in %RED%YOUR_VO%ENDCOLOR% with a VO you are a member of):<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%YOUR_VO%ENDCOLOR%</pre>
   1. Verify that your credentials are mapped as expected:<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% llrun -s -l mode=pem,policy=authorize_only,db=/etc/lcmaps.db \
   -p/tmp/x509up_u`id -u`</pre>

If you did not get correctly mapped, check your proxy's FQAN by running:<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info -fqan</pre> and make sure it matches one of the patterns in =/etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile= or =/usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default=, and does not match any patterns in =/etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile=.

#RefManConfig
---+++ Manual Configuration

This section is intended for use as reference if you choose to forego configuring the LCMAPS VOMS plugin via osg-configure (i.e., if you prefer a configuration management system like [[https://www.ansible.com/][Ansible]] or [[https://puppet.com/][Puppet]]). Therefore, the following instructions serve as a replacement for [[#ApplyConfig][this section]].

LCMAPS is configured in =/etc/lcmaps.db=. and since the VOMS plugin is a newer component, configuration for it may not be present in your existing =/etc/lcmaps.db= file.

   1. Ensure the following lines are present in the "Module definitions" section (the top section, before =authorize_only=) of =/etc/lcmaps.db=: \
<pre class="file">
gridmapfile = "lcmaps_localaccount.mod"
              "-gridmap /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile"
banfile = "lcmaps_ban_dn.mod"
          "-banmapfile /etc/grid-security/ban-mapfile"
banvomsfile = "lcmaps_ban_fqan.mod"
              "-banmapfile /etc/grid-security/ban-voms-mapfile"
vomsmapfile = "lcmaps_voms_localaccount.mod"
              "-gridmap /etc/grid-security/voms-mapfile"
defaultmapfile = "lcmaps_voms_localaccount2.mod"
                 "-gridmap /usr/share/osg/voms-mapfile-default"

verifyproxynokey = "lcmaps_verify_proxy2.mod"
          "--allow-limited-proxy"
          "--discard_private_key_absence"
          " -certdir /etc/grid-security/certificates"
</pre>
   1. Edit the =authorize_only= section so that it contains only the following uncommented lines:\
<pre class="file">
verifyproxynokey -&gt; banfile
banfile -&gt; banvomsfile | bad
banvomsfile -&gt; gridmapfile | bad
gridmapfile -&gt; good | vomsmapfile
vomsmapfile -&gt; good | defaultmapfile
defaultmapfile -&gt; good | bad
</pre>
   1. Edit =/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf= and ensure that it contains the following uncommented line:\
<pre class="file">
globus_mapping liblcas_lcmaps_gt4_mapping.so lcmaps_callout
</pre>
