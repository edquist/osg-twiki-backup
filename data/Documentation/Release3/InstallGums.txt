---+!! GUMS Service Install
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC%

---+ Introduction
This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of installing and configuring the GUMS service.
%IMPORTANT% This is an unreleased version of GUMS.  The current released, supported version installation is [[ReleaseDocumentation.GumsClientInstall][here]]. Please note that it still packaged with Pacman, not RPM.
%WARNING% This describes a prototype packaging of an unreleased version of GUMS.  It is meant for testers, %RED%not for deployment%ENDCOLOR%.

---+ About This Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for testers that are migrating a GUMS server from a pacman install to an RPM install.  It assumes that you have a pre-existing =gums.config= file.

---+ Requirements
A RHEL5 (or !CentOS 5, SL5) machine with [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][EPEL]] repos enabled.

---+ Install Instructions
%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

GUMS requires CA certificates
%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefCaCerts" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---++ Install and Configure GUMS
   1. Install the GUMS Service <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-development install gums-service </pre>
   1. Configure Tomcat to use GSI <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /var/lib/trustmanager-tomcat/configure.sh </pre>  Note this will overwrite your =/etc/tomcat5/server.xml=; if you are using tomcat on this node for non-grid purposes, you may want to consider a hand configuration.
   1. If this is a fresh mysql install, we recommend running !RedHat's =mysql_secure_installation= script to apply reasonable security settings.
   1. If migrating from another GUMS installation, dump the GUMS_1_3 database to a text file from the old server, and load it into the new !MySQL server.
   1. Copy an appropriate =gums.config= into =/etc/gums/gums.config=.  Update it to reflect the new username and password for the mysql server.  We *highly recommend* having GUMS authenticate with !MySQL using =localhost= instead of the actual hostname; this will cause !MySQL to use a local Unix socket instead of listening on the network, which is more secure.

---++ Services Run

To start GUMS, you must do the following
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service fetch-crl-cron start
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service fetch-crl-boot start
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service mysqld start
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service tomcat5 start
</pre>

We recommend to have all these services start at boot:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig mysqld on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig tomcat5 on
</pre>
