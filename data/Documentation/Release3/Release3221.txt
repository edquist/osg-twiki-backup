#KnownIssues
---++ Known Issues

The changes to implement reporting of HTCondor CE attributes to BDII are incomplete. As a workaround, a configuration file can be manually edited to enable this functionality. The code is a work-in-progress and the settings in the configuration file are likely to change. This problem should be corrected in the this release of the OSG Software Stack.

To enable reporting of HTCondor attributes to BDII, add the following section to 10-gateway.ini manually:

<verbatim>
[HTCondorCE]
; Configuration related to the OSGCE (condor_ce)
;
enabled = True
;
; ; Required only if port is different from 9619 default.
; ; port =
port = 9619
</verbatim>

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

This is a release in a newer [[Documentation.Release3.OSGReleaseSeries][OSG Release Series]].
To update to this new series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the new OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>


%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
