---+ Condor Information

---++ 1.0 Installing Condor
You can install Condor from at least three places:

   1. Condor from the OSG repository. <br>We provide Condor in the OSG repository. We've borrowed the RPM from Fedora, (by which we mean that we've copied their source RPM and rebuilt it against the version of Globus which we provide). This version of Condor provides _most_ of Condor's functionality, except for Standard Universe and Condor-G support for CREAM and !NorduGrid.
   1. Condor RPM from the Condor Team<br> You can install Condor from the Condor Team's [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/yum/][yum repository]]. 
   1. You can install Condor from a binary tarball (from the Condor Team) or build it from source.<br>These installations can be installed in an arbitrary location on your CE.

Options 1 and 2 should work fine with the caveat that option 2 only works if you are installing Condor 7.6 or later. Option 3 works if you do a bit of upfront effort because ome RPMs in the OSG repository depend on having Condor installed via RPM, but option 3 wil not appear to provide Condor via RPM. In order to convince RPM that you have installed Condor, you can install a "dummy" RPM called =empty-condor=. This will convince RPM to be happy but will but will not actually provide Condor. To do this: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-testing install empty-condor</pre>

---++ 2.0 What needs Condor?

Several packages in the OSG software repository require Condor to be installed via RPM (or appear to have been installed via RPM, as described above):

   1. The =osg-ce-condor= package requires Condor. It installs the GRAM jobmanager for Condor and the Gratia probe for Condor, both of which require Condor to be installed.
   1. The =osg-client-condor= package requires Condor. The only difference between =osg-client= and =osg-client-condor= is the inclusion of Condor. If you want to use your own version of Condor with the client, simply install the =osg-client= package.
   1. The =glexec= package (indirectly) depends on a subset of Condor, the =condor_procd=, which is used to track processes created by glexec so they can be reliably killed. The OSG RPM for Condor provides a separate package for the procd that doesn't require you to install all of Condor, while the Condor Team's RPM for Condor requires you to install all of Condor if you want just the =condor_procd=.
