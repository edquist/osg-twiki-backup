---+ Installing and Maintaining HTCondor-CE-Bosco

%TOC{depth="3"}%

---++ Pre-Reqs

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

   * Ensure the host has [[SupportedOperatingSystems][a supported operating system]]
   * Obtain root access to the host
   * Prepare [[YumRepositories][the required Yum repositories]]
   * Install [[InstallCertAuth][CA certificates]]




---++ Installing HTCondor-CE-Bosco

An HTCondor-CE-Bosco installation consists of the job gateway (i.e., the HTCondor-CE job router) and other support software (e.g., !GridFTP, a Gratia probe, authorization software). To simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required software with a single command.

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3/OSGReleaseSeries" section="Update"}%

  <li>
    <p>Install the CE software:</p>
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install --enablerepo=osg-development osg-ce-bosco</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


---+++ SSH Key to Remote Login Host

It is required to have an passwordless SSH to the remote login host.  You can create an passwordless ssh key to the remote host with the =ssh-keygen= and =ssh-copy-id= commands.  In the following commands, we save the key in =/etc/osg/bosco.key= for use later in the configuration.

   1. Create the ssh key
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ssh-keygen -f /etc/osg/bosco.key</pre>
   1. Copy the SSH key to the remote host.
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ssh-copy-id -i /etc/osg/bosco.key &lt;username&gt;@&lt;remotehost&gt; </pre>


---++ Configuration

The configuration of the HTCondor-CE-Bosco is much the same as the regular [[InstallHTCondorCE#Configuring_HTCondor_CE][HTCondor-CE]].  The differences are noted below:

---+++ Enable Bosco

Enable Bosco by editing the =enabled= field in the =/etc/osg/config.d/20-<span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">bosco</span>.ini= file:\
<pre class="file">enabled = <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">True</span></pre>
