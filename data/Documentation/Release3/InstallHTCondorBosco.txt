---+ Installing and Maintaining HTCondor-CE-Bosco

%TOC{depth="3"}%

---++ About This Guide

The HTCondor-CE-Bosco software is a special configuration of the [[InstallHTCondorCE][HTCondor-CE]] _job gateway_ software that can submit jobs to your local batch system over SSH. Like the HTCondor-CE, it handles authorization and delegation of jobs but unlike HTCondor-CE, it does not have to be installed locally and is intended to be hosted by the OSG User Support group. 

Use this page to learn how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot HTCondor-CE-Bosco from the OSG software repositories.

%NOTE% HTCondor-CE-Bosco uses development versions of HTCondor in its software chain so therefore should be considered to have all the caveats of development-grade software

---++ Before Starting

As with all OSG software installations, there are some one-time (per host) steps to prepare in advance:

   * Ensure the host has [[SupportedOperatingSystems][a supported operating system]]
   * Obtain root access to the host
   * Prepare [[YumRepositories][the required Yum repositories]]
   * Install [[InstallCertAuth][CA certificates]]

---++ Installing HTCondor-CE-Bosco

An HTCondor-CE-Bosco installation consists of the job gateway (i.e., the HTCondor-CE job router) and other support software (e.g., !GridFTP, a Gratia probe, authorization software). To simplify installation, OSG provides convenience RPMs that install all required software with a single command.

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3/OSGReleaseSeries" section="Update"}%

  <li>
    <p>Install the CE software:</p>
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-ce-bosco</pre>
  </li>
</ol>


---+++ SSH Key to Remote Login Host

It is required to have an passwordless SSH to the remote login host.  You can create an passwordless ssh key to the remote host with the =ssh-keygen= and =ssh-copy-id= commands.  In the following commands, we save the key in =/etc/osg/bosco.key= for use later in the configuration.

   1. Create the ssh key.  You will need to press enter twice at this prompt.
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ssh-keygen -f /etc/osg/bosco.key</pre>
   1. Copy the SSH key to the remote host.
      <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ssh-copy-id -i /etc/osg/bosco.key &lt;username&gt;@&lt;remotehost&gt; </pre>


---++ Configuring HTCondor-CE-Bosco

The configuration of the HTCondor-CE-Bosco is much the same as the regular [[InstallHTCondorCE#Configuring_HTCondor_CE][HTCondor-CE]].  The differences are noted below:

Enable Bosco by editing the =enabled= field in the =/etc/osg/config.d/20-<span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">bosco</span>.ini= file:\
<pre class="file">enabled = <span style="background-color: #FFCCFF;">True</span></pre>

Additionally in the =/etc/osg/config.d/20-bosco.ini=, the other configuration values are as follows:

   * =users=: A comma separated list of users to enable Bosco submissions.  This list of users are the only users that will be able to submit to the remote cluster through Bosco.  Traditionally, the authentication step of the HTCondor-CE will map a certificate to a specific local username.  This mapping may be in GUMS or edg-mkgridmap.
   * =endpoint=: The remote cluster submission host for which Bosco will submit jobs to the scheduler.  This is in the form of =user@example.com=, exactly as you would use to ssh into the remote cluster.
   * =batch=: The type of scheduler installed on the remote cluster.
   * =ssh_key=: The location of the ssh key, as created above.  This should be =/etc/osg/bosco.key=.

After configuration all of the required fields in =/etc/osg/config.d/20-bosco.ini=, you can start the installation by running the osg-configure script:
<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% osg-configure -c </pre>

If you have not already logged into the remote cluster specific in the =endpoint= variable above, then you will be asked to accept the remote host's SSH fingerprint.

---++ Using HTCondor-CE-Bosco

Using HTCondor-CE-Bosco is the same as [[InstallHTCondorCE#UsingHTCondorCE][using the HTCondor-CE]]. %INCLUDE{"InstallHTCondorCE" section="UsingHTCondorCE"}%

---++ Verifying HTCondor-CE-Bosco

%INCLUDE{"InstallHTCondorCE" section="Validation"}%

---++ Troubleshooting HTCondor-CE-Bosco

Most issues are caused by the interaction between the HTCondor-CE and the remote cluster.  Logs of these interactions are located at =/var/log/condor-ce/GridManager.log.*=. You can increase the debugging level of the logs by setting =GRIDMANAGER_DEBUG = D_FULLDEBUG= in =/etc/condor-ce/config.d/80-bosco-routes.conf=
