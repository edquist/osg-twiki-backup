---+ Trash/Troubleshooting Common Job Submission (Globus GRAM) Errors

---++ Error Code 7 (Authorization errors)

The grid users is not authorized to submit a job:

<pre class="screen">
% globus-job-run localhost /usr/bin/whoami
GRAM Job submission failed because authentication with the remote server failed (error code 7)
</pre>

There are a few reasons this error could occur. 

---+++ Grid-mapfile authorization failed

If you use a grid-mapfile (probably with =edg-mkgridmap=) is the user in the gridmapfile? If not, you'll see an error message similar to this one in =/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log=:
<pre class="screen">
TIME: Fri Dec  2 09:44:47 2011
 PID: 875 -- Failure: globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization. globus_gss_assist: 
             Gridmap lookup failure: Could not map /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Alain Roy 424511
</pre>

---+++ GUMS authorization failed
If you use GUMS for authorization, is GUMS running and reachable? Here is an example error message in =/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log= that shows the gatekeeper unable to reach the GUMS server.

<pre class="file">
TIME: Fri Dec  2 10:17:20 2011
 PID: 2160 -- Failure: globus_gss_assist_gridmap() failed authorization. globus_gss_assist: Error invoking callout
globus_callout_module: The callout returned an error
an unknown error occurred
</pre>

This isn't very illustrative because the software that communicates with GUMS (lcmaps) writes to =/var/log/messages=. There we can see a better error message:

<pre class="file">
Dec  2 10:12:42 fermicloud081 l_l_gt4[2051]: 	xacmlqueryscas(): XACML: Interaction failed: %RED%TCP/IP, SSL or SOAP Error with endpoint:%ENDCOLOR%
               "https://fermicloud081.fnal.gov:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort" 
Dec  2 10:12:43 fermicloud081 l_l_gt4[2051]: 2011-12-02.10:06:26.0000002051.0000000000 : 	
               lcmaps_plugin_scas_client-plugin_run(): scas client plugin failed 
</pre>

If GUMS is running and allowing connections from the CE, you need to dig deeper. Temporarily edit =/etc/sysconfig/globus-gatekeeper= by adding two lines:

<pre class="file">
export LCMAPS_LOG_LEVEL=5
export LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL=5
</pre>

This will increase the output in =/var/logl/messages=. *Warning*: This will make the log much bigger! You'll want to remove these lines when you're done debugging A few things to check for:

   1. Check that the URL for GUMS is correct. It should be of the form: =https:/%RED/HOSTNAME%ENDCOLOR%:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort=. For example, you might see:<pre class="file">
Jan  9 12:55:35 alachua l_l_gt4[20879]:         xacmlqueryscas(): XACML: Using SCAS service endpoint: https://gums.ihepa.ufl.edu:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</pre>
   1. Here's an example error that shows that the user wasn't made or had some other problem (such as an LDAP problem if you use LDAP for user account management.) :<pre class="file">
Jan  9 13:31:50 alachua l_l_gt4[5634]: Username_handler: Error: Couldn't find the username 'cms30054' in the password file.
</pre>

---++  GRAM Error code 12

Sample problem:
<pre class="screen">
% globus-job-run fermicloud081.fnal.gov /usr/bin/whoami
GRAM Job submission failed because the connection to the server failed (check host and port) (error code 12)
</pre>

---+++ Is the gatekeepeer running?

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% ps auwx | grep globus-gatekeeper | grep -v grep
</pre>

Nope, run it:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service globus-gatekeeper start
Started globus-gatekeeper                                  [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]
</pre>

%NOTE% If your gatekeeper doesn't have credentials in =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem=, and =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem= it will appear to start up correctly, but will not actually be running. 


---+++ CA Certificate problems?
Are your CA certificates properly installed in =/etc/grid-security/certificates=? Are they up to date? A sample error message from =/var/logl/globus-gatekeeper.log= that shows that =/etc/grid-security/certificates= doesn't exist:

<pre class="screen">
 PID: 1079 -- Notice: 6: Got connection 198.51.254.71 at Fri Dec  2 09:49:58 2011

GSS authentication failure 
GSS Major Status: General failure

1) env. var. X509_CERT_DIR
2) $HOME/.globus/certificates
3) /etc/grid-security/certificates
4) $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/certificates

Failure: GSS failed Major:000d0000 Minor:0000000c Token:00000000
</pre>


---++ GRAM Error code 22

The grid user is authorized to submit a job, but cannot write to their directory:

<pre class="screen">
% globus-job-run localhost /usr/bin/whoami
GRAM Job submission failed because mkdir failed: /home/alainroy/.globus: Permission denied (error code 22)
</pre>

The error in =/var/log/globus/%RED%&lt;user%ENDCOLOR%.log=:
<pre class="screen">
ts=2011-12-02T15:44:02.093484Z id=644 event=gram.make_job_dir.end level=ERROR gramid=/16218020932513377141/290484376369931657/ status=-22 path=/home/alainroy/.globus/alainroy msg=%RED%"Error creating directory"%ENDCOLOR% errno=13 reason=%RED%"Permission denied"%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---++ GRAM Error Code 47

The grid user is authorized to submit a job to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%, but the assigned Unix account does not exist on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run fermiclou081.fnal.gov /usr/bin/whoami
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to run the job manager  (%RED%error code 47%ENDCOLOR%)
</pre>

The GRAM log file on the Compute Element =/var/log/globus-gatekeeper.log= will contain an entry indicating the missing Unix account:

<pre class="file">
 PID: 32172 -- Notice: 5: Authorized as local user: alainroo
Failure: getpwname() failed to find alainroo
</pre>

---+ Troubleshooting =edg-mkgridmap=


---++ Is edg-mkgridmap installed?

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%  rpm -q edg-mkgridmap
edg-mkgridmap-4.0.0-3.osg.noarch
</pre>

---++ Is edg-mkgridmap enabled?

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%  /sbin/service edg-mkgridmap status
Periodic edg-mkgridmap is %RED%disabled%ENDCOLOR%.
</pre>

If it is disabled, enable it:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service edg-mkgridmap start
Enabling periodic edg-mkgridmap:                           [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]
</pre>

---++ Are there errors in the log file?

Look in the log file in =/var/log/edg-mkgridmap.log= for any error messages. Here is a sample error message:

<pre class="file">
voms search(https://voms.grid.iu.edu:8443/voms/mis/special/services/VOMSCompatibility?method=getGridmapUsers): Not Found
</pre>

This says that it cannot fetch information from voms.grid.iu.edu for the "mis/special" group. This is due to a misconfiguration. My =/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf= file incorrectly has:

<pre class="file">
group vomss://voms.grid.iu.edu:8443/voms/mis%RED%/special%ENDCOLOR% mis
</pre>

instead of:
<pre class="file">
group vomss://voms.grid.iu.edu:8443/voms/mis mis
</pre>

---++ Did you map a user or VO to an account that doesn't exist?

Look in =/var/lib/osg/undefined-accounts= to see if you mapped a user or VO to an account that doesn't exist.

---++ Do you want to force the grid-mapfile to update now?

If you want to force edg-mkgridmap to run right now, you can:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
</pre>

---++ Are local users missing from the grid-mapfile? 

Check the configuration file =/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf=. It should contain (in part):

<pre class="file">
#### GMF_LOCAL: gmf_local grid-mapfile-local
gmf_local /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local
</pre>

Then make sure the file =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile-local= contains the desired %LINK_GLOSSARY_DN% to account mappings.

---+ Appendix: Log files

This document cannot cover all the errors you might experience. If you need to look for more data, you can look at log files for the various services on your CE.
