---++ OSG PKI Command Line Clients

%TOC%

---+++ Overview

The OSG PKI Command Line Clients provide a command-line interface for requesting and issuing host certificates from the OSG PKI. They complement the [[https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificateuser][OIM Web Interface]].

---+++ Prerequisites

The scripts are tested to work on Python version 2.4+. They have not been tested on Python version 3. 

If you have not already done so, you need to [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/YumRepositories#Install_the_Yum_Repositories_req][install the YUM repositories as required by OSG]].

---+++ Installation

The command-line scripts have been packaged as an RPM and were included with the [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/Release3111][OSG 3.1.11 release of 6 November 2012]].

To install the RPM, run:

<verbatim>
yum install osg-pki-tools
</verbatim>

---+++ Usage

---++++ pki-clients.ini

The INI file contains information divided into two sections for ITB and OIM such as:
   * Request URL
   * Approve URL
   * Retrieve URL
   * Host URL

These parameters are fed in as input to the script depending upon the mode of execution of the script i.e. test and OIM. The loading is centralized in the OSGPKIUtils.py script. This script checks for pki-clients.ini file at three location in order:
   * $HOME/.osg-pki/OSG_PKI.ini
   * ./pki-clients.ini
   * /etc/pki-clients.ini


---++++ osg-cert-request

 Sends a request for a host certificate.

 This script generates a private key and submits a request for a certificate to the OSG PKI. The request will be approved by an appropriate Grid Admin. You will receive an email when this approval has been completed containing directions on how to run 'osg-cert-retreive' to retrieve the certificate. It works in two modes:
   * CSR is provided by the user: Here the csr provided is just trimmed for begin and end certificate lines and the request is sent to the OIM
   * CSR is not provided by the user: Here the script generates a private key for the user. Writes it to default key file name or the one specified by -o. Then generates a new csr and sends it to OIM.

This script:
   * Generates a new host private key and CSR
   * Only important part of CSR is CN=<hostname> component
   * Saves the host private key to disk (as specified by the user)
   * Authenticates to OIM and posts the CSR as a request to OIM
   * Returns the request ID to the user
   * If the user provides the CSR, then this script would just send the same CSR to OIM

*Inputs:*
   * fully-qualified hostname
   * filename to store private key [Optional, default is ./hostkey.pem]
   * path to user's certificate [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_CERT environment variable, ~/.globus/usercert.pem]
   * path to user's private key [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_KEY environment variable, ~/.globus/userkey.pem]
   * Passphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.
   * User needs to provide VO name if the requested hostname has
    multiple VO's assigned

*Outputs:*
   * Private key, to filename specified by '-o' or ./hostkey.pem by default
   * Request Id, to stdout

*Usage*: osg-cert-request [options]
<verbatim>
*Options*:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CSR, --csr=CSR     Specify CSR name (default = gennew.csr)
  -o Output Keyfile, --outkeyfile=Output Keyfile
                        Specify the output filename for the retrieved user
                        certificate.  Default is ./hostkey.pem
  -y CC List, --cc=CC List
                        Specify the CC list(the email id's to be CCed). Separate values by ','
  -m Comment, --comment=Comment
                        The comment to be added to the request
  -t CN, --hostname=CN  Specify hostname for CSR (FQDN)
  -e EMAIL, --email=EMAIL
                        Email address to receive certificate
  -n NAME, --name=NAME  Name of user receiving certificate
  -p PHONE, --phone=PHONE
                        Phone number of user receiving certificate
  -v VO, --vo=VO
                        VO name of requested hostname
  -T, --test            Run in test mode
  -q, --quiet           don't print status messages to stdout
  -V, --version         Print the script version number and exit. 

</verbatim>

Examples.

OSG generates the key pair for the request.

<verbatim>
python osg-cert-request -t hostname.domain.com -e emailaddress@domain.com -n "Your Name" -p 9999999999 -y "xyz@domain.com,abc@domain.com" -m "This is my comment"
</verbatim>

If you want to request a service certificate, you need to escape backslash for service name inside CN like following.

<verbatim>
python osg-cert-request -t hostname.domain.com -e emailaddress@domain.com -n "Your Name" -p 9999999999 -y "rsv\/xyz@domain.com" -m "This is my comment"
</verbatim>

You can create your CSR on your target hosts using tools such as openssl and copy & paste generated CSR below.

<verbatim>
umask 077; openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout hostkey.pem -subj "/CN=osg-ce.example.edu" -out csr.pem
</verbatim>


Note that the DN will be overriden by the OSG PKI except for the CN component.

Submitting the request:
<verbatim>
python osg-cert-request -t hostname.domain.com -e emailaddress@domain.com -n "Your Name" -p 9999999999 -y "xyz@domain.com,abc@domain.com" -m "This is my comment" --csr csr.pem
</verbatim>

---++++ osg-cert-retrieve

Retrieve a certificate (host or user) from OIM given a request Id. Typically you will run this script after submitting a request with 'osg-cert-request' and receiving an email telling you your certificate has been approved.

You can also use this script to retrieve other certificates that have been previously issued (assuming you know their request ID number).

Since certificates are public, no authentication of the user is required.

This script:
   * Accepts a request Id from the user
   * Connects to OIM and requests the certificate identified by the request ID
   * Writes the certificate to disk (as specified by the user)

*Inputs:*
   * Request ID
   * Filename to store certificate [Optional, default is ./hostcert.pem]

*Outputs:*
   * Host certificate as PEM, to filename specified or ./hostcert.pem

*Usage*:osg-cert-retrieve -h/--help [for detailed explanations of options]

<verbatim>
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i ID, --id=ID        Specify ID# of certificate to retrieve[Required]
  -o ID, --certfile=ID  Specify the output filename for the retrieved user
                        certificate . Default is ./hostcert.pem
  -T, --test            Run in test mode
  -q, --quiet           don't print status messages to stdout
  -V, --version         Print the script version number and exit. 
</verbatim>

Example:

<verbatim>
python osg-cert-retrieve -i 555
</verbatim>

---++++ osg-gridadmin-cert-request

Request and retrieve multliple host certificates from OIM. Authenticates to OIM and is only for use by Grid Admins for certificates they are authorized to approve. This script is only supported with all hosts being in the same domain (so we ensure they go to the same Grid Admin).
The certificates are stored with the format of 'hostname-requestid.pem' (i.e. the id generated from the request for the certificate).
The key is stored as 'hostname-serial-key.pem'.

This script does the following in the process of acquiring certificates for the hostnames specified:
   * Reads a list of fully-qualified hostnames from a file specified by the user.
   * For reach hostname:
   * Generates a new private key and CSR
   * Only important part of CSR is CN=<hostname> component
   * Writes the private key to a file with filename:
       <prefix>/<hostname>-key.pem
   * Prompts the user for their private key pass phrase
   * Pass phrase is cached so user is not re-prompted
   * Authenticates to OIM and posts the CSRs as a single request to OIM
   * Request id is returned and subsequently used
   * Authenticates to OIM and approves the request
   * Waits one minute for request to be processed by OIM
   * Connects to OIM and attempts to retrieve certificates
   * Writes out any certificates it retrieves with filename
        of <prefix>/<hostname>-<red-id>.pem
   * if all certificates have been retrieved, exits loop
   * Wait 5 seconds and repeat.

*Inputs:*
   * filename of list of hostnames
   * prefix path in which to write private keys and certificares [default: .]
   * path to user's certificate [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_CERT environment variable, ~/.globus/usercert.pem]
   * path to user's private key [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_KEY environment variable, ~/.globus/userkey.pem]
   * Passphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.

*Outputs:*
   * N host certificates in PEM format
   * N private keys in PEM format

----++++ osg-user-cert-renew

*Available only from OSG CLI Version 1.2*

Sends a request for renewing a user certificate and if the certificate can be renewed, fetches and writes the renewed certificate.

The script generates request for renewing user certificate to the OSG PKI, and if the certificate is renewed, it fetches the renewed user certifcate. The user is authenticated before making such a request. If the user certificate is renewed, the user gets email notification regarding the same and the renewed certificate is saved by the name of the existing certificate,and the existing certificate is moved to a new file with "-old" added to its file name.

*Inputs:*

   * filename to store private key [Optional, default is ./hostkey.pem]
   * path to user's certificate [Optional, default is path specified by $X509_USER_CERT environment variable, ~/.globus/usercert.pem]
   * path to user's private key [Optional, default is path specified by $X509_USER_KEY environment variable, ~/.globus/userkey.pem]
   * Passphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.
   * User needs to provide VO name if the requested hostname has multiple VO's assigned


*Outputs:*

   * On Renewal, the renewed certificate is stored with the filename of the older user certificate, 
     moving the existing user certificate to the format filename + "-old.pem" 
     the certificate name for renewed certificate is sent to stdout.

*Important Note: If the retrieval of user certificate fails for some reason, the user can download the renewed certificate from OIM !WebUI using the following URL, where !ReqID is the !requestID# for the user certificate on OIM:*

<verbatim>
https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificateuser?id=ReqID

</verbatim>

---+++ Installing from Source

The source code is available directly at:

<verbatim>
svn checkout https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/osg-cert-scripts-v3/
</verbatim>

To run the scripts directly from the source checkout, you need to install simplejson and !M2Crypto:

<verbatim>
pip install simplejson M2Crypto
</verbatim>

For older versions of python (2.4 at least), you will also need to install the python ssl module, which requires the openssl-devel RPM:

<verbatim>
sudo yum install openssl-devel gcc python-devel
sudo pip install ssl
</verbatim>

Then you can run the scripts as follows:

<verbatim>
cd trunk   # or, e.g., branches/1.1
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`  # to allow python to find the 'osgpkitools' module
cd osgpkitools  # so scripts can find pki-clients.ini
python ./osg-cert-request -h  # And you should see help message
</verbatim>

---+++ Test Mode

The scripts have two modes of execution.

In the normal mode of execution, the script connects to the production server and generated certificates are from the !DigiCert-Grid Grid-Only Trust CAs.

If the user provides a '-T' parameter on the command-line, the scripts connect to the OIM-ITB server and any generated certificates are issued by the !DigiCert-Grid Test CAs. This mode is intended for testing and training. The resulting certificates are not usable in a production environment.

For more information on both CAs, please see http://www.digicert-grid.com/

---+++ Current Limitations and Bugs

---++++ Common Name 64-character Limit

Note that Common Names (CNs) are limited to 64 characters. This is a limitation of !OpenSSL and the PKI standard. For details see [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-252][OSGPKI-252]].
