---+ Known problems in the OSG RPM installation
%TOC%

---++ Problems with Java

Due to problems with Java packaging,  you must pre-install the =jdk= RPM and disable GPG checking while installing it. It is high priority for us to solve this problem soon.

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-testing --nogpgcheck install jdk
</pre>

---++ Uninstall old version of osg-ca-certs

If you've previously installed osg-ca-certs from the older software.grid.iu.repository, please remove it before starting your installation to avoid conflicts.

We hope to have a smoother transition that doesn't requires you do to this, but for now you need to remove the old RPM.
