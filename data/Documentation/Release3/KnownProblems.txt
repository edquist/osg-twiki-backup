---+ Known problems in the OSG RPM installation
%TOC%

---++ Mixing rpm and pacman based CE installs causes problems
If a rpm based CE is installed on a system with a pacman installation, the pacman installation will use binaries installed by the rpms.  Therefore, switching back from the rpm based CE installation to the pacman installation is non trivial and will require removing rpms and making further changes to the configuration files in /etc.  Due to the changes needed, going back to the pacman installation may not be possible without reinstalling the OS.

---++ Using new VOMS clients with older VOMS servers
The new VOMS clients (such as =voms-proxy-init=) need to contact VOMS servers. Unfortunately, they do not work with the oldest VOMS servers. It works with both current and recent versions, but not much older versions. In particular, it doesn't work with the VOMS servers hosted by Fermilab and the GOC. Upgrades for these servers are scheduled for the near future. 

---++ GIP ownership
Your CE installation may have the wrong ownership on some directories. Fix this by doing:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown tomcat /var/log/gip
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown tomcat /var/cache/gip
</pre>

#SetWNPath
---++ Mixing Pacman-based CE with RPM-based worker nodes

If you have a Pacman-based CE with RPM-based worker nodes, you need to tweak your CE, particularly if you use Condor. In particular, you want to ensure that the PATH is set so that the jobs can find the standard tools. With the old worker node, the jobs relied on =setup.sh=, which no longer exists. (Actually, it exists but is empty.) The new CE sets the PATH, but the default PATH for Condor is empty. You can edit =$VDT_LOCATION/etc/config.ini" to add a line to your local settings:

<pre class="file">
[Local Settings]
%RED%PATH=/bin:/usr/bin%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

You do not need to do this if you have an RPM-based CE because it will be done automatically.

---++ Problems with EPEL and/or yum-priorities

When you install, you might see errors like this:
<pre class="screen">
Error: Missing Dependency: libglobus_gss_assist.so.3()(64bit) is needed by package CGSI-gSOAP-1.3.4.2-2.el5.x86_64 (epel-x86_64)
Error: Missing Dependency: libglobus_gsi_credential.so.1()(64bit) is needed by package lcgdm-1.8.1.2-1.el5.x86_64 (epel-x86_64)
Error: Missing Dependency: libglobus_gsi_callback.so.0()(64bit) is needed by package lcgdm-1.8.1.2-1.el5.x86_64 (epel-x86_64)
Error: Missing Dependency: libglobus_gssapi_gsi.so.4()(64bit) is needed by package lcgdm-1.8.1.2-1.el5.x86_64 (epel-x86_64)
...
</pre>

There are two possible reasons for this:

   1. You didn't install =yum-priorities=. Our instructions include this step, and it's essential in order to avoid this problem.
   1. For some reason, you pre-installed portions of Globus from the EPEL repository. Because we have a significantly newer (and better!) version of Globus in our repository, there are hard-to-resolve conflicts. You have to remove the old version of Globus before you proceed with the install. (And install =yum-priorities=.) To be clear, if you have pre-installed any of the following package from the EPEL repository, they should be removed:
      * Packages beginning with =globus=
      * CGSI-gSOAP
      * lcgdm
      * voms
      * Maybe others we aren't yet aware of.

You can remove them with a command such as:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -e --nodeps %RED%packagename%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---++ Uninstall old version of osg-ca-certs

If you've previously installed osg-ca-certs from the older software.grid.iu.repository, please remove it before starting your installation to avoid conflicts.

We hope to have a smoother transition that doesn't requires you do to this, but for now you need to remove the old RPM. 

---++ Old versions of Condor

Several of the RPMs in our repository depend on Condor. These include:

   * The Gratia Condor probes
   * The Condor job managers
   * glexec (just depends on the =condor_procd=, _not_ all of Condor)
   * RSV

If you don't have Condor installed, these will install Condor from our software repository. If you've installed Condor 7.6.0 or later from RPMs, your version will be used. However, if you've installed Condor 7.4.x or earlier from RPMs, it will appear not to satisfy the dependencies and our version of Condor will be installed. For now there is no good way around this--you must install Condor 7.6.0 or later if you need Condor. 

In the case of glexec, it's not just RPM dependencies that are not resolved--it reuqires a =condor_procd= from Condor 7.6.0 or later to work. Condor 7.4.x will _not_ work.

---++ No LSF support

There is not yet a Globus GRAM job manager for LSF. We expect one, but it might be a while.

---++ Java upgrade

You may see the following set of error messages while upgrading the =jdk= package:
<pre>
Unpacking JAR files...
rt.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/rt.pack
jsse.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/jsse.pack
charsets.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/charsets.pack
tools.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/lib/tools.pack
localedata.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/ext/localedata.pack
plugin.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/plugin.pack
javaws.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/javaws.pack
deploy.jar...
Error: Could not open input file: /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_26/jre/lib/deploy.pack
</pre>
These are completely harmless and can be ignored.

---++ RPM-based CE and running with the OSG glideinWMS factory

The OSG glideinWMS factory explicitly disables the GT5 auto-detection logic.  If you switch a CE from GT2 to GT5 and support VOs that use the factory, you should file a GOC ticket requesting the factory change your site to GT5.

---++ New Globus 5 CE needs Condor-G 7.6.x or later

The new Globus 5 based CE is only mostly backward compatible with GRAM2 CEs.

Newer versions of Condor-G (7.6.X and up) properly handle the difference, but older versions only work correctly if they specific that the CE is "gt5". If they specify that the CE is "gt2", they may find that they are are limited to 10 jobs total on each of the new Globus 5 CEs. (We haven't had consistent results with this--in some cases it seems to work, while in others there was this limit.)

---++ ROCKS provides a bad version of libtool

Globus requires libltdl.so.3 to function; ROCKS provides a copy of this in a non-system directory.  This satisfies the RPM requirement, but breaks Globus clients on ROCKS worker nodes.

For now, ROCKS administrators should manually verify that the RPM "libtool-ltdl" is present on all systems.
