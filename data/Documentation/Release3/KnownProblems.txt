---+ Known problems in the OSG RPM installation
%TOC%

---++ Problems with Java

Due to problems with Java packaging,  you must pre-install the =jdk= RPM and disable GPG checking while installing it. It is high priority for us to solve this problem soon.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-testing --nogpgcheck install jdk
</pre>

---++ Uninstall old version of osg-ca-certs

If you've previously installed osg-ca-certs from the older software.grid.iu.repository, please remove it before starting your installation to avoid conflicts.

We hope to have a smoother transition that doesn't requires you do to this, but for now you need to remove the old RPM. 

---++ Old versions of Condor

Several of the RPMs in our repository depend on Condor. These include:

   * The Gratia Condor probes
   * The Condor job managers
   * glexec (just depends on the _condor_procd=, _not_ all of Condor)
   * RSV

If you don't have Condor installed, these will install Condor from our software repository. If you've installed Condor 7.6.0 or later from RPMs, your version will be used. However, if you've installed Condor 7.4.x or earlier from RPMs, it will appear not to satisfy the dependencies and our version of Condor will be installed. For now there is no good way around this--you must install Condor 7.6.0 or later if you need Condor. 

In the case of glexec, it's not just RPM dependencies that are not resolved--it reuqires a =condor_procd= from Condor 7.6.0 or later to work. Condor 7.4.x will _not_ work.
