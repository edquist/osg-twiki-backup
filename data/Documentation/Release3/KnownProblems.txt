---+ Known problems in the OSG RPM installation
%TOC%

---++ Problems with Java

Due to problems with Java packaging, you can currently only use Scientific Linux (not CentOS or Red Hat Enterprise Linux), and you must pre-install the =jdk= RPM from the Scientific Linux repositories. It is high priority for us to solve this problem soon.

---++ Problems with Condor-G

The OSG software repositories contain Condor. We have used the Fedora source RPM to create this (not the Condor Team's binary RPM). It dynamically links against Globus. Currently (20-Sep-2011), Globus 5.2 has a problem that causes Condor-G submissions to fail when submitting jobs against older installations of Globus. This includes any currently deployed OSG CE. 

Three packages will install Condor if you haven't already installed it:

   * osg-ce-condor
   * osg-client-condor
   * rsv

To avoid problems, pre-install Condor before you install one of these packages. One possible way to pre-install Condor would be:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% yum install libvirt
%UCL_PROMPT% yum install 'perl(Date::Manip)'
%UCL_PROMPT% rpm -Uvh http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/yum/stable/rhel5/condor-7.6.3-1.rhel5.x86_64.rpm
</pre>

Yes this is ugly. Yes we hope there will be a real fix soon.
