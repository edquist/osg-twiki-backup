%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators and users. It provides information about the software installed on a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% and the services provided.

%NOTE% Instructions for installing a Compute Element can be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall][here]].

---+ Compute Element: Software and Services



---+ Installation locations

The OSG software installs software in locations that are given by the [[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/][FHS]].  Accordingly most binaries are located in =/usr/bin/= or =/usr/sbin/= .  Unlike with previous releases, you will not need to source a =setup.sh= script before working with VDT.    The configuration files are all in =/etc/= or subdirectories in there, with =osg-configure= and GIP using configuration files in =/etc/osg/config.d= .  Log files are all located in =/var/log= or subdirectories within that directory. Also of note, output such as =osg-attributes.conf= are located in =/var/lib/osg=.  



---+ Services

The CE services installed by rpms by default place cron or startup scripts in the appropriate locations (e.g. =/etc/init.d=) but do not enable or start these services.  Admins can enable, start, and stop services using the =chkconfig= or =service= commands.  E.g. =chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on= or =service fetch-crl-cron start= or =service fetch-crl-cron stop= to enable, start, and stop the fetch-crl-cron service respectively.
