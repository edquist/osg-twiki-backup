---++Globus Error: 131

---+++Syntax:

=Globus error 131: the user proxy expired (job is still running)=

---+++Known causes:

The job did not complete before the user's proxy (certificate authentication) with the grid expired.  Doing condor_q you will show you the held job.

---+++Recommendations:

   * Renew your grid proxy and release the held jobs using Condor:

Example: 

<verbatim>
$ grid-proxy-init
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity: 
Creating proxy ........................................ Done
Your proxy is valid until: <date>
</verbatim>
<verbatim>
$ condor_release <job id or -all>
All jobs released.
</verbatim>

   * Prevention: The default grid proxy expires after 12 hours.  If a job is expected to run for longer than 12 hours, it is possible to specify the duration of a proxy using:

<verbatim>
$ grid-proxy-init -valid <hh:mm>
</verbatim>
