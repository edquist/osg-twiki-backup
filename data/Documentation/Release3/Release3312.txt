---+ OSG Software Release 3.3.12

*Release Date*: 2016-05-10

---++ Summary of changes

This release contains:
   * [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/osg-vo-config/releases/tag/release-66-2][VO Package v66]] - More OSG CA migrations
   * HTCondor-CE-BOSCO: Setup a CE with only SSH access to the cluster
      * The HTCondor-CE-Bosco is designed to make it easier to contribute opportunistic resources to the OSG.  With the HTCondor-CE-Bosco, an organization can setup a CE with only SSH access to the cluster, rather than the long list of requirements for a regular HTCondor-CE.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues
   * =condor_ce_q= does not show any jobs when run as root with =condor-8.5.4= from upcoming. Work around this by using =condor_ce_q -allusers= instead.

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
