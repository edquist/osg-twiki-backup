---++++ Ban a user DN from your site
---+++++ Sites using Gums 1.3
   * Go to the GUMS web interface
      * https://gums-host:8443/gums/
   * Add new  manual group called banned
      * Configuration -> User Groups -> Add
      * Select type = manual and provide name, description. Then save
   * Add this group to a “banned user group”
      * Click on Configuration 
      * Select the group from drop down menu and save
   * Add user FQAN to the banned group
      * Click on “Manual User Group Members” in “User Management” section
      * Click Add, select the appropriate “user group”
      * Add the user FQAN and save
      * NOTE: We have noticed that just banning DNs instead of FQANs does not appear to work.
   * Test the mapping from your CE
      * %gums-host mapUser "DN" (as su)
      * Only if the mapping returns null, the user is banned 

---+++++ Sites using Gums 1.2
   * No banning option is available directly in GUMS 1.2.x.
   * To ban users an upgrade to 1.3.x is required

---+++++ Sites using edg-mkgridmap
   * Update the edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf (in $VDT_LOCATION)
      * Add a line 'deny “DN”'  
      * Wild cards are also accepted
      * Regenerate grid-mapfile executing  edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
      * Log file can be generally found at edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log
   * Check your grid-mapfile and confirm that the DN has indeed been removed
