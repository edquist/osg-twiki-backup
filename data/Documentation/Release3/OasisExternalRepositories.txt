---+!! Procedures for handling OASIS externally-hosted Repositories

%TOC%


---+ About OASIS
OASIS is the OSG Application Software Installation Service.  It is the recommended method to install software on the Open Science Grid.  It is implemented using !CernVM !FileSystem (CVMFS) technology.  

---+ About this Document
This document describes the detailed procedures for dealing with CVMFS repositories that are part of the OASIS system but are not hosted at the OSG Global Operations Center (GOC).  Rather, they are hosted at the home institution of a Virtual Organization (VO).    The procedures include the steps performed by both the GOC and by the repository administrator.   If you are only interested in using an OASIS repository that is hosted at the GOC, see instead [[UpdateOasis]].
