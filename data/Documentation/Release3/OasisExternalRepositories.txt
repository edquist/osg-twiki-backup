---+!! Procedures for handling OASIS externally-hosted Repositories

%TOC%

<noautolink>


---+ About OASIS
OASIS is the OSG Application Software Installation Service.  It is the recommended method to install software on the Open Science Grid.  It is implemented using !CernVM !FileSystem (CVMFS) technology.  


---+ About this Document
This document describes the detailed procedures for dealing with CVMFS repositories that are part of the OASIS system but are not hosted at the OSG Global Operations Center (GOC).  Rather, they are hosted at the home institution of a Virtual Organization (VO).    The procedures include the steps performed by both the GOC and by the repository administrator.   If you are only interested in using an OASIS repository that is hosted at the GOC, see instead [[UpdateOasis]].

---+ Requirements: setting up a CVMFS repository server
This document doesn't cover requirements for the GOC computers since those are already set up.  The requirements for a CVMFS repository server are that it have installed cvmfs-server and cvmfs client, both version 2.1.15 or greater.  This requires using aufs, which is standard on Redhat EL5-based systems, but requires a modified kernel from CERN on Redhat EL6.  Also an apache httpd server needs to be enabled.  NOTE: multiple repositories can be hosted on the same machine.

This is the procedure for installing it on a Redhat EL5 system:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -i http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el5-release-latest.rpm
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install aufs cvmfs-server.x86_64 cvmfs.x86_64</pre>

This is the procedure for installing it on a Redhat EL6 system:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -i http://cvmrepo.web.cern.ch/cvmrepo/yum/cvmfs/EL/6/x86_64/cvmfs-release-2-4.el6.noarch.rpm
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -i http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg/3.2/osg-3.2-el6-release-latest.rpm
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install --enablerepo=cernvm-kernel --disablerepo=cernvm kernel aufs2-util cvmfs-server.x86_64 cvmfs.x86_64
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% reboot</pre>

In addition, apache needs to listen on port 8000 and be started.  Use these commands:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% echo Listen 8000 >>/etc/httpd/conf.d/cvmfs.conf
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig httpd on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service httpd start</pre>
Make sure that port 8000 is available to the internet through any firewalls.


---+ Procedure to add an externally-hosted repository to OASIS

   1. The VO representative chooses a name for the repository.  This should normally be either the name of the VO or be derived from it.  The name used as an example in this document is *reponame*.
   1. Using whatever mechanism is appropriate at their institution, the VO representative requests the local CVMFS repository administrator to create this repository called =reponame.opensciencegrid.org=.
   1. The repository administrator creates the repository with these commands where ownerid is the user id that will have write access:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cvmfs_server mkfs -o ownerid reponame.opensciencegrid.org
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% (echo Order deny,allow;echo Deny from all;echo Allow from 129.79.53.0/24) >/srv/cvmfs/reponame.opensciencegrid.org/.htaccess</pre>
      If you might be hosting any hardlinks that span directories (e.g. the git package), also do the following:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% echo "CVMFS_IGNORE_XDIR_HARDLINKS=true" >>/etc/cvmfs/repositories.d/reponame.opensciencegrid.org</pre>
      Verify that the repository is readable over http with the following command:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% wget -qO- http://localhost:8000/cvmfs/reponame.opensciencegrid.org/.cvmfswhitelist|cat -v</pre>
      That should print several lines including some gibberish at the end.
   1. The repository administrator next should create a [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/submit][GOC ticket]] asking that a repository be added to OASIS.  Give the name of the VO and the full URL of the repository (e.g. http://fully.qualified.domain:8000/cvmfs/reponame.opensciencegrid.org)
   1. TO BE COMPLETED
