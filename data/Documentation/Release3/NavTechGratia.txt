---+!! Gratia

Gratia is used for accounting of jobs and data transfers in OSG. There are individual _Gratia probes_ at sites that collect data as well as _Gratia services_ that collect data. Most sites send data directly to a central Gratia service, but sites can install a local Gratia service if they prefer. They can use the accounting data locally and also forward it to the central OSG Gratia service.
