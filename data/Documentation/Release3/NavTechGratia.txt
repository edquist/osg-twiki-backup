---+!! Gratia

Gratia is used for accounting of jobs and data transfers in OSG. There are individual _Gratia probes_ at sites that collect data as well as _Gratia services_ that collect data. Most sites send data directly to a central Gratia service, but sites can install a local Gratia service if they prefer. They can use the accounting data locally and also forward it to the central OSG Gratia service.

---++ Gratia Probes
Currently, there are 15 probes that can report to Gratia. The probes could be subdivided into several major categories:
   1. __Local Batch System probe__. A probe specific to  to the type of site's batch system is running at each grid site. It collects information about finished jobs. Condor, Torque(PBS), LSF, SGE and Slurm Batch Systems are supported. The probes are installed with installation of a Compute Element.
   1. __Transfer Probes__. A probe collects information about the file transfers from/to Storage installed at each grid site. GridFTP, dCache, xrootd, hadoop transfer probes are supported. A probe is installed with installation of a Storage Element.
   1. __Storage Probes__.A probe gathers information about physical and logical pools utilization of a Storage installed at each grid site.   dCache, xrootd, hadoop storage probe are supported. A probe is installed with installation of a Storage Element.
   1. __Worker Node Probes__.The probes that  may be installed on a worker node are ps-acctounting probe and glexec probes. ps-accounting probe collects unix accounting information about finished processes ran by user. Glexec probe reports information about identity  of the user running jobs via glidein pilot. More information about glexec could be found [[InstallGlexec][here]].
