---+ OSG Software release 3.0.10

*Release Date*: 10-Apr-2012

---++ Summary of Changes

   * SL6 support for the CE, VOMS, client, and SE. 
   * RSV 3.7.0 changelog
      * Core:
         * SOFTWARE-618 - implemented support for using legacy Globus proxies
         * SOFTWARE-530 - added metric configuration knob to skip ping check
      * Metrics:
         * SOFTWARE-600 - fixed a bug in the Gratia Condor probe that could not find condor_config_val when it was installed in a non-standard location outside the PATH
         * SOFTWARE-595 - changed the status of the local certificate checks to be a WARNING when the certificate's validity is 168>validity>24 hours.  The status will still be CRITICAL when it is valid for <24 hours.
         * Removed org.osg.batch.* metrics.  They did not work with OSG 3.
         * Removed some other old OSG 1.2 code from the packaging that was not used.
      * Consumers:
         * Implemented nagios-consumer for OSG 3.  Incorporated rsv2nagios.py and rsv2nsca.py in the new consumer.
         * Rewrote html-consumer and gratia-consumer to share code with the new nagios-consumer
         * SOFTWARE-519 - fixed a bug where a consumer could crash if the timestamp field in a record was empty
         * osg-configure now accepts the accounting_log_directory option for PBS.
   * Updated glexec, lcmaps and associated packages to be based on the latest versions released for Europe.  Biggest changes:
      * Syslog interface is much more consistent.  The number of default messages are reduced, and the levels match those defined by syslog.  The syslog facility can be changed so they can be redirected to a separate file by /etc/syslog.conf.
      * Glexec, upgraded from version 0.8.10 to version 0.9.6, has major new optional functionality in epilog scripts, although there's currently no plans in OSG to use them.  Signal handling was implemented, and many bugs were fixed.  [[http://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/mwsec/trunk/glexec/NEWS?revision=16281][Detailed NEWS]].
      * lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface, the globus callout, upgraded from version 0.1.4 to 0.2.4, adds some configuration options, fixes memory leaks, and fixes a bug in parsing /etc/lcmaps.db that the OSG distribution was accidentally benefitting by.  The OSG distribution eliminates lcas as a dependency of this so lcas is no longer installed at all.  [[http://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/mwsec/trunk/lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface/NEWS?revision=16151][Detailed NEWS]].
      * lcmaps, upgraded from 1.4.28 to 1.5.4, fixed segmentation faults and other bugs in addition to the major logging rework.  The OSG distribution made lcmaps.db more clean and made the VOMS credential check possible to be enabled though off by default.  [[http://ndpfsvn.nikhef.nl/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/mwsec/trunk/lcmaps/NEWS?revision=16233][Detailed NEWS]].
