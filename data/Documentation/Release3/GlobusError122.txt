---++Globus Error: 122

---+++Syntax:

=Globus error 122: could not read the job state file=

---+++Known causes:

This error occurs when it is unable to write the gram_job_state file, either because the disk is full or user quota have been enabled and used up.

---+++Recommendations:

Check the disk to make sure there is enough space (using df and quota) available for the user to write the state file (could be $GLOBUS_LOCATION/tmp/). If enough space is not available you may chose to clean up old temporary files.
