%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. It starts with an introduction on Firewalls and how those terms are translated for OSG software. Then a brief description of services provided by a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% will be given, followed by recommendations how to adjust the firewall for their correct operation. Servers have to worry about several ports while [[InstallOSGClient][OSG Client]] installations only have to worry about the =GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=, =GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE= and the Condor ports (=LOWPORT=, =HIGHPORT=).

This document also defines a Firewall table that can be included in other documents to specify the network requirements. You can find more about it in the [[Documentation.DocFormattingRules#Networking][formatting document]]. %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% showlink="Click here to show an example" }%  
To use the table, list the lines you desire in the table in the variable "lines", separated by commas with no spaces.

All the predefined lines are: 
gram,portrange,portsource,gridftp,srm,srm2,gsissh,voms,vomsadmin,gums,myproxy,condor,rsvin,rsvout,various

You can add custom lines using a backslash "\" after the include and adding your lines (remember the 2 "space" on each side to center the cell).
This prints the full table and a custom line:
<verbatim>
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation" section="FirewallTable"  lines="gram,portrange,portsource,gridftp,srm,srm2,gsissh,voms,gums,myproxy,condor,rsvin,rsvout,various"}% \
| HTTP |  tcp  |  80  |  %ICON{choice-yes}%  | | My custom HTTP server with special explanation |
</verbatim>
That results in:
%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.FirewallInformation" section="FirewallTable"  lines="gram,portrange,portsource,gridftp,srm,srm2,gsissh,voms,gums,myproxy,condor,rsvin,rsvout,various"}% \

---+ Introduction

Network traffic may be blocked by a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28networking%29][firewall]] for inbound and outbound traffic in dependence on host- and domain names, IP addresses, port numbers and protocols. In this document we distinguish between two types of firewalls:

   1 network firewalls administrated centrally and typically outside of your administrative domain
   1 host-based firewalls within your administrative domain

The protocol and port requirements for OSG software components are listed in the install documents and summarized below. Please provide them to the administrator of a _network firewall_ potentially blocking network traffic to your host. Next, follow the instructions to adjust the firewall settings on your host-based firewall.

---++ Introduction to firewalls
If you are familiar with ports and Firewalls you can skip this section.
An IP connection is identified by an address and ports. Here are some clarifications on the way ports are used on a host.

Let's assume to be on a host. Servers require incoming connections to one or more _well known port_ (port known a priori by the client contacting the server on that host)
Then both clients and servers may require a variable number of incoming or outgoing connections on arbitrary (ephemeral) ports.
If there is any kind of firewall allowing only limited connectivity, then the processes must have a known set of _outbound ephemeral ports_ (ephemeral ports that are allowed outbound connectivity) they can choose from to connect outside, and must have a known set of _inbound ephemeral ports_ (ephemeral ports that are allowed inbound connectivity) they can choose from to listen for callbacks. 

If a process on a host (client or server) is behind a firewall that is not transparent but is a NAT router or a proxy, e.g when the client/server resides on a private network like in Figure 2, then the set of inbound ephemeral ports is the one opened on the firewall (router/proxy), the address for the callbacks has to be the public address (probably the one of the router/proxy) and the router has to be configured to perform port forwarding both of the well known ports of servers behind it and of all the inbound ephemeral ports. As a consequence of this setup, all clients and servers on different hosts behind the same NAT router must use disjunct sets of ports (well known ports + inbound ephemeral ports).

Figure 1 shows a client (b) and a server (a) behind a host firewall or a transparent network firewall.

Figure 2 shows a client and a server on a private network behind a NAT router.
Red borders indicate port forwarding.
Note the position of the transversal mark (dark blue/green) on the ephemeral ports indicating where the port range is defined: outbound ports are on the host, inbound ports are on the NAT router (and can be different form the ports on the host they are forwarded to) because are the ones used by the program calling back the client/server, coming form the public network.

---++ Configuring the OSG software
The software installed/configured by OSG RPMs includes Globus, Condor, Web servers (Apache, Tomcat). These need to know Firewall related information and here is a summary of how to specify it.

A Firewall:
   * must open (or forward) the well known ports: the port number is mentioned in the network requirements for that specific software (see its install document).
   * can be configured with a range of inbound ephemeral ports and a range of outbound ephemeral ports that can be used by the software, depending on the software and network configuration. 
The software needs to be made aware of the network specifics (ports and host name) using its own mechanisms: generally configuration values or environment variables defined at the startup. Here is a summary:

| *Ports* | *Globus* | *Condor* | *Tomcat* | *Apache* |
| well known ports | varies | values in =condor_config= (1) | proxyPort (2) | =Listen= in =httpd.conf= (3) |
| inbound ephemeral ports | =GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE= | =HIGHPORT, LOWPORT= | | |
| outbound ephemeral ports | =GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE= | =HIGHPORT, LOWPORT= | | |
| public host name | =GLOBUS_NAME= | values in =condor_config= (1) | proxyName (2) | (3) |

Notes:
   1. Condor configuration files depend on ist installation and configuration, e.g. =/etc/condor/condor_config=. Generally host name and port are specified in the same entry, e.g. =COLLECTOR_HOST = $(CONDOR_HOST): 9618=,  and =CONDOR_HOST = public_name.domain= . See [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/][Condor's manual]]
   2. Tomcat's configuration file is =/etc/tomcat5/server.xml=. See [[http://tomcat.apache.org/][Tomcat's documentation]]
   3. Apache's main configuration file is =/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf=. The configuration may involve [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/][virtual hosts]], [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html][proxy]] and reverse proxy functionalities. See [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/][Apache's documentation]]

%NOTE% Host (and service) certificates must refer always to the public name, the one of the NAT router or the proxy if the host is behind them.

---+ Host-based Firewall Configuration

The default firewall configuration for !RedHat's iptables defines a stateful packet filter; no ports that are not explicitly opened by =iptables= will be open. This includes high numbered ports that are often used by grid services. 

If your preference is to leave as much of the stateful packet filtering in place but enable just those grid services you want to deploy, then you can use the following instructions. On RHEL or similar systems the firewall is configured using the =/etc/sysconfig/iptables= file:

(You might want to change the name to be something more appropriate on your system, such as RH-Firewall-1-INPUT on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems or INPUT on Scientific Linux systems. Model the rules after the ones already existing in your =iptables= file.)

<pre class="file">
# GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
-A OSG-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport %RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%:%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR% -j ACCEPT
# GRAM
-A OSG-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2119 -j ACCEPT
# Gridftp
-A OSG-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2811 -j ACCEPT
# Optional Services
# MyProxy
-A OSG-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 7512 -j ACCEPT
# GSISSH/SSH
-A OSG-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
# GUMS/VOMS
-A OSG-INPUT  -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
</pre>

%NOTE% Please open the range of [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Define_Globus_Port_Ranges][Globus Ports]] according to your Compute Element configuration. 

Finally restart the firewall as the _root_ user for changes to take effect:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables restart
  Flushing firewall rules:                                   [  OK  ]
  Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter                    [  OK  ]
  Unloading iptables modules:                                [  OK  ]
  Applying iptables firewall rules:                          [  OK  ]

%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload
  Reloading configuration:                                   [  OK  ] 
</pre>

---+ Stateful Firewalls

A [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateful_firewall][Stateful Firewall]] keeps track of the state of network connections. If a TCP connection is closed unexpectedly a stateful firewall will not know that it has been closed. In this case the operating system may allow programs to reuse the port number, but the firewall will not.

To avoid using the same ports too quickly, and hopefully avoid the situation where a stateful firewall will not allow a port to be reused. The %LINK_GLOBUS_TOOLKIT% keeps a record of TCP ports using two files which are defined by two environment variables.

%STARTSECTION{"EnvConfig"}%
You should create =/etc/profile.d/globus_firewall.sh=, similar to what's below. (A future version of osg-configure will do this for you.)

<pre class="file">
# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for outbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE=%RED%&lt;location on file system&gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for inbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE=%RED%&lt;location on file system&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

and for the TCShell in =/etc/profile.d/globus_firewall.csh= :

<pre class="file">
# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for outbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE_STATE_FILE %RED%&lt;location on file system&gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE to the location where Globus should record
# TCP port usage for inbound connections in case of a %RED%stateful firewall%ENDCOLOR%.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE_STATE_FILE %RED%&lt;location on file system&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"EnvConfig"}%

---+ All firewalls (host-based and stateful)

These are configurations you can use to set environment variables such that services and users know about the firewall configuration. A future version of =osg-configure= will do these for you.

---++ Globus gatekeeper (for the OSG Compute Element)

Edit /etc/sysconfig/globus-gatekeeper to add:
<pre class="file">
# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE to define communication ports for outbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE to define communication ports for inbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---++ Globus !GridFTP:

Edit /var/lib/osg/globus-firewall to add:
<pre class="file">
# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE to define communication ports for outbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE to define communication ports for inbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---++ User environments
You can tell configure the user environment by editing two files:

=/etc/profile.d/globus_firewall.sh=

<pre class="file">
# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE to define communication ports for outbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE to define communication ports for inbound connections.
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

=/etc/profile.d/globus_firewall.csh= 
<pre class="file">
# Set GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE to define communication ports for outbound connections.
setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE %RED%&lt;begin port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%,%RED%&lt;end port&gt;%ENDCOLOR%

# Set GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE to define communication ports for inbound connections.

<!-- These wrappers seem not to be needed anymore
--+ Additional Steps for Scientific Linux

Scientific Linux uses =/etc/hosts.deny= to block all connections requests. Please add following lines to =/etc/hosts.allow= to open access to %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRIDFTP% and %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%:

<pre class="file">
  %UCL_CWD%/vdt/services/vdt-run-gsiftp.sh : ALL
  %UCL_CWD%/vdt/services/vdt-run-globus-gatekeeper.sh : ALL
</pre>
-->

---+ Testing and Monitoring

Use =telnet= to check whether the ports required are accessible on your %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% or %LINK_GLOSSARY_SE% by trying to connect to the respective TCP port from the outside:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% telnet &lt;the FQDN of the CE or SE&gt; &lt;port number to check&gt;
</pre>

The port is accessible if you get a response. Otherwise =telnet= will hang or report a _no route to host_ error.

If you configured =iptables= to log events, you should be able to see blocked events by inspecting =/var/log/messages=.
