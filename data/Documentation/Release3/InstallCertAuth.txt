---+ Installing CA Certificate Authorities with RPMs 

---++ Background

When installing software with RPMs, you need to decide how you want to install the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates. You might ask "why do I care? Can't you just give them to me?" We can, but you have a few things to consider:

   * What set of CA certificates do you want? How much control do you want over the set of CA certificates? (Some sites might not want to install specific CAs for policy or security reasons.)
   * How do you want to update them? 
   * Do you want to centrally manage the CA certificates or install them on each computer at your site?

You have four options for installing CA certificates:

   1. Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates. 
   1. Install =osg-update-certs=, a program that lets you install/update a predefined set of CA certificates, then adjust the set by adding or deleting specific CAs.
   1. Install an RPM that installs *no* CAs. This is useful when you want your RPM installations to succeed (because our RPMs require CA certificates, and this RPM satisfies that dependency) but you want to manage them with your own technique. 
   1. Make no choice, let =yum= decide for you.

---++ Option 1: Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates

If you want to install an RPM for one of our predefined CA certificates, you have two choices to make:

*Choice 1: Which set of CAs?*
   a. (_recommended_) The OSG CA certificates. This is similar to the IGTF set, but may have a small number of additions or deletions. 
   a. The default [[http://www.igtf.net/][IGTF]] CA certificates.

*Choice 2: Which format?*
   a. (_recommended_) A format compatible with both !OpenSSL 0.9.x and !OpenSSL 1.0
   a. A format only compatible with !OpenSSL 0.9.x. This may be important if you have installed programs that don't understand the newer format. 

Depending on your choice, you select one of four RPMs:

%TABLE{ sort="off" valign="top" }%
| *Set of CAs* | *Format* | *RPM name* | *Installation command (as root)* |
| OSG | !OpenSSL-both | osg-ca-certs | =yum install osg-ca-certs= | 
| OSG | !OpenSSL 0.9.x | osg-ca-certs-compat | =yum install osg-ca-certs-compat= | 
| IGTF | !OpenSSL-both | igtf-ca-certs | =yum install igtf-ca-certs= | 
| IGTF | !OpenSSL 0.9.x | igtf-ca-certs-compat | =yum install igtf-ca-certs-compat= | 

---++ Option 2: Install osg-update-certs

(In the Pacman world, this was vdt-update-certs).

Install this with: <pre class=screen>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-ca-scripts</pre>

You have the same choices for CA certificates as above. In order to choose, you will run osg-ca-manage, which will install the CA certificates. Then (if desired) you need to enable periodic updating of the CA certificates. 

%TABLE{ sort="off" valign="top" }%
| *Set of CAs* | *Format* | *CA certs name* | * Installation command (as root)* |
| OSG | !OpenSSL-both | osg-new | =/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg-new= | 
| OSG | !OpenSSL 0.9.x | osg-old | =/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg-old= | 
| IGTF | !OpenSSL-both | igtf-new | =/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url igtf-new= | 
| IGTF | !OpenSSL 0.9.x | igtf-old | =/usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url igtf-old= | 

Here is an example:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /usr/sbin/osg-ca-manage setupCA --location root --url osg-new 
Setting up CA Certificates for OSG installation
CA Certificates will be installed into /etc/grid-security/certificates
osg-update-certs
  Log file: /var/log/osg-update-certs.log
  Updates from: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version-new

Will update CA certificates from version unknown to version 1.21NEW.
Update successful.

Setup completed successfully.
</pre>

Initially the CA certificates will not be updated. You can tell by looking at:

<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  status
Periodic osg-update-certs is disabled.</pre>

You can enable the =cron= job that updates the CA certs with:
<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service osg-update-certs-cron  start
Enabling periodic osg-update-certs:                        [  %GREEN%OK%ENDCOLOR%  ]</pre>

For now, we don't have further documentation on figuring these scripts, but the =osg-ca-manage= command in your interface to adding and removing CAs. 

---++ Option 3:  Install an RPM that installs no CAs
Install this with: <pre class=screen>yum install no-ca-certs</pre>

%RED%*Warning:*%ENDCOLOR% If you choose this option, you are responsible for installing the CA certificates yourself. You must install them in =/etc/grid-security/certificates=, or make a symlink from that location to the directory that contains the CA certificates. 

---++ Option 4: Make no choice, let yum decide for you
If you use =yum= to install software that requires CA certificates but you haven't made one of these choices, yum will choose a default. Right now, it is Option #1 from above (_Install an RPM for a specific set of CA certificates_), and the osg-ca-certs RPM is chosen.
