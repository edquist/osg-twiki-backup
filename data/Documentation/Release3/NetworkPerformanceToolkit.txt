%ICON{"hand"}% This document is for System Administrators and advanced Grid Users. It describes the usage of tools provided by the %LINK_VDT% to evaluate the network performance between resources.

---+ Introduction

The %LINK_NPT% is a collection of applications provided by %LINK_INTERNET2% and distributed by the %LINK_VDT%. The _server_ components of the Network Performance Toolkit have been installed on dedicated resources of the %LINK_OSG%. Following _client_ tools are described in this document:

   * %NDT%
   * %OWAMP%
   * %BWCTL%
   * %NPAD%

---+ Installation

---++ Client Site Installation

The %LINK_NPT% is installed with the [[InstallOSGClient][OSG Client]]. Specifically, the tools included are: BWCTL, NDT and OWAMP. NPAD is currently not in OSG client. After installing the OSG Client, NPAD can be installed via yum, e.g.: <pre class="rootscreen">
yum install npad</pre>

Alternatively, you may install these utilities separately as RPM using yum by following the %LINK_INTERNET2% instructions. The packages are in the OSG repository and are (replace ARCH with your architecture, i386 or x86_64): 
   * NDT: ndt.ARCH
   * OWAMP: owamp-client.ARCH
   * BWCTL: bwctl.ARCH, bwctl-client.ARCH, bwctl-server.ARCH
   * NPAD: npad.ARCH


---++ Server Site Installation

The %LINK_PERFSONAR%-based tools and services support the following tasks for OSG VO's:

   1 monitor site-to-site network paths and ensure that these paths remain operational
   1 troubleshoot performance problems quickly and efficiently

The <i>server site components</i> can be brought-up _on demand_ using the [[http://software.internet2.edu/pS-Performance_Toolkit/pS-Performance_Toolkit-LiveCD-3.2.iso][Live CD]] provided by %LINK_INTERNET2%. Source packages are provided on the [[http://www.perfsonar.net/][perfSonar home page]].

Once the Toolkit server has booted you may begin on-demand testing. The server tools will use a generic set of configuration files.  The intent is to make it easy to stand up a temporary server when and where it is needed.  However, it is expected that a permanently installed server will be customized/configured, allowing it to support both on-demand testing and regularly scheduled monitoring.  See the [[http://www.perfsonar.net/][perfSonar home page]] for step-by-step instructions on how to complete this customization process.

---+ Finding Target Servers

Finding servers against which to run on-demand tests can be a major impediment to effectively using these tools.  The [[http://www.perfsonar.net/][perfSONAR]] project tackles this problem by running a registration service for participating tools.  The Performance Node ISO automatically uses this Lookup Service to advertise the tools' existence.  You can also create custom views by making web-service calls to retrieve the data of interest.  See the [[http://www.perfsonar.net/][perfSONAR home page]] for more details.

---+ Using the Client Tools

The <i>client site components</i> are installed with the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client]] (see above). These tools support delay measurements (OWAMP), throughput measurements (BWCTL), and advanced diagnostics (NDT and NPAD).  The command syntax for each tool is described in the following sub-sections. Each of the client tools listed above communicates with a companion server process to perform a measurement/test.

---++ %NDT%

The %NDT% runs a series of short tests to determine what the current performance is and what, if anything, is limiting that performance.  It can distinguish between host configuration and network infrastructure problems.  To diagnose the CE/SE configuration and network connection run the =web100clt= command:

<pre class="screen">

---++ %OWAMP%

The %OWAMP% is an advanced version of the common =ping= program.  The OWAMP client =owping= communicates with an OWAMP server and measures the delay in each direction using NTP based time stamps.  OWAMP can be used to identify delay, loss, and packet reordering problems inside the network. To measure the delay between the CE/SE and the remote server use the =owping= command:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% owping %GREEN%&lt;Target Server for Measurement&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="screen">

%ENDTWISTY%
  
---++ %BWCTL%

The %BWCTL% is a wrapper for the =iperf= command. BWCTL improves the usability of =iperf= by avoiding following problems:

   1 need for remote access to the target host used for measurement
   1 security concerns about leaving an =iperf= daemon running on the target host

BWCTL supports testing in either direction, or between 2 remote BWCTL servers from a third location. To measure the current throughput from your SE/CE to the remote server use the =bwctl= command:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bwctl –s %GREEN%&lt;Target Server for Measurement&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%

---++ %NPAD%
      
The %NPAD% tool examines a host and its local network infrastructure to determine what problems, if any, would hinder wide area performance. Issues such as small TCP buffers in switches and routers are detected as well as common host configuration errors. To determine if the CE/SE will achieve maximum performance over a WAN path run the command =diag-client=:

<pre class="screen">

%NOTE% The last 2 numeric parameters are the rtt time and speed/rate values you need to achieve.
%NOTE% The =diag-client= commands return a partial URL, enabling easy sharing of results between users and site administrators. To view the results, prepend the Toolkit servers name/port to the returned string.  The example above would result in this URL: =http://server.this.osg.domain:8002/ServerData/Reports-2011-07/vtbv-ce.uchicago.edu:2011-07-12-18:50:07.html=.

---+ Advanced Topic: Scheduled Monitoring

In addition to the above on-demand tests, the Performance Toolkit server can be configured to continuously monitor the throughput or delay between your site and peer sites of interest.  To begin this monitoring, enter the GUI and ensure that your server is a member of the community or communities of interest.  Once that is complete, continue on by selecting either the *perfSONAR-BUOY* throughput or delay configuration menu item.  

pSB-throughput:  This utility will run regularly scheduled BWCTL tests between your Toolkit server and the selected peer servers.  Results are stored in a database and displayed on the server's web page.  You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers.  This would allow monitoring of a common core infrastructure at a central site, while each site could keep local/customized views.
