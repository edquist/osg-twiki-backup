---+++ Installation Guides: RSV

RSV is used to monitor your site. It is useful for you understand your site, and it shares data with the rest of OSG so it can be published. Some data is shared with the WLCG if your site participates in the WLCG.

In the past, RSV used to be part of the compute element installation. These days it can be installed separately.
