---++ Known Issues
   * The configuration file for !GlideinWMS depends on a bug that was fixed in HTCondor version 8.4.7 (and 8.5.5 in upcoming). Unfortunately, this incompatibility was not discovered before HTCondor was released. This affects all !GlideinWMS submit hosts running HTCondor 8.4.7 or 8.5.5. It does not affect the factory, it will affect the fronted only if it is used also to submit jobs. In the configuration file =/etc/condor/config.d/02_gwms_schedds.config=, the following lines:\
<pre class="file">
JobAdInformationAttrs = $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) 
SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) JobAdInformationAttrs
</pre>\
Should be replaced by:\
<pre class="file">
if version <= 8.4.6
    JobAdInformationAttrs = $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) 
    SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) JobAdInformationAttrs
elif version >= 8.5.0
    if version <= 8.5.4
        JobAdInformationAttrs = $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) 
        SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) JobAdInformationAttrs
    elif version == 8.5.5
        JobAdInformationAttrs = "$(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS)" 
        SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) +JobAdInformationAttrs
    else
        JobAdInformationAttrs = "$(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS)" 
        SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) JobAdInformationAttrs
    endif
elif version == 8.4.7
    JobAdInformationAttrs = "$(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS)" 
    SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) +JobAdInformationAttrs
else
    JobAdInformationAttrs = "$(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS)" 
    SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_ATTRS) $(JOB_GLIDEIN_SITEWMS_ATTRS) JobAdInformationAttrs
endif

</pre>

   * =condor_ce_q= does not show any jobs when run as root with =condor-8.5.5= from upcoming. Work around this by using =condor_ce_q -allusers= instead.

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
