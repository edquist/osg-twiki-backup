---++ About This Document
This document introduces package management tools that help you install, update, and remove packages. This article focuses on the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM), which was developed by Red Hat, as well as the Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM), which was originally developed to manage Red Hat Linux systems at Duke University's Physics department.  YUM adds automatic updates and package management, including dependency management, to RPM systems. In addition to understanding the installed packages on a system, YUM, like the Debian Advanced Packaging Tool (APT), works with repositories, which are collections of packages, typically accessible over a network connection.

---++ Set Up Repository Locations

---++ Installation

---++ Verifying Packages and Installations
