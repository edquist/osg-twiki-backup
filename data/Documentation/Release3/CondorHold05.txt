---++Condor Hold Code 5

---+++Known causes:

Hold Code 5 indicates that a periodic hold expression was UNDEFINED and so the job was placed on hold.

---+++Recommendations:

Fix the job so that periodic hold expressions are never UNDEFINED or attempt to continue by doing condor_release -&lt;jobid&gt;
