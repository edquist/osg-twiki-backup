The applicable software versions for this document are %RED%OSG Version >= 3.0 %ENDCOLOR%.  The version of glexec installed should be %RED% >= 0.8.10 %ENDCOLOR%.

---+ About Glexec

Glexec is commonly used for what are referred to as "pilot" or "glidein" jobs.  

Traditionally, users submitted their jobs directly to a remote site (or compute element gatekeeper).   The user job was authenticated/authorized to run at that site based on the user's proxy credentials and run under the local unix account assigned.

In a pilot-based infrastructure, users submit their jobs to a centralized site (or queue).   The pilot/glidein software at the centralized site then recognizes there is a demand for computing resources.  It will then submit what is called a pilot/glidein job to a remote site.  This pilot job gets authenticated/authorized to run on a worker node in that site's cluster.  It will then "pull" down user jobs from the centralized queue and execute them.  Both the pilot and the user job are run under the pilot job's proxy certificate credentials and local unix account. This represents a security problem in pilot-based systems as there is no authentication/authorization of the individual user's proxy credentials and, thus, the user's jobs do not run using it's own local unix account.

Glexec is a security tool that can be used to resolve this problem.   It is meant to be used by VOs that run these pilot-based jobs.  It  has a number of authentication plugins and can be used both by EGEE LCAS/LCMAPS and by OSG with GUMS and optionally SAZ.   

The pilot job will "pull" user jobs down from the central queue and invoke glexec which will then 
   1 authenticate the user job's proxy, 
   1 perform an authorization callout (GUMS/SAZ in the case of OSG) similar to that done by the gatekeeper,
   1 and then run the user job under the local account assigned by the authorization service (for OSG, this is GUMS) for that user.

In effect, glexec functions much the same as a compute element gatekeeper, except these functions are now performed on the individual worker node.  The pilot jobs authentication/authorization is done by the gatekeeper and the individual user jobs are now done by glexec on the individual worker node.

Many worker node clusters use shared file systems like NFS for much of their software and user home accounts.  Since glexec is an suid program, it must be installed on every single worker node individually.  Most shared file systems do not handle this correctly so it cannot and must not be NFS-exported.

---+ Engineering Considerations
This section describes any prerequisite software/considerations that must be taken into account before the glexec software installation is performed.  It should be reviewed completely before starting the installation process.

   1 This document assumes that you have already gone through the instructions at InstallOSGClient.
   1 Unlike previous releases of OSG, this version only supports the XACML protocol of GUMS and SAZ.  This requires GUMS version to be >= ???? and the SAZ version to be >= ????.

---+ Requirements

THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN

These are the requirements that must be met before proceeding with the glexec installation:

   1 Local user "glexec".  You must create a <b>"glexec" local user</b> before you attempt the installation.   Glexec uses it for privilege separation and the installation will fail without it.
   1 Group ids for tracking purposes.  Glexec also requires a range of <b>group ids</b> for tracking purposes. 
      * Define at least 4 group ids per batch slot per worker node.   A conservative way to handle this is to multiply the number of batch slots on the largest worker node by 6 and then share the group ids between all the worker nodes.
      * They must be consecutive and in any range (default range is 65000-65049, configured in post-install section below).   
      * The same group ids can be used on every worker node.
   1 CA Certificates.  Remember to install the CA Certificates as for every VDT install.  Follow the instructions in CaCertificatesInstall.
   1 A host cert or proxy on every node.  Each worker node which is executing =glexec= needs to have either a host certificate or a host proxy distributed from the gatekeeper.  If you don't have host certificates for the worker nodes, there is a host proxy distribution script located at  =http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/files/glexec/host_dist_latest.tgz= which can be installed on your gatekeeper and will automatically create a proxy from your gatekeeper's host certificate and push it out to =/etc/grid-security/hostproxy.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/hostproxykey.pem=.

---+ Installation Procedure

THIS SECTION NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN

<b>Glexec must be installed as root</b>.

It is recommended that the glexec package be installed within the OSG Worker Node Client area because most of its dependencies are the same 
as those within the worker node client.   It must be installed in the *same*  location on all worker nodes managed by the same Compute Element.
The reason for this is that the location of the glexec executable is defined on the CE. Details are described in the  [[GlexecInstall#Configuring_the_CE_node][Configuring the CE node section]] of this document.

To install:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Glexec
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source ./setup.sh
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-post-install
</pre>

%NOTE% The =setup.sh= file is not changed to put the =glexec= binary into your path.

After the =pacman= installation is complete, perform these checks:
   1 The install will create config files under =/etc/glexec= if the directory does not already exist.
   1 The install should have created the =/var/log/glexec= directory. If it does not exist, create it with 555 permissions with root owner/group.
      * dr-xr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 29 03:32 /var/log/glexec
   1 Verify that the  =VDT_LOCATION/glexec-osg/sbin/glexec= binary has =suid= permissions. If it does not, check the =vdt_install.log= and the =post-install/README= file to see it sheds light on a problem.
      * -rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 157394 Jun 29 03:32 glexec.
