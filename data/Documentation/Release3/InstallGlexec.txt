---+ About Glexec

Glexec is commonly used for what are referred to as "pilot" or "glidein" jobs.  

Traditionally, users submitted their jobs directly to a remote site (or compute element gatekeeper).   The user job was authenticated/authorized to run at that site based on the user's proxy credentials and run under the local unix account assigned.

In a pilot-based infrastructure, users submit their jobs to a centralized site (or queue).   The pilot/glidein software at the centralized site then recognizes there is a demand for computing resources.  It will then submit what is called a pilot/glidein job to a remote site.  This pilot job gets authenticated/authorized to run on a worker node in that site's cluster.  It will then "pull" down user jobs from the centralized queue and execute them.  Both the pilot and the user job are run under the pilot job's proxy certificate credentials and local unix account. This represents a security problem in pilot-based systems as there is no authentication/authorization of the individual user's proxy credentials and, thus, the user's jobs do not run using it's own local unix account.

Glexec is a security tool that can be used to resolve this problem.   It is meant to be used by VOs that run these pilot-based jobs.  It  has a number of authentication plugins and can be used both by EGEE LCAS/LCMAPS and by OSG with GUMS and optionally SAZ.   

The pilot job will "pull" user jobs down from the central queue and invoke glexec which will then 
   1 authenticate the user job's proxy, 
   1 perform an authorization callout (GUMS/SAZ in the case of OSG) similar to that done by the gatekeeper,
   1 and then run the user job under the local account assigned by the authorization service (for OSG, this is GUMS) for that user.

In effect, glexec functions much the same as a compute element gatekeeper, except these functions are now performed on the individual worker node.  The pilot jobs authentication/authorization is done by the gatekeeper and the individual user jobs are now done by glexec on the individual worker node.

Many worker node clusters use shared file systems like NFS for much of their software and user home accounts.  Since glexec is an suid program, it must be installed on every single worker node individually.  Most shared file systems do not handle this correctly so it cannot and must not be NFS-exported.

---+ Engineering Considerations
This section describes any prerequisite software/considerations that must be taken into account before the glexec software installation is performed.  It should be reviewed completely before starting the installation process.

   1 Unlike previous releases of OSG, this version only supports the XACML protocol of GUMS and SAZ.  This requires the GUMS version to be >= 1.3 and the SAZ version to be >= 2.7.0.
   1 A large number of batch slots using glexec can occasionally put an enormous strain on GUMS and SAZ servers and cause overloading and client timeouts.   In order to survive peak loads, the sysctl parameter 'net.core.somaxconn' on a GUMS server machine should be set at least as high as the maximum number of job slots that might attempt to contact the server at about the same time.  (For example, Fermilab set the value to 4096 on each of two servers and tested with a continuous load from 5000 job slots).  At the same time, the Apache parameter 'ListenBacklog' must be changed to the same value.  SAZ servers should be set with the same 'net.core.somaxconn' sysctl value, and the corresponding Tomcat parameter 'acceptCount' must be set to the same value.  Also note that Fermilab determined that for best performance, the Apache parameter 'MaxClients' on GUMS servers (at least on their dual-core Virtual Machines) should be set to a value of 32.

---+ Requirements

These are the requirements that must be met on a worker node before proceeding with the glexec installation:

   1 The OSG worker node base software.  First install all the base software by following the instructions at InstallWNClient, including the instructions for CA Certificates.
   1 Local user "glexec".  If you want control over the local "glexec" user's uid and gid you should create it before you install the package.  If you don't create it, it will be automatically created.
   1 Group ids for tracking purposes.  Glexec also requires a range of <b>group ids</b> for tracking purposes.  You don't actually have to create the group entries but it is recommended to do so in order to reserve the gids and so they can be associated with names in the =/usr/bin/id= command.  The recommended names are 'glexecNN' where NN is a number starting from 00.
      * Define at least 4 group ids per batch slot per worker node.   A conservative way to handle this is to multiply the number of batch slots on the largest worker node by 6 and then share the group ids between all the worker nodes.
      * They must be consecutive and in any range (default range is 65000-65049, configured in [[#Post_install_Configuration_of_gl][post-install]] section below).   
      * The same group ids can be used on every worker node.
   1 A host cert or proxy on every node.  Each worker node which is executing =glexec= needs to have either a host certificate or a host proxy distributed from the gatekeeper.   The host certificates do not need to be unique on every node; you can share the same one for every host in the cluster.  If you don't have any host certificate for the worker nodes, there is a host proxy distribution script located at  =http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/files/glexec/host_dist_latest.tgz= which can be installed on your gatekeeper and will automatically create a proxy from your gatekeeper's host certificate and push it out to =/etc/grid-security/hostproxy.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/hostproxykey.pem=.  The script does assume the use of Kerberos, however, so it may not be applicable to your site or may need to be adapted.

---+ Installation Procedure

After meeting all the requirements in the previous section, install glexec with this command: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-testing install osg-wn-client-glexec </pre>

---+Post-install Configuration of glexec

The following steps need to be done after the glexec installation is complete.

   1 First, review the contents of =/etc/glexec.conf=.  All of the defaults should be fine, but if you want to change the behavior, the parameters are described in =man glexec.conf=.
   1 Next, review all of the contents of =/etc/lcmaps.db= and in particular update the following pieces.
      * Change the yourgums.yourdomain in the following line to the fully qualified domain name of your GUMS server:<pre class="file">
    "--endpoint https://yourgums.yourdomain:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort"
</pre>
      * If you have SAZ, change yoursaz.yourdomain in the following line to the fully qualified domain name of your SAZ server: <pre class="file">
    "--endpoint https://yoursaz.yourdomain:8443/saz/services/SAZXACMLAuthorizationServicePort"
</pre>
      * If you want to use a range of tracking group ids other than the default as described in the [[#Requirements][Requirements]] section above, uncomment and change the -min-gid and -max-gid lines to your chosen values: <pre class="file">
    "-min-gid 65000"
    "-max-gid 65049"
</pre>
      * Uncomment the following two lines: <pre class="file">
    glexectracking = "lcmaps_glexec_tracking.mod"
               "-exec /usr/sbin/glexec_monitor"
</pre>
      * If you do not have SAZ, uncomment the following policy toward the end of the file: <pre class="file">
verifyproxy -> gumsclient
gumsclient -> glexectracking
</pre>
        or if you do have SAZ, uncomment the following policy instead: <pre class="file">
verifyproxy -> sazclient
sazclient -> gumsclient
gumsclient -> glexectracking
</pre>

---+Testing the Installation of glexec

Now, __as a non-privileged user (not root)__ , do the following (where %RED%yourvo%ENDCOLOR% is your VO,  and %RED%NNN%ENDCOLOR% is your uid as reported by =/usr/bin/id=):
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%yourvo%ENDCOLOR%:/%RED%yourvo%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT=/tmp/x509up_u%RED%NNN%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT% /usr/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
uid=13160(fnalgrid) gid=9767(fnalgrid) groups=65000(glexec00)
</pre>
If =glexec= is successful, it will print out the uid and gid that your proxy would normally be mapped to by your GUMS server, plus a supplementary tracking group. (The actual names and numbers will be different from what you see above.)

---+ Glexec log files

=Glexec= sends all its log information by default to syslog.  Where it goes from there depends on your syslog configuration, but by default they go to =/var/log/messages=.  Here are some sample messages:  <pre class="file">
Oct 10 17:17:32 itb-c001 glexec[25238]: lcmaps.mod-lcmaps_startPluginManager(): initializing plugin /usr/lib64/modules/glexectracking (db entry 3)
Oct 10 17:17:32 itb-c001 glexec[25238]: lcmaps.mod-PluginInit(): plugin /usr/lib64/modules/glexectracking not found (arguments: )
Oct 10 17:17:32 itb-c001 glexec[25238]: lcmaps.mod-lcmaps_startPluginManager(): error initializing plugin: /usr/lib64/modules/glexectracking
</pre>
These particular messages are pretty common, caused by forgetting to uncomment the beginning of the glexectracking rule in =/etc/lcmaps.db=.


The syslog facility used is "daemon", and that's not configurable.  With standard syslog it isn't possible to separate out the glexec-related messages into its own separate file, but syslog-ng (available in the epel repository) can do it by matching all the messages that have the string "glexec" in the name.   These rules in =/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf= will separate the glexec messages into =/var/log/glexec.log=: <pre class="file">
destination d_glexec { file("/var/log/glexec.log"); };
filter f_glexec { program("^glexec"); };
filter f_notglexec { not program("^glexec"); };
log { source(s_sys); filter(f_glexec); destination(d_glexec); };
</pre>
Then later, in the log rule writing sending to "d_mesg," add a "filter(f_notglexec);" before the destination rule to keep glexec messages out of =/var/log/messages=: <pre class="file">
log { source(s_sys); filter(f_default); filter(f_notglexec); destination(d_mesg); };
</pre>
