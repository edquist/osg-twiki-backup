---+ HTCondor CE Overview

---++ Architecture

At the heart of the OSG Compute Element (CE) is the job gateway software, it is responsible for authenticating grid users' jobs and delegating them to a batch system that will then allocate resources for them. One of the options for a job gateway in the OSG is a piece of software called HTCondor-CE, which is a special configuration of the HTCondor software.

---+++ How Jobs Run

In the OSG, users submit jobs from HTCondor submit nodes to a job gateway on a site's CE. The CE checks credentials of the job owner, and if the owner is authorized to run at the site, the job is placed into the job gateway's scheduler and undergoes site-customizable transformations before it is submitted to the site's batch system. The job gateway monitors the status of the job on the batch system and passes that information back to the intial submit node until the job reaches completion, where the process ends.

The HTCondor-CE delegates jobs by having the client submit HTCondor jobs to a scheduler running on the CE.  We refer to this as the "grid job".  A separate daemon, the !JobRouter, is responsible for transforming the grid job to a format that the site's resource manager can consume. This job transformation happens according to sets of customizable "job routes" that can add, edit and remove attributes to jobs that meet specified criteria. We refer to the transformed job as the "routed job".

---++++ How jobs run on HTCondor batch systems

For a site with a HTCondor batch system, the !JobRouter will transform and mirror the grid job into the routed job in the site's batch system.  The process is illustrated below:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ce_condorbatchsystem.png" alt="condor-ce-condor-schematics.png" width='320' height='306' /> 

Notice the !JobRouter copies the job directly into the site's batch system and does not make use of =condor_submit=. This means that if the HTCondor batch system is setup to add attributes to incoming jobs when they are submitted (i.e. =SUBMIT_EXPRS=), these attributes will not be added to the routed jobs.

---++++ How jobs run on other batch systems

Submission into a non-HTCondor batch system is done slightly differently than with an HTCondor batch system. For example, with a PBS batch system, the routed job stays in the HTCondor-CE schedd (as the !JobRouter does not know how to submit directly into the PBS queue), and the routed job is submitted into PBS using the blahp daemon, resulting in the batch job. See the illustration below:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ce_otherbatchsystem.png" alt="condor-ce-condor-schematics.png" width='320' height='306' /> 

Notice the blahp, not the !JobRouter, does the submission to PBS in this case. The blahp daemon is a common piece of software for interacting with batch systems - in addition to being integrated in the HTCondor grid universe, it also is used by the BOSCO project and the CREAM CE.

---+++ How Security Works

Out-of-the-box, the HTCondor-CE defaults to GSI-based authentication and authorization (same as Globus GRAM), which will work with pre-existing GUMS servers or Grid mapfiles. Additionally, it can be reconfigured to provide alternate authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos, SSL, shared secret, or even IP-based authentication.

---++ Next steps

If you're transitioning from a GRAM CE to HTCondor CE, the process is the same as if you were setting up a completely new CE, whether you're installing it on a new machine or alongside your GRAM CE.
