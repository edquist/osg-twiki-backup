---+ HTCondor CE Overview

%TOC{depth="3"}%

---++ About this Document

This document serves as an introduction to HTCondor CE, how it works, and its differences with a GRAM CE. 

---++ Document Requirements

Before continuing with this document, make sure that you are familiar with the following concepts:

   * %RED%FIXME plan your site doc goes here%ENDCOLOR% 
      * What is a batch system and which one your site will be utilizing ([[Documentation/GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCondor][HTCondor]], PBS, LSF, or SGE)
      * Security in the OSG via [[Documentation/GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGridSecurityInfrastructure][GSI]] (i.e. [[Documentation/GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCA][Certificate authorities]], user and host [[Documentation/GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCertificate][certificates]], proxies)
   * Pilot jobs, frontends, and factories (i.e. [[Documentation/GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGlideinWMS][GlideinWMS]], !AutoPy)

---++ What is a Compute Element?

An OSG Compute Element (CE) is the entry point for the OSG to your local resources: a layer of software that you install on a machine that has the ability to submit jobs into your local batch system. At the heart of the CE is the _job gateway_ software, which is responsible for handling incoming jobs, authorizing them, and delegating them to your batch system for execution. Historically, the OSG only had one option for a job gateway solution, Globus Toolkit’s GRAM-based gatekeeper, but now offers the HTCondor CE as an alternative.

---++ What is HTCondor CE?

HTCondor CE is a special configuration of the HTCondor software designed to be a job gateway solution for the OSG. Out of the box, HTCondor supports the remote job submission and GSI-based authorization methods. To handle job delegation, HTCondor CE uses the [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.2/5_4HTCondor_Job.html][JobRouter daemon]], which transforms jobs and submits them to the batch system at your site. The OSG supports HTCondor, PBS, SLURM, LSF and SGE batch systems.

---+++ How is HTCondor CE different from a GRAM CE?

The biggest difference you will see between an HTCondor CE and a GRAM CE is the way that jobs are submitted to your batch system; HTCondor CE&rsquo;s use the built-in !JobRouter daemon whereas GRAM CE&rsquo;s use jobmanager scripts written in Perl. Customizing your site&rsquo;s CE now requires editing configuration files instead of editing jobmanager scripts.

Listed below are some other benefits to switching to HTCondor CE:

   * *Scalability:* HTCondor CE is capable of supporting job workloads of large sites (See scale tests [[Sandbox.HTCondorCEScaleTests][here]])
   * *Debugging tools:* HTCondor CE offers many tools to help [[TroubleshootingHTCondorCE][troubleshoot]] issues with jobs
   * *Routing as configuration:* HTCondor CE&rsquo;s mechanism to transform and submit jobs is customized via configuration variables. This means that customizations will survive through upgrades and system administrators will not have to modify software internals to route jobs to their destination.

---++ How Jobs Run

In the OSG, most incoming jobs (referred to as _grid jobs_) will be in the form of pilots submitted from the factories. Once a grid job is authorized, it is placed into HTCondor CE&rsquo;s scheduler, where the !JobRouter transforms it (referred to as the _routed job_) and submits it to the batch system (referred to as the _batch system job_). HTCondor CE monitors the status of the batch system job and passes that information back to the routed job, then to the grid job, and eventually to the user until the job completes, whereupon files are transferred back along the chain and the process ends.

---+++ On HTCondor batch systems

For a site with an HTCondor batch system, the !JobRouter transforms the grid job directly into the batch system&rsquo;s schedd i.e., the routed and batch system jobs are one and the same. This means that the are three job IDs (illustrated below): the job ID on the submit host, the grid job&rsquo;s ID on the CE, and the routed/batch system job ID.

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ce_condorbatchsystem.png" alt="condor-ce-condor-schematics.png" width='320' height='306' /> 

In an HTCondor CE/HTCondor setup, files are transferred from HTCondor CE&rsquo;s spool directory (specified by the =SPOOL= configuration variable) directly to the batch system&rsquo;s spool directory using internal HTCondor protocols.

%NOTE% The !JobRouter copies the job directly into the batch system and does not make use of =condor_submit=. This means that if the HTCondor batch system is configured to add attributes to incoming jobs when they are submitted (i.e. =SUBMIT_EXPRS=), these attributes will not be added to the routed jobs.

---+++ On other batch systems

For non-HTCondor batch systems, the !JobRouter transforms the grid job into the routed job on the CE and the routed job submits a job into the batch system via a process called the BLAHP. This means that there are four job IDs (illustrated below): the job ID on the submit host, the grid job&rsquo;s ID on the CE, the routed job&rsquo;s ID on the CE, and the batch system job ID. Although the following example specifies the PBS case, it applies to all non-HTCondor batch systems:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/ce_otherbatchsystem.png" alt="condor-ce-condor-schematics.png" width='320' height='306' /> 

With non-HTCondor batch systems, HTCondor CE cannot use internal HTCondor protocols to transfer files so its spool directory must be exported to a shared file system that is mounted on the worker nodes.

---++ How the CE is Customized

Aside from the [[Documentation.Release3/InstallHTCondorCE#Configuring_HTCondor_CE][basic configuration]] required in the CE installation, there are two main ways to customize your CE (if you decide any customization is required at all): 

   * Deciding which VOs are allowed to run at your site and 
   * How to filter and transform the grid jobs to be run on your batch system. 

The method of limiting the VOs that are allowed to run on your site has not changed between GRAM and HTCondor CE&rsquo;s: select an authorization system, GUMS or edg-mkgridmap, and configure it accordingly. 

Filtering and transforming grid jobs (i.e., setting site-specific attributes or resource limits), requires configuration of your site&rsquo;s job routes. For examples of common job routes, consult the [[Documentation/Release3.JobRouterRecipes][JobRouter recipes]] page.

%NOTE% If you are running HTConDor as your batch system, you will have two HTCondor configurations side-by-side (one residing in =/etc/condor/= and the other in =/etc/condor-ce=) and will need to make sure to differentiate the two when editing any configuration.

---++ How Security Works

In the OSG, security depends on a PKI infrastructure involving Certificate Authorities (CAs) where CAs sign and issue certifcates to users and hosts. When these users and hosts wish to communicate with each other, the identities of each party is confirmed by cross-checking their certificates with the signing CA and establishing trust. 

Due to the OSG's distributed nature, a user's job may end up at any number of sites, potentially needing to re-authenticate at multiple points. Instead of sending the user's certificate with the job for this re-authentication, trust can be delegated to a proxy that is generated from the user certificate, which is then attached to the job and expires after some set time for added security.

In its default configuration, HTCondor CE uses GSI-based authentication and authorization (the same as Globus GRAM) to verify the certificate chain, which will work with existing GUMS servers or grid mapfiles. Additionally, it can be reconfigured to provide alternate authentication mechanisms such as Kerberos, SSL, shared secret, or even IP-based authentication. More information about authorization methods can be found [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.2/3_6Security.html#SECTION00463000000000000000][here]].

---++ Next steps

If you're transitioning from a GRAM CE to HTCondor CE, the process is the same as if you were setting up a completely new CE, whether you're installing it on a new machine or alongside your GRAM CE.
