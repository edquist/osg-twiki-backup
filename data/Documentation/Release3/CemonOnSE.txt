---+ 3.0 Introduction

This page describes the installation of the Open Science Grid (OSG) information provider system on a Storage Element only configuration.
This will allow your storage element to report to BDII (and possibly !ReSS) to accurately portray itself as a grid resource to FTS and other 
grid services that depend on BDII as an information provider.  This installation procedure is specifically guided towards an installation 
separate from computing resources.  If you have a computing cluster, you should consider following the 
[[Documentation/Release3/InstallComputeElement][Compute Element Installation]] instructions, which include a CEMon installation.

---+ 4.0 Requirements

---++ 4.1 Host and OS

   * OS is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 32 and 64 bit and variants (Scientific Linux 5 and CentOS). Currently most of our testing has been done on Scientific Linux 5.
   * Root access 

---++ 4.2 Users

CEMon runs in tomcat, which will install the =tomcat= user.

---++ 4.3 Certificates

For CEMon to run, you need to have a host or service certificate in =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=. These files need to be owned by the =tomcat= user. The simplest thing to do is to copy your host certificate.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /etc/grid-security/http
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R tomcat /etc/grid-security/http
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chmod 0400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
</pre>

Note that you want to copy, not move, the hostcerts - Globus still expects them in the original location.  

---++ 4.4 Networking

Tomcat will run on port 8080 by default.  However, it is common to also change this to a secure port 8443.

---+ 5.0 Installation Procedure

%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" headingoffset="2"}%
%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefCaCerts" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%


---+ 5.1 Pre-installation Java Steps

!CEMon uses tomcat5 to run.  This is usually provided by your OS.  
Depending on your operating system, you may run into java compatibility problems.
In the Fermi distribution of Scientific Linux, java 1.6 is incompatible with tomcat5
and gives InvalidJarIndexException due to java jar re-packaging problems.
To get around this, install gcj-compat first:

<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install java-1.4.2-gcj-compat-devel
yum install xml-commons-apis
</pre>

Note: if you already have a newer java jdk, you may need to remove it first.  
This part of the installation is very OS dependent, so your mileage may vary.

*Note:* Help us expand this section for other OS by trying this procedure on other systems.


---+ 5.2 Installing Storage Element

At this point, you should install your storage element, by following one of the instructions
on the [[Documentation/Release3.NavAdminStorage][Storage Overview]] page, such as
a standalone [[Documentation/Release3.InstallOSGBestmanSE][BeStMan server]].

---++ 5.3 Installing Information Providers

To install the information service provider and CEMon, perform the following command.
<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install osg-se-cemon
</pre>


---+ 6.0 Information systems 

OSG sites report information about their site to OSG. This is particularly important for WLCG sites, which need to be present in the BDII information service so the WLCG can run jobs on these sites. However, this is important for all OSG sites because the information is used for site discovery.

---++ 6.1 Generic Information Provider (GIP)

The Generic Information Provider (GIP) is a program that discovers information about your site. It only discovers the information: other software propagates that software to OSG.

Configuration of the GIP happens entirely via the =/etc/osg/config.d/*.ini= files. These are the same files that are used by =osg-configure=. 

You will need to modify =/etc/osg/config.d/30-gip.ini=.  In particular, you will want to delete all subcluster entries (if this is a SE, there is no sub-cluster).  Delete all compute element entries and enter appropriate information for SE entries.  Comments in the file should help you out, or you can refer to this page for more information:  [[Documentation.Release3.NavTechGIP][More information on configuring the GIP]].

Lastly, you will need to add information to =/etc/gip/gip.conf=.  By default, this is an empty file for expert-only options.  You will need to add the following to configure a SE-only mode:

<pre class="file">
[gip]
override = False
check_osg = False
osg_config = /etc/gip/config.ini

[vo]
user_vo_map = /var/lib/osg/osg-user-vo-map.txt
</pre>
For convenience, this is provided for you in =/etc/gip/gip.se_only.conf=, so you can copy that file into gip.conf if desired.

---++ 6.2 CEMon

CEMon runs the GIP, then pushes its data to OSG. CEMon runs inside of =tomcat=, which runs as the =tomcat= user.

For CEMon to run, you need to have a host or service certificate in =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=. These files need to be owned by the =tomcat= user. The simplest thing to do is to copy your host certificate (see requirements above).

Make sure =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= exists, even if it is empty: <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% touch /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</pre>

You will need to modify =/etc/osg/config.d/30-cemon.ini= to configure cemon.  In particular, you will need to choose whether to use production or ITB servers for reporting, as shown below for the ITB:
<pre class="file">
ress_servers = %(itb-ress-servers)s
bdii_servers = %(itb-bdii-servers)s
</pre>

%WARNING% There is a minor problem in the GIP installation. For now, run the following commands to ensure the GIP will work properly:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown tomcat /var/log/gip
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown tomcat /var/cache/gip
</pre>

---++ 6.3 Configure OSG

Once you have finished editting the files, you will need to run osg-configure:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% osg-configure -v -d
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% osg-configure -c
</pre>

---++ 6.4 User VO File

The =user-vo-map= file is a simple, space-separated format that contains 2 columns; the first is a unix username and the second is the VO which that username correspond to.  In order to create it you need to configure the gums client.

The primary configuration file for the gums-client utilities is located in =/etc/gums/gums-client.properties=.  The two properties that you must change are:

| Attribute | Needs Editing | Value |
| gums.location | Yes | This should be set to the admin URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.location=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin |
| gums.authz | Yes | This should be set to the authorization interface URL for your gums server, usually of the form gums.authz=https://GUMS_HOSTNAME:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort |

After the gums client is configured to generate the file run the following once by hand:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% gums-host-cron
</pre>

=user-vo-map= should be created in the following location:

<verbatim>/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map</verbatim>

To have cron regularly update this file start the following service:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service gums-client-cron start
</pre>
---+ 7.0 Services

---++ 7.1 Starting and Enabling Services

   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStart" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%
   1. Depending on your authorization mechanism, choose one of these:
      1. *GUMS:* If you use GUMS, you need to run a client that creates the =user-vo-map= file:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gums-client-cron start
</pre>
      1. *edg-mkgridmap:* If you use edg-mkgridmap to make a grid-mapfile: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service edg-mkgridmap start
</pre>
   1. Start Tomcat <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service tomcat5 start
</pre>

You should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on:<br/>
%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlEnable" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%
<pre class="rootscreen">
# GUMS
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig gums-client-cron on

# edg-mkgridmap
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig edg-mkgridmap on

# Tomcat: 
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig tomcat5 on
</pre>

---++ 7.2 Stopping and Disabling Services

Run following commands if you need to stop any services.

   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStop" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%
   1. Turn off Tomcat: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service tomcat5 stop 
</pre>
   1. Based on your authorization mechanism:
      1. *GUMS*: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service gums-client-cron stop
</pre>
      1. *edg-mkgridmap*: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/service edg-mkgridmap stop
</pre>
In addition, you can disable services by running the following commands.  However, you don't need to do this normally.

%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlDisable"}%

To disable the other services:

<pre class="rootscreen">
# Tomcat:
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig tomcat5 off

# GUMS
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig gums-client-cron off
# edg-mkgridmap
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig edg-mkgridmap off
</pre>

---+ 8.0 Troubleshooting

   * Check if information becomes available in ITB BDII ten minutes after you have started the service.
   * Check the output of CEMon server in =/var/log/tomcat5/catalina.out=
   * Try to run gip_info manually to see if it runs.
