---+ About this Document
This document explains how you can configure the authorization system on your CE/SE (!GUMS/Edg-mkgridmap/simple grid-mapfile) to accept !RSV probe jobs.

---+ Resources that use GUMS

*Important Notes common to two GUMS-related sub-sections below:*
   * Each service cert DN needs to be added separately: You must manually add each !RSV service DN to the "rsv" user group (defined in step 1 below):
      * Go to the !GUMS server web interface at https://<YOUR-GUMS-HOST-NAME>:8443/gums/ and click "Manual User Group Members"
      * Then click "Add", then enter the service cert DN and =rsv= as the usergroup
      * Click "Save". And repeat for each DN (if you're configuring multiple !RSV service cert DNs).

   * <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: </strong> If your GUMS server version is < 1.2.17, then when converting to the the 1.2 format, it will give the rsv usergroup "write" privilege by default, so the administrator should change this to "read all".  This has been changed to "read all" by default in GUMS 1.2.17 and above.


---++ Add !RSV service cert DN using !GUMS server web interface
If you want to use the web interface, as recommended, add the same elements above using the web interface at https://<YOUR-GUMS-HOST-NAME>:8443/gums/ by:
   1 Click "User Groups" -> Click "Add" -> Select "manual" for the type, type =rsv= for the name, and select "read all" for the permissions -> Click "Save"
   2 Click "Account Mappers" -> Click "Add" -> Select "group" for the type, type =rsv= for the account and =rsv= for the name -> Cick "Save"
   3 Click "Group To Account Mappings" -> Click "Add" -> Select =rsv= for the the User Group and =rsv= for the Account Mapper -> Click "Save"
   4 Click "Host To Group Mappings" -> Click "edit" on all relevant host to group mappings -> Select =rsv= in the last "Group To Account Mapping(s)" slot -> Click "Save"
   5 Add the service cert DN to the user group, as described in the common notes above
---++ Add !RSV service cert DN manually by editing !GUMS server config file
We really recommend to use the Web GUI to avoid errors. A misplaced parenthesis may break all the configuration and be difficult to catch. Anyway, if you really want to add manually the configuration to allow an !RSV service certificate into your GUMS server config (a file in !GUMS 1.2 format), then take the following 4 steps:

   1. Add the following to the userGroups section in =/etc/gums/gums.config= on your !GUMS server:<pre class="file">
    &lt;manualUserGroup
        name='rsv'
        access='read all'
        description=''
        persistenceFactory='mysql'/&gt;
</pre> <br> Explanation (optional read): This creates a new gums group to hold all DNs that want to run RSV jobs. You will populate this group with the RSV DN as per instructions below.
   2. Add the following to the accountMappers section: <pre class="file">
    &lt;groupAccountMapper
        name='rsv'
        description=''
         accountName='rsv'/&gt;
</pre> <br> Explanation (optional read): This creates a new gums account mapper: whenever GUMS associates a DN to this mapper, the mapper will map that DN to the local user 'rsv'. GUMS is told by the association between the RSV group (defined in (1) ) and this mapper in the next step.
   3. Add the following to the groupToAccountMappings section: <pre class="file">
    &lt;groupToAccountMapping
            name='rsv'
            description=''
            accountingVoSubgroup=''
            accountingVo=''
            userGroups='rsv'
            accountMappers='rsv'/&gt;
</pre> <br> Explanation (optional read): This tells GUMS that the group created is (1) should be associated with the account mapper created in (2). In other words, if a DN is a member of the RSV user group, it should be mapped as per the RSV account mapper i.e. to the local account rsv.
   4. Add the rsv reference to your hostToGroupMapping element(s) such as ('bnl.gov' in the cn attribute should be replaced by your domain name): <pre class="file">
    &lt;hostToGroupMapping
        groupToAccountMappings='rsv, cdf, fermilab, grase, mis, fmri, sdss, star'
        description=''
        cn='*/?*.bnl.gov'/&gt;
</pre> <br>  Explanation (optional read): With this, GUMS will use the listed account mappings in the order they appear (see 'groupToAccountMappings'  attribute) for all requests generated by a CE in your domain name (see 'cn' attribute). 

Explanation (optional read):  In summary, when running an RSV probe, a CE presents the RSV DN to GUMS. GUMS checks that the CE is in your domain (as per step 4) and starts trying to match the RSV DN with the rules expressed in the listed group to account mappings. GUMS tries the rsv group to account mapping in its first attempt. As per step 3, GUMS checks if the RSV DN is part of the rsv user group (as per step 1). If the DN is there (...you will populate this group following instructions below...), GUMS selects the rsv account mapper (again, as per the association in step 3), which will map that DN to the rsv account (as per step 2).



---+ Resources that use a (manually edited) !GridMapfile
If you manually edit a grid-mapfile, then simply add something like this: 
 <pre class="file">"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=rsv/foo.bar.edu" rsv</pre>
The grid-mapfile is typically located at /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile.


---+ Resources that use !edg-mkgridmap

If you use edg-mkgridmap, then you should add to your file with local accounts mappings (e.g. =/etc/grid-security/local-grid-mapfile=) a line like the following:
 <pre class="file">"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=rsv/foo.bar.edu" rsv</pre> and make sure that the local file is enabled in =/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf=:
<pre class="file">gmf_local /etc/grid-security/local-grid-mapfile</pre>

%WARNING% make sure that the file name in the =gmf_local= line of =/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf= matches the name of the file you edited (=/etc/grid-security/local-grid-mapfile=)!

For more information on =edg-mkgridmap= and the use of local accounts you can check [[Edg-mkgridmap][the local authentication page describing edg-mkgridmap]].
