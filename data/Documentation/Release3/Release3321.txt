         * Fixed some leaky file descriptors

            * The MS_NODEV mount option is important as it intercepts a malicious user's ability to create and manipulate raw device files within containers they own. As a result, this update should be implemented with high urgency.
         * Cleaned up *printf() usage
         * Catch if user's group is not properly defined


These [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.3.20%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC%2C%20key%20DESC][JIRA tickets]] were addressed in this release.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues
   * The Koji client config has changed in the new version of Koji: `pkgurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/packages` has been replaced by `topurl=http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu` and the Koji client will give a harmless but annoying warning when it finds `pkgurl`. To get rid of the warning, update to osg-build >= 1.8.0, rerun `osg-koji setup`, and say 'yes' when asked to replace the Koji configuration file; or, you may make the above change manually.
   * A previous version (=1.17.0-2.5=) of the Gratia probes required changes in the HTCondor configuration to operate properly. Now, these changes need to be reverted to use verison =1.17.0-2.6= and later of the probes. The lines below are likely to be found in =condor_config.local= or a new file in =/etc/condor/config.d= directory. Delete these lines and run =condor_reconfig=.
<pre class="file">
# GlideinWMS Gratia commands
PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /var/lib/gratia/data
JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName="$$([IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), IfThenElse(IsUndefined(TARGET.FileSystemDomain), \"Local Job\", TARGET.FileSystemDomain), TARGET.GLIDEIN_Site), TARGET.GLIDEIN_ResourceName)])"
SUBMIT_EXPRS = $(SUBMIT_EXPRS) JOBGLIDEIN_ResourceName   
</pre>
   * On EL7, your version of voms-proxy-init may come from the voms-clients-java package; this version will continue to make legacy proxies by default. If you want the new behavior, install the voms-clients-cpp package and uninstall the voms-clients-java package.

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
