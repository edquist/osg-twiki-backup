---+!! Worker Node Client Install using OASIS
%TOC%


---# Introduction
This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of installing the worker node software and configuring the installed worker node software. Contents of the WN Client can be found [[InstallWNClient#4_Contents_of_the_worker_node][here]] 

---# About This Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for system administrators that are installing the worker node software on compute nodes. It covers the installation of the OSG Client Tools Package through OASIS. If you are already mounting [[InstallCvmfs][CVMFS]] on your Worker Nodes, you can leverage OASIS to avoid installing the OSG WN Client through RPM or tarball.

---# Requirements
Requirements for the OSG worker node installation:

---## Host and OS
   * OS is %SUPPORTED_OS%.

---# Installation and Configuration

---## Install the WN Client

   1. Follow the instructions [[NavTechOASIS][here]] to install OASIS.
   1. Source the setup file (==setup.sh== or ==setup.csh== depending on your shell). For EL5 platforms, run the following command: \
   <pre class='screen'>source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el5-x86_64/setup.sh</pre> \
   For EL6 platforms, run the following command
   <pre class='screen'>source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el6-x86_64/setup.sh</pre>

---## Configure the WN Client

Configure the value of OSG_GRID (see [[EnvironmentVariables]] and the [[IniConfigurationOptions#Storage][CE configuration instructions]]) on the CE. The value set for OSG_GRID must be the path returned by ==echo $OSG_LOCATION== once you source the setup file created by this installation.

---# Known Issues

Some possible issues that may come up:

   1. A missing softlink to the CA certs directory. To check this, run: \
   <pre class='screen'>ls -l /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el5-x86_64/etc/grid-security/</pre> \
   and check that 'certificates' is linked to somewhere. The fix is to yum update the oasis-config package to version 4. A known workaround is to run: \
   <pre class='screen'>export X509_CERT_DIR=/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/certificates</pre>\
   before any commands.
   1. !OpenJDK 7 must be installed from RPMs before using software that needs java (e.g. srm-ls) from OASIS.  There are some instructions [[Documentation.Release3.InstallSoftwareWithOpenJDK7][here]]. If you are running under an EL5 distribution, java programs may produce an error like this:\
   <pre class='screen'>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/globus/gsi/OpenSSLKey</pre>
   This shouldn't happen under EL6 distributions. The (unofficial) workaround is to run the following as root:\
   <pre class='screen'>mkdir /usr/share/java-1.7.0</pre>\
   <pre class='screen'>mkdir /usr/lib/java-1.7.0</pre>\
   This problem is also mentioned [[SoftwareTeam.Java6MigrationDetails][here]].
