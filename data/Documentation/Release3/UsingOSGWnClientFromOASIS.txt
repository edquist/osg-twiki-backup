---+ Configuring a Site to Use the Worker Node Client Software From OASIS

%TOC%

---++ About This Guide

The _OSG Worker Node Client_ is a collection of software components that is expected to be added to every worker node that can run OSG jobs. It provides a common environment and a minimal set of common tools that all OSG jobs can expect to use. Contents of the Worker Node Client can be found [[InstallWNClient#4_Contents_of_the_worker_node][here]].

It is possible to install the Worker Node Client software in a variety of ways, depending on what works best for distributing and managing software at your site:

   * [[InstallWNClient][Install using RPMs and Yum]] - useful when managing your worker nodes with a tool (e.g., Puppet, Chef) that can automate RPM installs
   * [[InstallWNClientTarball][Install using a tarball]] - useful when installing onto a shared filesystem for distribution to worker nodes
   * Use the Worker Node Client software from OASIS (this guide) - useful when [[NavTechOASIS][OASIS]] is already mounted on your worker nodes

This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of configuring a site to make the Worker Node Client software available from OASIS.

---++ Before Starting

Before starting the installation process, note that all worker nodes must be built on a supported operating system, currently %SUPPORTED_OS%.

Also note that, once configured to use OASIS, each use of Worker Node Client software will cause that software and its associated files to be downloaded from a CVMFS server or your local cache thereof. This may result in extra network activity, especially if Worker Node Client tools are used heavily.

---++ Configuring Your Site to Use the Worker Node Client From OASIS

Below are the one-time steps that you must perform to configure your site to use the Worker Node Client software from OASIS.

<ol>
  <li><p>On every worker node, [[InstallCvmfs][install and configure OASIS]]</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the OASIS path to the Worker Node Client software for your worker nodes:</p>
%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Worker Node OS* | *Use&hellip;* |
| EL&nbsp;5 | =/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el5-x86_64= |
| EL&nbsp;6 | =/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el6-x86_64= |
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the CE, in the =/etc/osg/config.d/10-storage.ini= file, set the =grid_dir= configuration setting to the path from the previous step</p>
    <p>For more information, see the [[EnvironmentVariables][OSG environment variables reference page]] and the [[IniConfigurationOptions#Storage][CE configuration instructions]].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you finish making changes to configuration files on your CE, validate, fix, and apply the configuration:</p>
    <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% osg-configure -v
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% osg-configure -c</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

---++ Manually Using the Worker Node Client From OASIS

If you must log onto a worker node and use the Worker Node Client software directly during your login session, use the steps below to set up access to the software:

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the OASIS path to the Worker Node Client software for your worker nodes:</p>
%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Worker Node OS* | *Use&hellip;* |
| EL&nbsp;5 | =/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el5-x86_64/setup.sh= |
| EL&nbsp;6 | =/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el6-x86_64/setup.sh= |
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up access to the Worker Node Client software for the duration of your login session:</p>
    <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% source <em>PATH</em></pre>
    <p>where <code><em>PATH</em></code> is from the previous step.
  </li>
</ol>


---+ Troubleshooting

Some possible issues that may come up:

   * A missing softlink to the CA certs directory. To check this, run:\
      <pre class="screen'>ls -l /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/3.2/current/el5-x86_64/etc/grid-security/</pre>\
      <p>and check that =certificates= is linked to somewhere. The fix is to yum update the oasis-config package to version 4. A known workaround is to run:</p>\
      <pre class="screen">export X509_CERT_DIR=/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/certificates</pre>\
      <p>before any commands.</p>
   * !OpenJDK 7 must be installed from RPMs before using software that needs Java (e.g., =srm-ls=) from OASIS. There are some instructions [[Documentation.Release3.InstallSoftwareWithOpenJDK7][here]]. If you are running under an EL5 distribution, java programs may produce an error like this:\
   <pre class='screen'>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/globus/gsi/OpenSSLKey</pre>
   This shouldn't happen under EL6 distributions. The (unofficial) workaround is to run the following as root:\
   <pre class='screen'>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /usr/share/java-1.7.0
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /usr/lib/java-1.7.0</pre>\
   This problem is also mentioned [[SoftwareTeam.Java6MigrationDetails][here]].
