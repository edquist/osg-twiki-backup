---+!! Using the OSG Worker Node Client From OASIS

If [[NavTechOASIS][OASIS]] is mounted then the [[UsingWorkerNodeClient][OSG Worker Node Client]] software
is available to use from there without installing the client rpms. The command to set it up is

    &nbsp;&nbsp; =source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/3.1/current/el5-x86_64/setup.sh=

or with 'el6' in place of 'el5' for RHEL6-derived platforms.

---+ Possible Pitfalls

Some possible issues that may come up:

   1. A missing softlink to the CA certs directory.
  To check this, run%BR%
  &nbsp;&nbsp; =ls -l /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/3.1/current/el5-x86_64/etc/grid-security/= %BR%
  and check that 'certificates' is linked to
  somewhere. The fix is to yum update the
  oasis-config package to version 4. A workaround (not
  much tested) is to run%BR%
  &nbsp;&nbsp; =export X509_CERT_DIR=/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/certificates= %BR%
  before any commands.%BR%
   1. !OpenJDK 7 must be installed from rpms before using software
  that needs java (e.g. srm-ls) from OASIS.  There are some
  instructions [[Documentation.Release3.InstallSoftwareWithOpenJDK7][here]].%BR%
  %BR%
  If you are running under an EL5 distribution,
  java programs may produce an error like this:%BR%
    &nbsp;&nbsp; =Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/globus/gsi/OpenSSLKey= %BR%
  This shouldn't happen under EL6 distributions.%BR%
  The (unofficial) workaround is to as root run%BR%
    &nbsp;&nbsp; =mkdir /usr/share/java-1.7.0= %BR%
    &nbsp;&nbsp; =mkdir /usr/lib/java-1.7.0= %BR%
  This problem is also mentioned [[SoftwareTeam.Java6MigrationDetails][here]].%BR%
