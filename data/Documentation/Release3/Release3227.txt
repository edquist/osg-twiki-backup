Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues

   * =empty-ca-certs= package may need manual updating
      * If you see the following error when updating to 3.2.27: \
        <pre>Error: empty-ca-certs conflicts with osg-ca-certs-1.48-1.osg32.el6.noarch</pre> \
        You will need to update the =empty-ca-certs= package. \
        The =empty-ca-certs= package is kept in a separate repository named =osg-empty= instead of the main OSG repositories. \
        In order to update the package, you will need to temporarily enable the =osg-empty= repository. \
        Use the following command to update your site: \
        <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update --enablerepo=osg-empty</pre> \
        or use this to update just =empty-ca-certs=: \
        <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update --enablerepo=osg-empty empty-ca-certs</pre>


---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
