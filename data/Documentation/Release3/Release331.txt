   * Enterprise Linux 7: Worker node support only
   * GUMS 1.5.0
      * A security-related bug was found in the GUMS administrative interface. The risk of this vulnerability has been assessed by OSG Security Team as “Critical”. A new GUMS version 1.5.0 has been released and it is included in OSG Software version 3.2.27/3.3.1. Site administrators should update ASAP.
   * [[https://www-auth.cs.wisc.edu/lists/htcondor-users/2015-August/msg00153.shtml][HTCondor 8.3.8]]
   * HTCondor CE 1.15
      * Add 'default_remote_cerequirements' attribute to the JOB_ROUTER_DEFAULTS
      * Verify the first route in JOB_ROUTER_ENTRIES in the init script
      * htcondor-ce-collecotr now uses /etc/sysconfig/condor-ce-collector for additional configuration 
   * gridFTP-HDFS checksum verification improvements
      * Checksum algorithm names are checked with a case insensitive comparison
      * Error codes are properly returned to the user
   * CA certificates based on [[https://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/CHANGES][IGTF 1.67]]
   * !StashCache improvements
      * Added logging to the !StashCache daemon
      * Advertise the !StashCache daemon version to the master !ClassAd
      * Improved example configuration files to include "pss.trace all"


These [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20SOFTWARE%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%203.3.1%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC][JIRA tickets]] were addressed in this release.

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues

   * Running osg-configure with the new version of HTCondor installed causes a deprecation warning to be emitted. The warning does not affect the services.
   * !StashCache packages need to be manually configured
      * Manual configuration for origin server
         * Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: \
<pre class="file">
xrd.port 1094
all.role server
all.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213
all.export / nostage
xrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect
ofs.trace none
xrd.trace conn
cms.trace all
sec.protocol  host
sec.protbind  * none
all.adminpath /var/run/xrootd
all.pidpath /var/run/xrootd
</pre>
      * Manual configuration for cache server
         * In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare =pss.origin <stash-redirector.example.com>= instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for !StashCache is [[https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/pages/viewpage.action?title=Installing+an+XRootD+server+for+Stash+Cache&spaceKey=STAS][here]].
      * In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from: \
<pre class="file">
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo"
</pre> \
to \
<pre class="file">
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo" 
</pre>

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
