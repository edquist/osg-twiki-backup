---++ Install Instructions
%INCLUDE{"InstallVDTRepo" headingoffset="1"}%
   1. Install the WN-Client <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-testing --nogpgcheck install osg-wn-client </pre>


---++ Configuring the CE for the RPM
=$OSG_GRID= will have to change.  Most jobs source =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= before performing any work.  For backwards capability, we have created =/etc/osg/wn-client/setup.sh= to mimic this functionality.  Setting =$OSG_GRID= (in the CE config.ini) to =/etc/osg/wn-client= should provide backward capability.

On an mixed RPM/pacman based system, a possible solution would be to symlink the existing =$OSG_GRID= location to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.

---++ Where to report problems
If you have issues, email osg-software@opensciencegrid.org.
