---+!! Worker Node Client RPM Install
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC%

---+ Introduction
This document is intended to guide system administrators through the process of installing the worker node software and configuring the installed worker node software.

---+ About This Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for system administrators that are installing the worker node software on compute nodes.  It covers installation and configuration of the worker node software using the RPMs distributed by OSG.

---+ Requirements
A RHEL5 (or !CentOS 5, SL5) machine with [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL][EPEL]] repos enabled.

---+ Install Instructions
%INCLUDE{"YumRepositories" section="OSGRepoBrief" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

Some of the worker node client software verifies proxies or certificates.  In order to do this, they will need the CA certificates used to sign the proxies.  
%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefCaCerts" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---++ Install the Worker Node Client
   1. Install the WN-Client <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install osg-wn-client </pre>

%INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="FetchCRLConfig" TOC_SHIFT="+"}%

---+ Configuring the CE for wn-client RPMs
Using the wn-client software installed from RPMs will require a few changes on the compute element so that the resource's configuration can be correctly reported.  The =$OSG_GRID= variable, which points to the location of the wn-client installation directory, will need to change.  Most jobs source =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= before performing any work.  For backwards capability, we have created =/etc/osg/wn-client/setup.sh= to mimic this functionality.  Setting =$OSG_GRID= (in the CE config.ini) to =/etc/osg/wn-client= should provide backward capability.

On an mixed RPM/pacman based system, a possible solution would be to symlink the existing =$OSG_GRID= location to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.

---+ Using the RPM-based worker nodes with a Pacman-based CE

[[Documentation.Release3.KnownProblems#SetWNPath][See our notes in the "Known Problems"]] if you are using a Pacman-based CE with your RPM-based worker nodes.


---+ Other considerations
Please see the documentation on using [[Documentation/Release3.YumRpmBasics][yum and RPM]], [[Documentation/Release3.InstallBestPractices][the best practices]] for using yum to install software, and using [[Documentation/Release3.YumRepositories][yum repositories]].
