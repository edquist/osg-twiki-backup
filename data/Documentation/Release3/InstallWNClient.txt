---+!! Worker Node Client RPM Install
%TOC%

%INCLUDE{"InstallVDTRepo" headingoffset="1"}%
%INCLUDE{"InstallCACerts" headingoffset="1"}%
   1. Install the WN-Client <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-testing install osg-wn-client </pre>

---+++ Configuring fetch-crl on the Worker Node
fetch-crl is now installed as a service.  There are two services available.  fetch-crl-boot runs only at boot time.  The fetch-crl-cron "service" runs fetch-crl every 6 hours (with a random sleep time included) by default.  Both services are disabled by default.  
---++++ Enable and Start fetch-crl:
To enable fetch-crl by default on the node:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig fetch-crl-boot on
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on
</pre>
To start fetch-crl:
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service fetch-crl-boot start
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service fetch-crl-cron start
</pre>
---++++ Configure Proxy Server
To configure fetch-crl to use a proxy server, create  =/etc/sysconfig/fetch-crl= and add =export http_proxy=http://your.squid.fqdn= to the file.
---++++ Modify fetch-crl-cron run times
To modify the times that fetch-crl-cron runs, edit =/etc/cron.d/fetch-crl=.  Cron job files are marked as a config/noreplace files in the rpm.  Any updates to those files will be preserved during an rpm update.
---++ Configuring the CE for the RPM
=$OSG_GRID= will have to change.  Most jobs source =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= before performing any work.  For backwards capability, we have created =/etc/osg/wn-client/setup.sh= to mimic this functionality.  Setting =$OSG_GRID= (in the CE config.ini) to =/etc/osg/wn-client= should provide backward capability.

On an mixed RPM/pacman based system, a possible solution would be to symlink the existing =$OSG_GRID= location to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.
