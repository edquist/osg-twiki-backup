%TOC%

---++ About this Document

dCache is a storage solution and its gratia probes provide accounting for transfers and storage: The dCache-transfer probe reports the details of each file transfer into or out of a dCache file server while the dCache-storage probe is responsible for reporting storage capacity and storage usage.

This document describes how you can install and configure the Gratia Storage and Transfer probes for dCache based Storage Elements.

---++ Requirements

%INCLUDE{"Documentation/Release3.DocumentationSnippets" section="OsgPreReqs"}%

---++ Installing the dCache Gratia Probes

To install the gratia probe, run the following command on the dCache admin node:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum install gratia-probe-dcache-transfer
</pre>

%NOTE% If you need to install it on another node, make sure to configure the postgres database running on dCache admin node to allow remote access from node on which probe is installed.

---++ Configuring the dCache Gratia Probes

To configure dCache transfer probe you will need to modify the configuration file ==/etc/gratia/dCache-transfer/ProbeConfig== as follows
<pre class="file">
    CollectorHost="gratia-osg-%RED%itb%ENDCOLOR%.opensciencegrid.org:80"
    SSLHost="gratia-osg-%RED%itb%ENDCOLOR%.opensciencegrid.org:443"
    SSLRegistrationHost="gratia-osg-%RED%itb%ENDCOLOR%.opensciencegrid.org:80"
    UserVOMapFile="%RED%/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map%ENDCOLOR%"
    SiteName="%RED%YOUR SITE NAME%ENDCOLOR%"
    Grid="OSG-%RED%ITB%ENDCOLOR%"
    EnableProbe="%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%"
     DBHostName="%RED%ADMIN NODE%ENDCOLOR%"
</pre>
%ICON{note}% If you are installing on dCache admin node you don't need to change !DBHostName (localhost is a default)

To configure dCache storage probe you will need to modify the configuration file ==/etc/gratia/dCache-storage/ProbeConfig== as follows
<pre class="file">
    CollectorHost="gratia-osg-%RED%itb%ENDCOLOR%.opensciencegrid.org:80"
    SSLHost="gratia-osg-%RED%itb%ENDCOLOR%.opensciencegrid.org:443"
    SSLRegistrationHost="gratia-osg-%RED%itb%ENDCOLOR%.opensciencegrid.org:80"
    UserVOMapFile="%RED%/var/lib/osg/user-vo-map%ENDCOLOR%"
    SiteName="%RED%YOUR SITE NAME%ENDCOLOR%"
    Grid="OSG-%RED%ITB%ENDCOLOR%"
    EnableProbe="%RED%1%ENDCOLOR%"
    InfoProviderUrl="http://%RED%ADMIN NODE%ENDCOLOR%:2288/info"
</pre>
%ICON{warning}% In above configuration, please use ITB for testing

You will also need to configure ==/etc/gums/gums-client.properties== in order to accurately collect grid resource usage and metrics by VO for transfer submitted using grid proxies or where voms proxy information is not available.<pre class="file">
gums.location=https://%RED%GUMS_HOST%ENDCOLOR%:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin
gums.authz=https://%RED%GUMS_HOST%ENDCOLOR%:8443/gums/services/GUMSXACMLAuthorizationServicePort
</pre>
%ICON{warning}% if you are not using a default port (8443) you have to change it as well.

---++ Using the dCache Gratia Probes

=gratia-probes-cron= is the service that manages gratia probes on a host. As a reminder, here are common service commands (all run as =root=):

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *To &hellip;* | *On EL&nbsp;6, run the command&hellip;* | *On EL&nbsp;7, run the command&hellip;* |
| Start a service | =service keepalived start= | =systemctl start keepalived= |
| Stop a service | =service keepalived stop= | =systemctl start keepalived= |
| Enable a service to start during boot | =chkconfig keepalived on= | =systemctl enable keepalived= |
| Disable a service from starting during boot | =chkconfig keepalived off= | =systemctl disable keepalived= |

---++ Validating the dCache Gratia Probe

   1. First, ensure that Gratia transfer probe for dCache is running: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%  ps auxww|grep gratia-dcache-transfer
root      2680  2.3  0.2 174584 11080 ?        S    14:32   0:19 /usr/bin/python /usr/share/gratia/dCache-transfer/gratia-dcache-transfer
</pre>
   1. Check the log files, located under =/var/log/gratia=
