---++ Storage Elements

A storage element is an interface for grid jobs and grid personnel to access underlying storage through the Storage Resource Management protocol (SRM), the Globus Grid FTP protocol, and possibly other interfaces as well.

To create a storage element, you will need:
* An SRM interface (such as !BeStMan 2)
* A !GridFTP server (Globus !GridFTP Server)
* An underlying storage system (Hadoop, !XrootD, Dcache, Lustre, etc)
