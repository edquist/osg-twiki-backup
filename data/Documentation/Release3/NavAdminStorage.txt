---+ About this Document

This document is an overview of all twiki document pages related to storage elements.
Included, you will find links to pages to explain the various storage technologies and plan your development.
There are installation documents for 

---++ Storage Elements

A storage element is an interface for grid jobs and grid personnel to access underlying storage through the Storage Resource Management protocol (SRM), the Globus Grid FTP protocol, and possibly other interfaces as well.

To create a storage element, you will need:
   * An SRM interface (such as !BeStMan 2)
   * A !GridFTP server (Globus !GridFTP Server)
   * An underlying storage system (Hadoop, !XrootD, Dcache, Lustre, etc)

---+++ Planning and Reference Information

   * [[Documentation.StorageGridFTP][GridFTP Overview]]: Information about !GridFTP
   * Documentation.BestmanStorageElement
   * Documentation.InformationServicesStorage
