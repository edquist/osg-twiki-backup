---+ OSG Software release 3.1.8

*Release Date*: 2011-08-14

---++ Summary of changes

The highlights of this release include:
   * Condor 7.8.2 is a recommended security update. 
   * A new version of the Gratia probe that fixes various bugs
   * A new version of osg-cleanup that fixes a bug that prevented it from cleaning up all appropriate files. 
   * A new version of lcmaps that makes it work better with Condor. Please note that you will get an updated lcmaps configuration file that you need to merge with your existing configuration. (=/etc/lcmaps.db=)

Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in [[Documentation.Release3][the "Release3"]] area of the Twiki. 

---++ Updating to the new release

If you have an existing installation, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or regex]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, rpm does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
