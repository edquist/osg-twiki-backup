---++ Known Issues

   * !StashCache packages need to be manually configured
      * Manual configuration for origin server
         * Assuming that the origin server connects only to a redirector (not directly to cache server), minimal xrootd configuration is required. The configuration file, /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.cfg, in this release is overkill. Here are recommended settings to use: \
<pre class="file">
xrd.port 1094
all.role server
all.manager stash-redirector.example.com 1213
all.export / nostage
xrootd.trace emsg login stall redirect
ofs.trace none
xrd.trace conn
cms.trace all
sec.protocol  host
sec.protbind  * none
all.adminpath /var/run/xrootd
all.pidpath /var/run/xrootd
</pre>
      * Manual configuration for cache server
         * In contrast to the origin server configuration, one needs to declare =pss.origin <stash-redirector.example.com>= instead of configuring the cmsd or manager (only the xrootd daemon is required on the cache server). More detailed configuration of cache server for !StashCache is [[https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/pages/viewpage.action?title=Installing+an+XRootD+server+for+Stash+Cache&spaceKey=STAS][here]].
      * In both cases, administrator needs to set the path of custom configuration file for its xrootd/cmds instance in /etc/sysconfig/xrootd, For example, change the cmds default from: \
<pre class="file">
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-clustered.cfg -k fifo"
</pre> \
to \
<pre class="file">
CMSD_DEFAULT_OPTIONS="-l /var/log/xrootd/cmsd.log -c /etc/xrootd/xrootd-stashcache-origin-server.marian -k fifo" 
</pre>

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

To update to this series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the current OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>

%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
