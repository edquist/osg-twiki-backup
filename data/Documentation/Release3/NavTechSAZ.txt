%TOC%

---+ Introduction

SAZ empowers a grid administrator to enforce a whitelist/blacklist capability for grid jobs running at his/her site. It does so by providing site admin the capability to ban (disable) or enable 4 individual entities
   * =User= - A user can be banned/disabled from running grid jobs based on his/her DN (Distinguished Name) or proxy remaining lifetime. This is useful if you want to ban a user gone rogue or user whose certificate has been compromised or/and enforce a limit on proxy lifetime on your grid resource.
   * =CA= (Certificate Authority) based on its DN. This would ban a CA and thus all users using grid certificates issued by that CA from running grid jobs on your site.
   * =VO= (Virtual Organization) based on its name. This would ban a VO and thus all users belonging to that VO from running grid jobs on your site.
   * =FQAN= (Fully Qualified Attribute Name) based on its name. This would disable any jobs coming in with voms credentials generated using this FQAN from running on your site.

In addition, it also enables an administrator to "trust" a user - which means user is allowed to run grid jobs on the site in question using vanilla grid proxy (i.e. without a FQAN)

---+ Why do I need SAZ ?
Well, as a site admin for multiple/single grid site, if you have wished for a centralized service to 

   * ban/unban users/CAs/VOs/Roles across all your sites 
   * control maximum allowed lifetime for incoming user proxies

then, SAZ is exactly what you need.

---+ Is it an alternate to GUMS?

No, SAZ is not an alternate to GUMS. SAZ is solely a banning tool that lets you ban various entities. GUMS (though provides limited banning capability) primary purpose is to map incoming grid credentials to local user accounts.
The grid authentication/authorization infrastructure setup at [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][FermiGrid]] has been successfully using both GUMS and SAZ for several years.

---+ How Scalable is it?

SAZ has been extensively stress tested by [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][FermiGrid]] against both legacy and XACML protocols. Details on stress tests can be looked up [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/internal/GUMSSAZStressTestsRound2.pdf][here]]
