---++Condor Hold Code 3

---+++Known causes:

Hold Code 3 indicates that periodic-hold (in in the Condor submit file) evaluated to true.

---+++Recommendations:

If the job has a periodic release expression than it should continue execution when periodic-release is true.

Otherwise, you can release it manually using condor_release.
