---++Setting high and low ports for Condor

If a client is firewalled it may be necessary to specify a port range for Condor's use.

---+++Recommendations
In the file $VDT_LOCATION/condor/etc/condor_config set the following values:

=HIGHPORT = &lt;high port&gt;=

=LOWPORT = &lt;low port&gt;=

Remember to check the client's firewall as well to be certain the specified range is compatible.

You will want to check the Globus port range as well:
