Detailed changes are below. All of the documentation can be found in the [[Documentation.Release3][Release3]] area of the !TWiki.

---++ Known Issues

If you are updating to !XRootD 4.1 on an EL 5 system (Scientific Linux 5, Red Hat EL 5, or !CentOS 5), you will need to take extra steps to perform the update cleanly.

   1. Determine whether you have any !XRootD plugins installed: <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% rpm -qa | grep -i xrootd</pre> \
   <p>If you see packages named =xrootd-hdfs=, =xrootd-lcmaps=, =xrootd-status-probe=, =xrootd-dsi=, or =xrootd-cmstfc= continue following the update steps below. Otherwise, there are no special update instructions and you can proceed as usual!</p>
   1. Remove any 32-bit !XRootD plugin RPMs installed on your x86-64 system: <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum remove xrootd*.i386</pre>
   1. Update all !XRootD-related packages in a single command (excluding non-XRootD packages for now):<pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update xrootd*</pre>

%NOTE% Avoid trying to update each !XRootD-related package one at a time. That process will most likely fail.

---++ Updating to the new release

---+++ Update Repositories

This is a release in a newer [[Documentation.Release3.OSGReleaseSeries][OSG Release Series]].
To update to this new series, you need [[Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories#Install_OSG_Repositories][install the new OSG repositories]].

---+++ Update Software

Once the new repositories are installed, you can update to this new release with:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum update
</pre>


%NOTE% Please be aware that running =yum update= may also update other RPMs. You can exclude packages from being updated using the =--exclude&#61;[package-name or glob]= option for the =yum= command.

%NOTE% Watch the yum update carefully for any messages about a =.rpmnew= file being created.  That means that a configuration file had been editted, and a new default version was to be installed.  In that case, RPM does not overwrite the editted configuration file but instead installs the new version with a =.rpmnew= extension. You will need to merge any edits that have made into the =.rpmnew= file and then move the merged version into place (that is, without the =.rpmnew= extension).  Watch especially for =/etc/lcmaps.db=, which every site is expected to edit.
