   $ Mass Storage System<a name="DefsMassStorageSystem"></a>:  high-capacity, large-scale data archive (usually tape) that is more intelligent than a normal storage system, and used to hold large amounts of infrequently accessed data. See also [[#HRM][HRM]], [[#TRM][TRM]].
   $ Matchmaking<a name="DefsMatchmaking"></a>: The process of matching a job to a slot while maintaining site priorities.
   $ MDS<a name="DefsMds"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsMetacomputingDirectoryService][Metacomputing Directory Service]].
   $ media changer (MC)<a name="DefsMediaChanger"></a>: Physcial device that mounts and dismounts the media into and out of drives according to requests from the Movers. 
   $ memory-mapped I/O: _Also_ mmapped I/O. With this type of I/O, part of the CPU&#8217;s address space is interpreted not as accesses to memory, but as accesses to a device; once you map a file to memory, changes made to the memory map are propagated back to the file. Mmapped I/O strives to avoid memory copies of the data between the application memory space and the kernel memory space (also see direct I/O and POSIX I/O). Mmapped I/O is in the POSIX standard. 
   $ message passing<a name="MessagePassing"></a>: An approach to parallel computing where data and work is divided "across the processors (striving for optimal load balancing)" and communication between them is managed "(striving for minimal and non-blocking communication) by explicitly calling specific library functions." The _de facto_ standard for message passing is [[#DefsMpi][MPI]]. [[#DEJ06][(DEJ06)]]
   $ Message Passing Interface (MPI)<a name="DefsMpi"></a>: 
   $ Metacomputing Directory Service (MDS)<a name="DefsMetacomputingDirectoryService"></a>: a GIIS from Globus that consists of a LDAP representation in which directory structures, data representations and APIs are defined.
   $ MIMD: _See_ [[#DefsMimd][Multiple Instruction, Multiple Domain]]
   $ mmapped I/O: _See_ memory-mapped I/O.
   $ monitor server (MS)<a name="DefsMonitorServer"></a>: Available for investigating network-related problems. It attempts to mimic the communication between an encp request, the corresponding library manager, and the mover. 
   $ mover (dCache)<a name="DefsMover"></a>: A process that receives or sends data to the client from the dCache system.
   $ MSS<a name="DefsMss"></a>: See [[#DefsMassStorageSystem][Mass Storage System]]. 
   $ Multi-Grid Interoperability Now (GIN)<a name="DefsMultiGridInteroperabilityNow"></a>: an initiative between 9 grid infrastructure projects.
   $ Multiple Domain, Multiple Instruction (MIMD)<a name="DefsMimd"></a>: An approach to parallel computing that combines function and domain decompositions. MIMD can be further subdivided into _Global Memory, Shared Variable_ (shared memory multiprocessors); _Global Memory, Message Passing (GMMP)_; _Distrbuted Memory, Shared Variable (DMSV)_ (distributed shared memory); and _Distributed Memory, Message Passing (DMMP)_. MPI is concentrated on DMMP.  _See also:_ [[#MessagePassing][message passing]] [[#DEJ06][(DEJ06)]] 
   $ Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD)<a name="DefsMisd"></a>: functional decomposition of a computing problem where each processor is assigned a different role/responsibility. [[#DEJ06]]
