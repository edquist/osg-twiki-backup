   $ gatekeeper: A gatekeeper is a process used at a site to take incoming job requests and check the security to make sure each is allowed to use the associated computing resource(s). The gatekeeper process starts up the job-manager process after successful authentication.  It is a [[#DefsGums][GUMS]] client, consisting of an admin tool for querying and changing the state of the GUMS server, charged with enforcing the site mapping established by GUMS. 

   $ Generic Information Provider (GIP)<a name="DefsGenericInformationProvider"></a>: a configurable LDAP information provider that differentiates between static and dynamic information. OSG sites use GIP to advertise a variety of grid-related configuration data.   GIP is interoperable with LCG.

   $ GFAL<a name="DefsGfal"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsGridFileAccessLayer][Grid File Access Layer]].

   $ GGF: The Global Grid Forum ( GGF ) is a community-initiated forum of thousands of individuals from industry and research leading the global standardization effort for grid computing. GGF's primary objectives are to promote and support the development, deployment, and implementation of Grid technologies and applications via the creation and documentation of "best practices" - technical specifications, user experiences, and implementation guidelines. (http://www.gridforum.org/ )

   $ GIP<a name="DefsGip"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsGenericInformationProvider][Generic Information Provider]] .

   $ GLUE schema<a name="DefsGlueSchema"></a>:  _See_ [[#DefsGridLaboratoryUniformEnvironment][Grid Laboratory Uniform Environment schema]].

   $ GOC<a name="DefsGoc"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsGridOperationsCenter][Grid Operations Center]].

   $ gPLAZMA<a name="DefsGplazma"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsGridAwarePluggableAuthorizationManagement][grid-aware PLuggable AuthoriZation MAnagement]].

   $ GRAM<a name="DefsGram"></a>: [[#DefsGridResourceAllocationAndManagement][Grid Resource Allocation and Management]].

   $ Grid File Access Layer (GFAL)<a name="DefsGridFileAccessLayer"></a>: An LCG-provided interface for the normal file I/O operations (Open/Seek/Read/Write/Close) which includes a limited set of POSIX functions for file management. The GFAL interface is designed to hide the grid storage interactions (replica catalog, SRM and file access mechanism) from user applications.

   $ Grid Laboratory Uniform Environment (GLUE) schema<a name="DefsGridLaboratoryUniformEnvironment"></a>: an abstract modeling for Grid resources and mapping to concrete schemas that can be used in Grid Information Services.  It aims to define, publish and enable the use of common schemas for interoperability between the EU and US physics grid project efforts. _See also_ [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Main/HomePage][GLUE Schema site (REF)]].

   $ Grid Monitor<a name="DefsGridMonitor"></a>: A part of condor-g that replaces the monitoring (polling) duties previously done by jobmanagers. 

   $ Grid Operations Center<a name="DefsGridOperationsCenter"></a>: The help and support center for the entire OSG. _See also_ [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/]].

   $ grid proxy<a name="DefsGridProxy"></a>: limited-life certificate signed by the user, or by another proxy, used for sending several jobs without having to reauthenticate with your password each time. Grid proxies provide a convenient alternative to constantly entering passwords, but are also less secure than the user's normal security credential.  

   $ Grid Resource Allocation and Management (GRAM or WS-GRAM)<a name="DefsGridResourceAllocationAndManagement"></a>: service that "provides a single interface for requesting and using remote system resources for the execution of 'jobs'. The most common use of GRAM is remote job submission and control. It is designed to provide a uniform, flexible interface to job scheduling systems." [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gram/ws/][REF]]

   $ Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI)<a name="DefsGridSecurityInfrastructure"></a>: A globus authorization and authentication schema that includes PKI, single sign-on, and a time-limited proxy certificate.

   $ Grid User Management System (GUMS)<a name="DefsGridUserManagementSystem"></a>: GUMS is a Grid Identity Mapping Service. It maps the credential for each incoming job at a site to an appropriate site credential, and communicates the mapping to the gatekeeper. GUMS is particularly well suited to a heterogeneous environment with multiple gatekeepers; it allows the implemenation of a single site-wide usage policy, thereby providing better control and security for access to the site's grid resources.  _See also_ [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/index.html][BNL's GUMS site]].

   $ grid-aware PLuggable AuthoriZation MAnagement (gPLAZMA)<a name="DefsGridAwarePluggableAuthorizationManagement"></a>: An architecture that utilizes VOMS extended X.509 certificate specification for defining extra attributes ([[#DefsFullyQualifiedAttributeName][FQANs]]), based on RFC 3281, and provides role-based access control (RBAC) to dCache.

   $ grid-mapfiles: a file-based Access Control List (ACL) mechanism that statically maps a certificate subject to a userID, authorizing them to access and use [[#DefsGsi][GSI]]-enabled services (i.e., OSG). It is a plain text file listing the subject name of the trusted certificate and the corresponding local user name. Each [[#DefsDistinguishedName][DN]]can be listed in the file only once; but several DNs can be mapped to a single user name.

   $ <nop>GridFTP<a name="DefsGridFtp"></a>: An extension to ftp protocol that includes strong authentication and encryption via Globus GSI; multiple, parallel data channels; third-party transfers; tunable network & I/O parameters; and server-side processing and command pipelining. Systems can be "gridFTP-enabled". _See Also_ [[#DefsGsiFtp][GSI ftp]]. 

   $ Gridmap callout interface<a name="DefsGridmapCalloutInterface"></a>: The Globus gatekeeper Gridmap callout interface allows for the replacement of the built-in Gridmap file mechanism with a component (called PRIMA) that can query the GUMS identity mapping service. The interface between PRIMA and the GUMS identity mapping service is based on the OGSA SAML Authorization Interface. 

   $ !GsiFTP<a name="DefsGsiFtp"></a>: An implementation of ftp that uses Grid Proxies for authentication and authorization and is compatible with popular tools such as globus-url-copy (from the globus toolkit).  Uses [[#DefsGridSecurityInfrastructure][GSI]] for authentication and authorization.

   $ GUMS<a name="DefsGums"></a>: _See_ [[#DefsGridUserManagementSystem][Grid User Management System]].

<!-- forrest

   $ GRIS<a name="DefsGris"></a>: An information provider protocol.
   $ GSDA<a name="DefsGsda"></a>: Grid Storage Domain Agent.
   $ GSI<a name="DefsGsi"></a>: [[#DefsGridSecurityInfrastructure][Grid Security Infrastructure]].
   $ gsiDCap<a name="DefsGsiDcap"></a>: An authenticated flavor of [[#DefsDcap][DCap]].
