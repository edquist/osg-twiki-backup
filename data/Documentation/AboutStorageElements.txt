---+ About Storage Elements
%EDITTHIS%

A Storage Element on OSG is a node/cluster of nodes which

   * Provides Storage Space.
   * Is accessible to applications running on OSG through either gridftp and/or srm interface. 
   * Has [[ReleaseDocumentation//GenericInformationProviders][GIP]] setup and configured properly which publishes its information.
   * Has well-defined policy for cleanup and usage.
   * Is registered with OSG.

Note that the Storage Element described above is not the same as the storage available on a Compute Element node, which is desribed in [[ReleaseDocumentation/LocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]]. The latter storage is part of a CE and is functional to it, not providing outside access to the storage space. To be able to access the space of a CE-Storage from outside a Computing Element, usually a Storage Element is used. Though they may access the same physical storage (disk or tape), the storage on a Compute Element and that available from a Storage Element are two distinct resources. They are described in different portions of the [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/][GLUE Schema]], the first one within the CE elements of the schema, the second one in the SE elements. The elements in the CE-SE binding allow to connect them together and specify which SE is accessing the same storage space (disk or tape) served by a CE-Storage.

---++ Types of Storage Elements

---+++ !!<nop>GridFTP-based File System 

 A [[http://www.globus.org/grid_software/data/gridftp.php][GridFTP]]-based SE is simply a file system directory accessible via GSI-authenticated ftp.
This provides no space management functions and limited permission management functions.
In LCG this is called also "Classic SE".

The parameters needed to publish a !GridFTP server in [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/][GLUE Schema]] are quite simple. The !GridFTP server information is contained in an <nop>SEAccessProtocol element of the schema. A !GridFTP server is defined by an end-point, which includes the host and port of the server and the base directory. Additionally, the protocol type (gsiftp) and version are defined. The whole directory tree under the base directory is part of the SE. There may be even overlapping SEs if one base directory is a subdirectory of another or if there links between the two trees. This could potentially provide more throughput by allowing more than one server to access the data, however, using SRM (see below) is preferable for providing this and many other features.

The easiest way to install a [[http://www.globus.org/grid_software/data/gridftp.php][GridFTP]] server with all the required certificates is to install it as part of a comput element, having chosen a base directory to to supply the storage space. There is no special requirement about the base directory: it has to be a valid path for the !GridFTP server and have the protections set to provide the desired access to Grid users. Sometimes setting sticky (only the creator of a file can remove it) or setgroup (group is maintained in subdirectories) IDs in the file system may be useful.


---+++ !!SRM/Gridftp-based File System

SRM stands for Storage Resource Manager. An [[http://www.globus.org/grid_software/data/gridftp.php][SRM/GridFTP]]-based SE is simply a directory accessible via GSI-authenticated ftp and [[http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/][SRM]] interfaces.
SRM allows to manage and query the resource, but accessing files directly is not allowed. It would provide a backdoor and thus violate the constraints imposed by SRM. Except for the SRM interface on top of it, this is like the previous [[#Gridftp_based_File_System][Gridftp based File System]].

---+++ !!SRM/dCache

  This is a full implementation of a Storage Element that enforces stronger constraints and can manage a space spanning more volumes. For information about the VDT-dCache release of SRM/dCache, see the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html][VDT-dCache webpage]]. Support for SRM/dCache installations using the VDT-dCache package is available through vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org.
For information on dCache, see the [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache documentation]].

---+++ !!SRM/Drm

  This is a full implementation of a Storage Element that enforces stronger constraints and can manage a space spanning more volumes.
[[http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist][Documentation and a manual for SRM/DRM v1.2.9 is available]]. Support is available through srm@lbl.gov.
