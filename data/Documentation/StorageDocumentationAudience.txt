(Initially, this is [[Main.ForrestChristian][Forrest Christian's]] guesswork.)
%STARTINCLUDE%
There are several audiences that will need to be addressed:
   $ *Developer*: Person creating an application or package which uses the storage elements available on the grid. 
   $ *Storage Activity Member*: Person who is part of the committees and working groups. (Should this be expanded to include non-OSG but related committees?)
   $ *Virtual Organization Managers*: These persons will need overviews of how storage works, what benefits they will get from participating, &#8230;. We assume that while technically proficient in their own field, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Managers do not have a deep understanding of storage technologies.
   $ *Storage Systems Administrators*: The administrator of a particular storage element at the site. Most of their work will be done while at a computer and we can assume web access. 
   $ *Researchers and Scientists*: The people who are running the software packages that will use the storage. Location, first language and work environment may vary widely.
   $ *Installers*: Those who will install the necessary systems software for the SE to interface with the Grid. This could be the same person as the _Storage Systems Administrator_ but it is a different role. Needs task documentation and installation troubleshooting readily at hand during the install.
   $ *Grid Operations Center (GOC)*: A centralized helpdesk for the Grid. Will be working at a workstation. (Access to SEs?)
