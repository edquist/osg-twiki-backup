   $ CA: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCA][Certificate Authority]].

#DefsCampusGrid
   $ Campus Grid: A [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGrid][Grid]] operated within the context of a single [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsFacility][Facility]] (such as a university of a national lab).

   $ CE: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsComputeElement][Compute Element]].

#DefsCEMon
   $ CEMon:  The CEMon service provides a common interface for publishing information about a Compute Element in your network.  The framework can be configured with multiple sensors for collecting different kinds of data, such as the [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGenericInformationProvider][Generic Information Provider]] (GIP). The information can be published in multiple formats, such as the LDAP Data Interchange Format [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsLDIF][LDIF]] and Condor !ClassAds.  In OSG it is an important part if the Information Service (IS): the CEMons running on the resources collect information from the GIP and push it to the Resource Selection Service (!ReSS) and to the CEMon Consumer at the Grid Operations Center [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsGridOperationsCenter][GOC]] that in turn publishes the information to the both the OSG BDII and the WLCG Interoperability BDII.  _See also_ [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php?n=Main.AboutCEMon][About CEMon]].

   $ CE-SE binding:  Job scheduling often requires both a compute element (CE) to run the job and a Storage Element (SE) to provide for an input or output storage extent. Currently , there are static relationships between individual CEs and SEs set by Site Admins. The CE-SE bind schema (part of GLUE schema) aims at providing the means for publishing such a relationship with eventual per-pair data. At the moment, the published information is limited to the local mount point on the CE pointing to the SE's storage space.

#DefsCeStorage
   $ CE Storage:  Disk spaces of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsStorageElement][Storage Elements]] accessible from within a [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsComputeElement][Compute Element]].

#DefsConsumer
   $ Consumer: A [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsUser][User]] or [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsAgent][Agent]] who makes use of an available [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsResource][Resource]] or Agent or Service.

#DefsCPUHours
   $ CPU Hour:  Used to measure processing delivered by [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsComputeElement][Compute Elements]].  A Computer Processing Unit (CPU) hour is one CPU executing a job for one hour of wall clock time.  To get a comparative measure, the hours must be normalized by the relative processing speeds of the CPUs.  

#DefsCertificate
   $ Certificate:  A public-key certificate is a digitally signed statement from one entity (e.g., a certificate authority), saying that the public key (and some other information) of another entity (e.g., the grid user) has some specific value.  The X.509 standard defines what information can go into a certificate, and describes how to write it down (the data format). Read more at Documentation.CertificateWhatIs.

#DefsCRL
   $ Certificate Revocation List (CRL):  A <b>C</b>ertificate <b>R</b>evocation <b>L</b>ist is a list of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCertificate][Certificates]] that have been revoked and should not be relied upon. The list enumerates revoked certificates along with the reason(s) for revocation. The issuer and the issue date are also included. In addition, each list contains a proposed date for its next release. When a potential user attempts to access a server, the server allows or denies access based on the CRL entry for that particular user.  For more information consult [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation_list][Wikipedia]].

#DefsCA
   $ Certificate Authority:  An entity that issues certificates for use by other parties. The OSG recognizes certificates issued by a number of certificate authorities.  _See_ Documentation.CertificateWhatIs.   For more background, consult [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority][Wikipedia]].

   $ Cloud: A set of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsService][Services]], Providers, [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsResource][Resources]] and [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsPolicy][Policies]] providing a single point of access for all the computing needs of [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsConsumer][Consumers]]. The resources are not necessarily owned by the consumer, but may be leased or otherwise accessed.

   $ Cluster: A networked group of worker nodes (plus head node, if applicable) at a site.  In the GLUE schema, a cluster is a container that groups together subclusters, or computer nodes. A cluster may be referenced by more then one computing element (CE).

   $ Community (Cyber-)Infrastructure: A set of services and software that has been established by a community to meet the needs of its members. The management of the distributed infrastructure is the responsibility of the community; and the resources are all, or nearly all, owned by the [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsVo][Virtual Organization]] and its members.

<!--   $ CMS: Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the LHC at CERN (http://cmsinfo.cern.ch/Welcome.html/).
-->
#DefsComputeElement
   $ Compute Element (CE): Compute element  is a term used in Grids to denote any kind of computing interface, e.g., a job entry or batch system.  A compute element consists of one or more similar machines, managed by a single scheduler/job queue, which is set up to accept and run grid jobs.  The machines do not need to be identical, but must have the same OS and the same processor architecture.  In OSG, the CE runs the bulk of the OSG software stack.  _See_ [[Documentation.Release3.SitePlanning][Site Planning]].

   $ Compute Hours: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCPUHours][CPU Hour]]

#DefsCondor
   $ Condor: Condor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive jobs.  Like other full-featured batch systems, Condor provides a job queueing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme, resource monitoring, and resource management.  Condor is a grid middleware component developed at UW Madison, packaged and distributed as part of the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT).  Read more at [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/]]. 

   $ Condor-G: Condor-G is the Grid management part of Condor.   Condor-G provides for submitting jobs to multiple, independently managed, local grids.   OSG uses mostly the "gt2" (Globus) type of grid jobs but Condor-G can also support many other Grid and cloud protocols.

   $ CRL: _See_ [[GlossaryOfTerms#DefsCRL][Certificate Revocation List]].
