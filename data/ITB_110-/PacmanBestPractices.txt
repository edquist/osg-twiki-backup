---++ Installing Pacman
[[PacmanInstall][Information about installing Pacman]] is located elsewhere.

---++ General instructions for using Pacman

If you are familiar with RPM, Pacman may seem a bit strange to you. RPM generally assumes that software is installed once, and in a pre-determined location. Pacman allows you to install software in multiple locations that you select. In order to install software in, say, /opt/osg-%OSG_VERSION%, you switch to that directory and run the Pacman commands there. That is, Pacman installs software in the current directory. For example:

<pre class="screen">
 >mkdir /opt/osg-%OSG_VERSION%  # Feel free to use another location, this is just an example
 >cd /opt/osg-%OSG_VERSION%
 >pacman -get <em>%CACHE%:PACKAGE_NAME</em> # e.g. ce (for %CACHE%)
</pre>

---++ Helpful Pacman options

---+++ Using a web proxy 
If you need to use a web proxy to access web sites, you need to tell Pacman how to use the proxy. This is done with an extra invocation of the =pacman= command before you install software. For example, if your web proxy is proxy.example.com running on port 3128, you can do this:

<pre class="screen">
> pacman -http-proxy http://proxy.example.com:3128
> pacman -get <em>%CACHE%:PACKAGE_NAME</em>
</pre>

---+++ Trusting software caches
When you install software for the first time, Pacman asks you if you trust the [[SoftwareCaches][software caches]] that are used. Because the OSG software stack uses two different software caches, you will be asked twice if you trust the software caches: once for the OSG cache, and once for the VDT cache. 

You can avoid these questions by adding an option =-trust-all-caches=. For example:

<pre class="screen">
> pacman -trust-all-caches -get <em>%CACHE%:PACKAGE_NAME</em>
</pre>

---+++ Installing on an unsupported platform

If you are installing on a platform that isn&rsquo;t officially supported ([[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/requirements.html][list of VDT supported platforms]]) you might be able to install anyway. 

The VDT documentation explains [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced#unsup_plat][how to do this]].

---+++ Installing a 32-bit version on a 64-bit computer

Sometimes you might wish to install the 32-bit version of the VDT but you are installing on a 64-bit operating system. Unless you indicate that you want the 32-bit version, you will get the 64-bit version. 

The VDT documentation explains [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced#pretend_32][how to do this]].

---++ Removing packages with pacman
If you installed a package that you may later have deemed unnecessary, you can remove it by issuing the pacman command with the remove option.

<pre class="screen">
>pacman -remove <em>package_name</em>
</pre>

If you wish to remove a complete installation, you are better just deleting the entire from disk (after turning off your services).

<pre class="screen">
> rm -rf $VDT_LOCATION
</pre>

For details on these commands, see the [[http://physics.bu.edu/pacman][Pacman home page]].

---++ Updating your installation

After you install the OSG software, there may be updates to the software. These updates are for a single OSG or VDT version. For example, VDT version %VDT_VERSION% may be updated to %VDT_VERSION% %VDT_VERSION%b. These updates provide bug fixes. 

The process for updating is always well described by the GOC and the VDT team, but the basic procedure is that you run a series of =pacman -update= commands, once for each software component that needs to be updated. 

We recommend that you backup your installation before you update it. While the update process normally goes smoothly, a backup will be immeasurably helpful if there are problems. You can backup your installation like this:

<pre class="screen">
cp -pr $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP_LOCATION
</pre>

The -p option for cp will preserve permissions and ownerships, and is essential for a proper backup.

---++ Don&rsquo;t mix versions
Under no circumstances should you mix software from different versions of the VDT. (Updates within a single version are fine). For example, if have installed an OSG 0.6, which is based on VDT 1.6.1, and you wish to install an extra package from VDT %VDT_VERSION%, do not do it. It won&rsquo;t work correctly.

---++ Use versioned directories
A good practice is to install into  a versioned directory. For example install into /usr/local/osg-%VERSION% and then symlink /usr/local/osg to the correct location.

---++ Troubleshooting installations

---+++ Finding the source of the failure.

When you do an installation, it might fail. We try hard (really!) to prevent errors, but they still happen. Our sincere apologies if this happens to you. 

Unfortunately, Pacman errors are often cryptic and misleading. Probably more than half of all Pacman error messages that users see do not help you understand the error. Fortunately, there is additional information you can look at.

While the OSG software is installed, a log file is created that records nearly everything that happens. This log file is long and may not be easy to understand, but it can be very useful. The log file is called =vdt-install.log=, and it is in the directory where you are doing the installation.

If your installation fails, look in =vdt-install.log= to see if there are any obvious errors. In most cases, the interesting error messages will come at the end of the log file. 

Even if you do not understand the error, the error might help you make a better [[TroubleTickets][request for help]].

---+++ Setup file issues
In some cases when you do multiple installations with Pacman (that is, you do multiple =-pacman -get= commands in a single directory) or when you do a =pacman -updat=, the setup files (setup.sh and setup.csh) might be damaged if there is an error. 

You can attempt to recreate the files with the following command:
<pre class="screen">
>pacman -setup
</pre>

---++ Learning more about Pacman

The [[http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/][Pacman web site]] has [[http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/htmls/][a decent manual]] where you can learn more details about Pacman.
