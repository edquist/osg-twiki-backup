---++ A Software Cache

For most of the software in the OSG software stack (dCache is a notable exception), we use Pacman to install software. We tell Pacman what software to install by describing it in a set of web-accessible documents. This set of descriptions combined with the software itself is called a _software cache_. 

In general you do not need to understand the details of a software cache, but if you are curious you can see some examples:

   * The VDT's description of how to install Squid: %VDT_CACHE_URL%/Squid.pacman
   * The OSG's description of how to install the Computing Element: %OSG_CACHE_URL%/ce.pacman

Wait a minute--why are there two software caches involved here, one for the VDT and one for OSG? 

---++ OSG and VDT Software Caches

The [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/][Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT)]] is a subproject of OSG. The VDT provides the underlying software stack for the OSG, but also provides software to other grids. While we could keep all of the OSG software in a single software cache, we separate it into two caches. The goal of the VDT software cache is to be grid-agnostic: the software should be usable by any grid. The OSG software stack is a thin layer on top of the VDT that does two things: it selects the subset of the VDT that OSG uses, and it provides OSG-specific configuration.

   * Nearly all of the software distributed by the OSG comes from the VDT. 
   * [[VdtRelease][More information about VDT %VDT_VERSION%]]
