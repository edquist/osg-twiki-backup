---++ Install Worker Node Client
%EDITTHIS%

This is a minimal set of executables that need to be made available to the worker nodes in a Compute Element. It must be installed in a location on the CE visible to jobs executing on the worker node. 
d39 1
Note that it contains some packages that are not part of the CE package. 

<pre class="screen">
[root@fgitb-cm grid]# <b>vdt-version </b>
You have installed a subset of VDT version 1.6.1:
    CA Certificates v21 (includes IGTF 1.11 CAs)
    cURL 7.16.0
    Fetch CRL 2.6.2
    Globus Toolkit, pre web-services, client 4.0.3
    Globus Toolkit, web-services, client 4.0.3
    GPT 3.2
    Java SDK 1.4.2_12
    Java 5 SDK 1.5.0_09
    Logrotate 3.7
    RLS, client 3.0.041021
    SRM V1 Client 1.25
    SRM V2 Client 2.1
    UberFTP 1.22
    Wget 1.10.2
</pre>


These client programs need to be available from the worker node so that jobs which need to access grid-enabled mass storage during the job (e.g. via globus-url-copy, VDS, or srmcp) can do so.  The worker node also has to have either via NFS or locally a good set of certificate authority files with up to date certificate revocation lists (CRL's) for those clients to work properly.

---++ Installation Options
There are two installation options:

   1. _Suggested Installation:_ Install the wn-client package on the file server separate from the CE that you use for $APP. You will be installing the fetch-crl program onto this node, which requires root access, and adds a script into cron . The updates require outgoing network access from the node it is installed on.  (Should arrange to make it accessible from the CE as well). %BR% %BR%  
   2. _CE installation:_ Install the wn-client package on your CE. While we do not suggest you do this, we provide instructions, and support this installation as an option.  

There is actually a third option: you can use some mechanism of your choice to install the software on each node. However, if you do this, do *not* run the fetch-crl program on each node. If all worker nodes in OSG run fetch-crl, it may create high load on the CRL web servers. If they are synchronized, it may be indistinguishable from a denial of service attack. It is better to use something like rsync to copy the CA certificates and CRLs from another local node that fetches them regularly. We plan for a future version of the OSG software stack to include a facility to do this reliably.  It is also possible to use the Squid package, available from the VDT to cache the Certificates and CRL updates and reduce the load.

In all cases you need to choose a path that is common to all worker nodes and the CE. You will be prompted for this path when running the =configure-osg.sh= script on the gatekeeper in order to set the =$OSG_GRID= variable.

Do you want to run a cron job that will update the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b>l</b>
......

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible Answers:
     y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
        this one..
     n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
        run this one.

The installation will first ask if you trust the pacman caches, and then if you agree to the VDT licenses.  

It then asks where you would like to install the CA files and whether to run the fetch-crl cron script.
It then asks where you would like to install the CA files and whether to run the fetch-crl cron script. There are a couple of options:
---++++ Option 1
---+++ !Option 1
For the suggested installation option, i.e. option (1) where you install this worker node client package on the file server that serves $APP, and you have no previous installation of the fetch-crl cron script, you should answer =l= (lowercase letter L) for the location and =y= to run the fetch-crl cron.
---++++ Option 2
---+++ !Option 2
If you are installing this worker node client on the OSG CE, i.e. option (2) answer =l= (lowercase letter L) for local location of CRL and =n= on running the cron script.

If the OSG WN client is installed along with some other VDT package on any given node, the CE for instance, as in option 2, you should do the following steps afterwards.

Look at =crontab -l= for root, make sure that the fetch-crl that is there is running from the correct area. Make sure that it's sourcing the correct location.

For example, if the OSG CE is installed in =/usr/local/vdt= , then the OSG WN Client is installed in =/usr/local/grid=
d162 1

Look at the =/usr/local/grid/globus/TRUSTED_CA= link. It should point to the real area where your certificates will live, in this example =/usr/local/vdt/globus/share/certificates= . If it doesn't, change it to that location.


<pre class="screen">
[root@fgtest3 globus]# <b>pwd </b>
/usr/local/grid/globus
[root@fgtest3 globus]# <b>ls -l TRUSTED_CA </b>
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 41 Mar 16 15:44 TRUSTED_CA -> /usr/local/grid/globus/share/certificates
[root@fgtest3 globus]# <b>rm TRUSTED_CA </b>
[root@fgtest3 globus]# <b>ln -s /usr/local/vdt/globus/share/certificates TRUSTED_CA </b>
</pre>

Also note, if Condor is involved, should also make a symlink from =/etc/grid-security/certificate= to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= .
%NOTE% If Condor is used as the job manager, you should also make a symlink from =/etc/grid-security/certificates= to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= .
---++Notes

---++ Notes
%IMPORTANT% If you are installing this package on a head node / compute element where an OSG CE install will also be done afterwards, it is recommended that you log out and log back in before continuing with the main OSG CE Install, otherwise all the wn-client stuff will be in your path and confuse everything.

---++Alternative Viewpoint and Approach

---++ Alternative Viewpoint and Approach

Installation of the worker node client package does imply maintenance of the certificates that it installs.  
It is possible to rsync either the full worker node client package to the worker nodes, or just the
CA certificate directory found in $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA.  This eliminates the 
need to do multiple pacman updates every time a new CA-Certificates package comes out, which 
is on the average of every couple of months.  

It is not enough to rsync the OSG CE installation, or NFS-mount it to the worker nodes.  The Worker 
Node client package now contains software that is not in the base OSG CE installation and VO's are
expecting it to be there, so it must be made available somewhere.

Doing anything automatically on the worker nodes requires care.  An example script that looks to see what worker nodes on a cluster using pbsnodes is attached to this page.  It can be edited or replaced with a more general version to match your specific cluster conditions.  Note that the example script does not use the batch system itself, but uses a feature of the local batch scheduler to avoid trying to push certificates to worker nodes that are down and to build a list of operating nodes to receive the update.  To use this script with the greatest amount of integration into existing certificate update procedures, it can be called just after the edg-fetch-crl call in the edg/sbin/edg-crl-upgrade script that should be in the edg/sbin area of your OSG VDT installation.  Example code to do so would look like:

<pre class="programlisting">
# Add section to upgrade the worker nodes:
    if [ -x $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/wn-cert-sync ]; then
        $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/wn-cert-sync -l $CRL_UPGRADE_PATH -q
    else
        echo "In edg-crl-upgrade: Worker node certificates not synchronized! "
    fi
</pre>

where =wn-cert-sync= is a soft link to your particular cluster's worker node certificate synchronization script, as in the example attached. (Customize one to your cluster configuration.)
   * This issue deserves further discussion and repair in the current OSG releases.
