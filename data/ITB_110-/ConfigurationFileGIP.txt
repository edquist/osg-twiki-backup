---++ Introduction to GIP Section

This section gives information about the options in the GIP section of the configuration file.

---++ Options

The options given in bold type are mandatory.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *batch* | String | This should give the name of the batch system in use on this CE.  It should be one of pbs, fbs, sge, lsf, or condor. |
| *advertise_gums* | =True=, =False= | If you want GIP to query your gums server set this to True, otherwise set this to False. |
| *advertise_gsiftp* | =True=, =False= | If you want GIP to advertise your gridftp server set this to True, otherwise set this to False. |
| gsiftp_host  | String | This should be set to the name of the gridftp server GIP will advertise if the advertise_gridftp setting is set to True. |
| gsiftp_path  | String | This is the location on the gsiftp server that incoming data can be placed in. This should should be set to OSG_DATA if your gsiftp server is your CE. |
| *srm* | =True=, =False= | This setting indicates whether you have a SE associated with this CE whose information you would like GIP to publish.  Set this to True or False. |
| se_name | String | If you want GIP to publish on your SE, then you should fill in the  registered OSG name of the SE in the next setting (e.g. UC_ITB_SE) . If srm is set to True, then this is required. | 
| se_host  | String | If srm is set to True, then this should be set to the hostname of your SE. | 
| srm_implementation | String | If srm is set to True, then this setting should have the  SRM implementation that you are using (e.g. dcache, bestman, etc) | 
| dynamic_dcache | =True=, =False= | If you are using a dcache based se, GIP can query it dynamically to obtain the values it should advertise, however you'll need to do some other configuration in order to accomplish this See https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/InformationServices/DcacheGip  if you have enabled this setting.  This should be set to True or False. |
| srm_version | String | If you are advertising a SE through GIP, this setting should have the version of your srm implementation (e.g. 1.8.0-12pl4) | 
| se_access_number | Integer | This setting gives the number of gsiftp access points available for your SE |
| se_access_version | String | Set this to the protocol version that should be used to access your SE. Set to 1.0.0 for gsiftp and 2.0.0 for gsiftp2 .  This should probably be set to 1.0.0 |
| se_access_endpoints | String | Set this option to the urls endpoints of your SE's gsiftp  servers separated by commas if you have multiple servers  (e.g. gsiftp://ftp.host1:port,gsiftp://ftp.host2:port) |
| se_control_version | String | Set this setting with the protocol version that your SE supports  e.g. 1.1.0, 2.2.0 | 
| se_root_path | String | Set this to the path to the base path to your SE's storage area.  E.g. /pnfs/your.site/data| 
| simplified_srm  | =True=, =False= | If you want all VOs to use a single path on your SE enable this setting below, otherwise set this to False|
| vo_dir | String | This directory will give the suffix that should be applied to the se_root_path  setting above.   If you enabled the simplified_srm setting, set  this to the path that all VOs should use. If you are using VO specific directories, enter the path that VOs should use, PLEASE NOTE: VONAME in the path will be replaced with the VOs actual name.  The VOs that will be advertised are obtained from the osg-user-vo-map.txt file. E.g. if you are enabled the simplified_srm setting and set se_root_path to /pnfs/myhost/data and set this setting to vo_location, then the path used by VOs would be /pnfs/myhost/data/vo_location |
| special_vo_dir | String | This option allows directories for specific VOs to be entered directly.  This should be done using the following format: vo1:/vo1/dir,vo2:/vo2/dir  | 
| *sc_number* | Number | Enter the number of subclusters that your CE has below. This should be an integer greater than or equal to 1 | 

For each subcluster , enter cluster information by entering the options followed by a numeric label for each option. All the information should be for the worker nodes in the cluster.  The numeric label used should be less than or equal to the sc_number setting. The information needed is:

| Option | Values Accepted | Description |
| sc_name_# | String | Should be the name of the subcluster| 
| sc_vendor_# | String | Should be the cpu vendor (e.g. Genuine Intel, Authentic AMD, etc.) |
| sc_model_# | String | Should be the model of the cpu as return by /proc/cpuinfo (e.g. Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 275) | 
| sc_clock_# | Number | Should be the clock speed of the cpu in Hz |
| sc_numlcpus_# | Number | Should be the number of logical cpus on the nodes in the cluster |
| sc_numpcpus_# | Number | Should be the number of physical cpus on the nodes in the cluster |
| sc_ramsize_# | Number | Should be the ram available in MB (e.g. 4192) |
| sc_inbound_# | =True=, =False= | Should be true or false depending on whether inbound connectivity is available |
| sc_outbound_# | =True=, =False= | Should be true or false depending on whether inbound connectivity is available |
| sc_nodes_# | Number | Should be the number of worker nodes available in the cluster |

Additional options can be set and passed through to the =gip-attributes.conf= by entering this as <pre>OSG_GIP_MY_SETTING = foo</pre> in the gip configuration section.
