---++ Validating Syslog-ng
   * Syslog-ng comes preconfigured to forward the following logfiles to a collection host at UC.  It is not installed by default - you have to install and configure it using instructions *here*.
      * ...
   * After you've finished the install/config, it will begin forwarding logfile data automatically.  Send an email to Suchandra. 
   * Upon receiving confirmation from Suchandra, enter  %Y% in the validation table for your site.
   * Also check /tmp/syslog-ng.log and check the log statistics entries to verify that messages were sent to the central host (e.g.   =processed='destination(central_dest)=2031'= where the number is non-zero )
