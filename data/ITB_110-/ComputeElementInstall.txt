---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to  [[OsgCEAuthorization][Osg CE Authorization]] document and authorize other users before performing the *OSG Registration* of your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!).  You should do this before doing the rest of the monitoring configuration steps below, otherwise you may  have to repeat the steps later, particularly if your site is using GUMS.
