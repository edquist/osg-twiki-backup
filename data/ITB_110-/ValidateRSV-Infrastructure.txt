---+ ITBers - what to look for?
   * Go to [[http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/vdt-package.html#test_output][Testers: What to look for?]] section of the documentation.
      * As outlined in that section, look for status.html file as well as success in uploading database records (i.e. probe output is reported back to a central Gratia based database at the GOC) 
   * If the tests outlined in above link succeed, make %Y% entry in the validation table for your site.
   * If these tests are not clear, please send email to Arvind Gopu and cc osg-int@opensciencegrid.org.
