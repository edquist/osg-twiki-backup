---++ Introduction
This topic discusses site-level service monitoring (of compute elements, eg.) that is collected and monitored centrally.

---++ VORS
As it pertains to monitoring sites, VORS (the web interface) runs a program called gridscan that runs the equivalent of the site-verify script every few hours.  Detailed results are displayed as hyperlinks off the VORS page for a particular site.

---++ The GOC RSV Collector
In OSG the RSV system, as installed on %CACHE% %VERSION% compute elements, reports locally scheduled probe results to a central collector operated by the GOC.  At present there is no web-visible monitor for this service, but it is monitored by the GOC staff.

---++ Nagios consoles
A set of Nagios probe wrappers designed for RSV probe output is being prepared, and should be available in an RSV community probe respository.  The Nagios probes can be used for site-level Nagios consoles that may be in use for local fabric monitoring (eg. define an OSG service group) or they may be reported to facility-wide Nagios monitors.  At present, there is no OSG-wide Nagios console, but some VOs run these for their facilities and may find these probes useful.
