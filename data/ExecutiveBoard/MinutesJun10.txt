		* LCG Interoperability is proceeding. ATLAS and CMS jobs are being run on LCG and TeraGrid as well on OSG. LCG Interoperability is structured using the GlueSchema,  GIP, RB to gateway between LCG and OSG. LCG looks like a single site and everything sent towards the OSG is gatewayed through one node through the LCG and vice-versa. Iowa doing this work for CMS. Will distribute jobs at the backend. Collect all the monitoring information in a central place and doing the translation. Ruth should post the documents and get some more information posted. Documentation needed. Next phone con is Thur 16th. TeraGrid DAC - exploratory allocation. cycles at Purdue, TACC, ANL. Greg Cross, Chris, Shaowen - running ATLAS and CMS applications on TeraGrid resources, but need to address finer details of job monitoring. Late June hope to have rough ideas on this. Will submit a much larger allocation requests in July. CMS user can submit jobs to the TeraGrid? No automatic job migration from OSG to TeraGrid resource. Recommendation that before larger allocation request the a) Authentication b) Authorization b) Policy and c) Job Scheduling gateways are solved. This application is regarded as a Science Gateway by TeraGrid. We need to use this as a means to define a partner grid. currently installing applications on the TeraGrid and gateway jobs. Any larger allocation for US CMS would need to have successful tests from Craig for production etc. 
	  Are there any policy type show stoppers: Difficulties are the VO group accounts and representation; Accounting for a class of user;
