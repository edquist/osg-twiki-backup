   * Alains question:

I'm not sure what this text means at a technical level: "Add first pass packaging and distribution to support VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo software installation: The OSG software model is of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo scoped and managed environments on shared and opportunistically available resources. Each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo installs their application middleware in a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo specific storage area $OSG_APP. To date the OSG software stack is statically installed into a common area accessible to all VOs. In the next year we will provide collections of VDT and OSG software that will provide common modules for VOs to include in their own installations. This will set the stage for the longer term goal of dynamic "on-the-fly" installation of both OSG and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo software."
