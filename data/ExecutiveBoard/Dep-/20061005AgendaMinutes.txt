Regular status reports. Should we be more explicit? put section of the management plan the status reports is in.  Do we want to send it past the CIO of the institution before sending to the Executive Team? They will get it from the contracts office. Will send the Caltech SOW to the ET.

Users Group and User Coordination activities. 
This is a very important area; we have an interim User Coordinator in Ilya, we are discussing a potential longer term Users Coordinator in Jerome, we have "large VO identified  liaisons" on the Executive Team. But this is  Very Important work and it must be given the priority, effort and attention it needs as we move forward.
