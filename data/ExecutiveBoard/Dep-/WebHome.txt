Welcome to the  <b>%WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB%</b>.

The Deployment Activity responds to the stakeholder requirements and develops and executes the plan for deployment of the OSG infrastructure. The Deployment Activity receives versions of the OSG Infrastructure which area readied, and decides whether they should be deployed. The Deployment Activity reviews individual readiness plans for completion.

The Stakeholders are represented by the co-chairs of the Technical Groups and Activities and the "VO Liaisons" who are:

	* ATLAS : Razvan Popescu
	* CDF : tbd
	* CMS : Frank Wuerthwein
	* D0 : Joel Snow
	* Fermilab : ?
	* fMRI : Jed Dobson
	* GADU : Mike Wilde
	* GRASE : Mark Green
	* LIGO : Kent Blackburn
	* SDSS : Neha Sharma
	* SLAC ; Booker Bense
	* STAR : Jerome Lauret

These Liaisons are expected to attend Deployment Meetings to participate in Decisions such as whether releases are ready for Deployment. It is expected that a VO Liaison can speak for the VO in such decision making. There is no separate mailling list or mailings for VO Liaisons. If a higher level management decision is needed the issue is sent to the Executive Board and  Council of the OSG.

(An action item is to understand the relationship (if any) of the VO Liaison to the Deployment activity to the "VO Manager" as registered when the VO registers to Operations.)

 Here are the MeetingMinutes
