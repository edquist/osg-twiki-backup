-- might you be able to give the first report about CEDS-OSG at this phone meeting (presentations of no more than 5 slides)? If you have a conflict it would be great if you could post a presentation and we will read through it since several people in OSG are part of CEDS with related hats??<br>

thats 9 items in 3 hours. Seems plenty to me. 


Note that things like the OSG 0.6.0 release are discussed weekly in the Facility Coordination and Executive Team meetings so I am not including them here. The ET,  Integration, Operations, Troubleshooting meetings have minutes posted on the twiki and you are invited to read them there and send questions to this EBP list.
