During the remainder of May and June we worked on the revised budgets and prelinary project execution plan. Members of the Executive Team attended, and in some cases helped organize, various workshops with our partners : Joint Security Meeting; EGEE Joint Operations Workshop; TeraGrid06; Grid Summer School. 

We are working towards a full project plan for Year 1 of the OSG project, to be reviewed at the Council meeting on 24th August.
