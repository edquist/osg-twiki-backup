---++GlueCE Attributes

dn: !GlueCEUniqueID=CE_FQDN:2119/jobmanager-batch-queue,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid 

*NOTES*:
   1. For a non pbs based batched system we use the jobmanager-batch-vo, instead of jobmanager-batch-queue
   1. This was done for interoperability with EGEE, but it is likely that we can simplify it in future
   1. Currently port number is hard-coded. May need to change.
   1. Dynamic scripts that update CE information include:
      * osg-info-dynamic-pbs
      * osg-info-dynamic-condor
      * osg-info-dynamic-sge
      * osg-info-dynamic-lsf
