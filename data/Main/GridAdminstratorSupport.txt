OSG Site, Resource and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Administrators are an important part of making the distributed facility work, test new services, software and configurations, and communicate with and help each other.

The osg-general* mail list is a good source of information and discussion and the osg-int* is The place for the Integration Infrastructure and testing of new software.

The [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/WebHome][Monitoring]] page has lots of good links.
