---+!! *Bosco and Campus Factory Integration*


| *Summary* | *Effort Prediction* | *Overview* |
| Add campus factory to =condor_contrib= | 2 days | Adding the campus factory to the =condor_contrib= will simplify building and packaging of the bosco package |
| Modify Bosco Install | 1 day | The installation needs to install the campus factory along with bosco.  This will require modifying =bosco_install=. |
| Modify Bosco auto-configuration | 4 hours | The auto-configuration will need to also send campus factory bits to the remote host | 
| Modify Bosco initial configuration | 1 day | Bosco needs to have a full deployment of condor, Collector, Negotiator, Schedd.  Also, it needs to be setup to allow password authentication, the auto configured method of security for the campus factory. | 
| Campus Factory modifications | ?? hours | The campus factory will need to be modified to choose from either a "new" local install of Condor, or to use an existing Condor. and utilize the correct daemons |
