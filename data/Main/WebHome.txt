---++ Introduction
Our collaborative workspace is this TWiki, of which you are at the home page.  Work in OSG is done in "Activities" coordinated through this TWiki, regularly scheduled phone conferences, and [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Using_the_OSG/Consortium_Mailing_Lists][mailing lists]].  All of these communication modes are open to new members. 

Our TWiki comprises separate "webs" for each of the technical activities, for documentation, and for other "hands-on" topics.  Technical activities typically keep meeting minutes, to-do lists, and other administrative info in their webs.  

On this page, in addition to pointers to the different areas of the TWiki, you'll find information on [[#Getting_Started_using_TWiki][how to get started using TWiki]].

---++Getting Started using TWiki
Only a few simple things are necessary to get started. 
---+++ Register to edit pages
First, [[TWiki.TWikiRegistration][Register]]. To edit pages on this twiki site, you must have a registered user name and password. It's simple, and only takes a minute. This will also create your personal home page. Consult the [[TWiki.WelcomeGuest][Welcome Guest]] which covers the TWiki basics.
---+++ Learn to edit topics
*Edit Access control* will be given by the site administrator for editing %MAINWEB% and other topics. While you wait, you can *get started immediately* with the [[Sandbox.WebHome][Sandbox]].  

To edit content, click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of any page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text according to TWiki markup, click 'Preview' to see, then (if it looks ok) click 'Save'.  Click "Checkpoint" to save while continuing to edit. 
---+++ Create new pages
Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord in a topic. Once the topic is saved, the topic-to-be is denoted by a ? after the word. Clicking on the ? to create the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').

Another way is to create a TWiki.WikiWord in the "Jump" box, then click "Create" on the page that appears in order to create the new page with the name you entered.
---+++ About editing topics
The TWiki is a collaborative work area.  Within pages associated with your area of expertise and/or interest, you should feel free to add information that you think will help, to correct erroneous information, and to delete obsolete information.  (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!
