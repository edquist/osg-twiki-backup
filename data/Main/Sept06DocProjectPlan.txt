---+ OSG Documentation Project Plan Notes

---++ Requirements 
   * Must use TWiki (http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome)
   * Current, complete, universally accessible, high-availability technical documentation for all users/members of OSG
   * Supplementary, qualitative information on how the various pieces of OSG fit together
   * Modularized documentation topics (to avoid duplication of information)
   * Archiving for each version, by VDT release
   * Editable by many OSG members
   * Guidance for reader to identify what type of user he/she is, and what documentation to follow
   * Easy navigation to appropriate documentation
   * Tested, easy-to-follow instructions

---++ Participants

---+++ Technical writers
Anne Heavey, Forrest Christian (new contractor)

---+++ Documentation Activity participants
   * Kyle Gross, TWiki configuration and maintenance issues
   * Rob Quick, 
   * Kevin Munday, Marcia Teckenbrock, coordination with OSG website

---+++ Experts in various OSG subject areas 
(I'll need guidance and volunteers here; these are just my guesses):
   * Mike Wilde, EOT
   * Paul Avery, new user
   * Alain Roy, VDT
   * Eileen Berman, storage
   * John Weigand, CE
   * Doug Olson, Eric Shook, VOMS
   * Marco Mambelli, monitoring

   * others...

---+++ Consortium leadership
   * guidance and review

---++ Content needed for each audience
Contained in "docinventory.xml" matrix

---++ List of Tasks
   * Complete "docinventory.xml" matrix
   * Get agreement on matrix
   * Define structure of user doc TWiki
   * Get agreement on structure
   * Convert KBase info to TWiki topics
   * Move/rename existing TWiki topics as necessary
   * Edit/update existing TWiki topics as necessary  (to be assigned according to expertise)
   * Create new TWiki topics for missing information  (to be assigned according to expertise)
   * Identify external documents to link to, as necessary
   * Create links from main OSG site to TWiki topics as necessary

---++ Schedule 
In order to create a schedule:
   * Complete docinventory matrix
   * Estimate time for each item on matrix
   * Assign work to individuals (and see how it fits in with their other priorities)

---++ Maintenance
   * Coordinate with new VDT releases
   * Assign one expert (maybe a backup, too) to each topic
   * Expert expected to figure out how the new VDT release changes the doc he/she is responsible for.
   * If minor changes required, expert should make them, and retest doc
   * If significant changes required, expert can coordinate with tech writer to accomplish update and retest.
   * Editor of topic (expert or tech writer) should notify doc activity when update/retest is completed.
   * How best to keep track of what's updated and what's still in need?
