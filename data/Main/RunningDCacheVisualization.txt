---++ Running the !dCache visualization in the ROC.

---+++ Installing
dCache Visualization requires [[http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html][Xcode]] and [[http://www.libsdl.org/][SDL]].  Xcode is free, but requires sign up.  Xcode has an mac automated installer.  SDL is an open source library for cross platform rendering that is best built from source.

---++++ Install SDL
   1. Download the SDL source tarball from [[http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php][SDL 1.2 Download]].  
   1. Open a terminal on the Mac, and change to the directory with the SDL.  If using firefox, it will be in =~/Downloads=.
   <pre class="screen">
