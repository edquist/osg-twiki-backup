What is the OSG?

The Open Science Grid is a national computing infrastructure for science co-funded by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

The Open Science Grid contributes to the World Wide LHC Computing Grid as the US infrastructure on which the LHC experiments depend. OSG collaborates in this Collaboration together with EGEE and NGDF National Grid Infrastructures.

By leveraging advanced software technologies, OSG brings together computing and data resources across campus, regional, national and international boundaries. More than 50 independent provider sites %GREEN%(MT: will check numbers; think they're closer to 70 sites from more than 26 states)%ENDCOLOR% from more than 23 states in the US contribute to the power of the OSG.

OSG is an expanding alliance of universities, national laboratories, scientific collaborations and software developers.

OSG builds bridges to move data and jobs between infrastructures &ndash; including the EGEE in Europe and TeraGrid in the US, as well as internally and between University Campuses. OSG enables researchers to harness resources that span national and international boundaries.
