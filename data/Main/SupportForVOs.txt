About VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Administrators

The term "VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Administrator" potentially covers 2 separate roles:

   * manager of the registration of users and their associated roles in the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS database.
   * administrator of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Server

As VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators of the first kind, you will need to register the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo with OSG and provide information on the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo specific processes.

As VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators of the second kind, you will need to setup the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo specific services.

Register your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo with OSG

To form a Virtual Organization (VO) that participates in the Open Science Grid one needs the following:

   1. a Charter statement describing the purpose of the VO. This should be short yet concise enough to scope intended usage of OSG resources.
   2. at least one VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo participating Organization that is a member or partner with the Open Science Grid Consortium.
   3. a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Membership Service which meets the requirements of an OSG Release. This means being able to provide a full list of members' DNs to edg-mkgridmap. The currently recommended way to do this is to deploy the VDT VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS from the OSG software package.
   4. a support organization (called a Support Center in OSG parlance) that will support the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in OSG Operations. The Support Center should provide at least the following:
          * a written description of the registration process,
          * instructions for the members of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo on how to complete the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo registration process,
          * instructions for the members of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo on how to report problems and/or obtain help.
   5. completion of the [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][registration form]] located here using [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/RegistrationInstructions][these instructions]]

About VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS

All OSG VOs are required to have a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS (Virtual Organization Membership Service) for their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and will need a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrator to manage their service. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is the only *required* VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo specific service for OSG.
