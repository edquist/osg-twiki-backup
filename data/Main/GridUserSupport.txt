---++User Support

The Users of the OSG are what makes it all hum. Users are members of Virtual Organizations and usually you get your support through contacting your VO support.  On this page we aim to share information about the use of OSG and the user information - mainly as pointers. But don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions and comments:

The users mail list:   osg-users*@... and mail archive.  Everyone can go to Community Support (osg-general*@...) for help also.

Remember that the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/WebHome][Monitoring]] page points you to information about how OSG is performing - both now and over the past periods.

The Grid Operations Center keeps the trouble tickets - go [[SupportCenters] [here]] to find out all about it.
