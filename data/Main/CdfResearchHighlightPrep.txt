expansion of the CDF computing to the Open Science Grid (OSG) during the last 6 months CDF was able to consume more CPU resources than any other experiment, you can  find 'by experiment' OSG CPU consumption plot at the CDF tiki:
http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/tiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=19 (I don't have authorization to view this).

Ability to use practically unlimited today off-site computing for MC  generation had huge impact on the physics productivity of the 
experiment in 2006.
   * In a short time our physicists were able to generate a lot of MC necessary for the data analysis.
   * Having moved time-consuming MC generation offsite we were  able to use more on-site CPU resources for the data analysis and use 
 proximity of these CPUs to the data to increase efficiency and shorten the time of the data analysis.

 GRID expansion of the CDF computing was one of the building blocks underlying success of our physics and leading to multiple  important  physics results reported by CDF in 2006. This is a tremendous achievement of the CDF GRID team which has already made available to us North-American (NAmCAF) and European  GRID (LCGCAF) resources and just recently started working on PacCAF  which will allow CDF to access GRID computing sites in Asia.

---+++ Anne's questions
   * when was this written
   * how much is "practically unlimited"?
   * Explain CAF, NAmCAF and how it relates to OSG
   * Numbers (maybe they're in the image), how many MC jobs, CPU cycles, TBytes, what units are best?

---+++ Katie's suggested questions

   * How did the grid help the collaboration make the recent  discoveries of B sub s mixing and the Sigma sub b particles?
   * How, exactly, is CDF using the OSG? How many sites? What's the amount of usage?
   * How long has CDF been using the OSG? 
   * What are the future plans of CDF and the OSG?

---++ Spokespersons for Physics side

   * what does mixing mean? Contrast with oscillation.
   * what are component particles of B sub s meson?
   * how was the oscillation detected and measured?
   * how did use of OSG software and resources help make this discovery possible?
   * what does the plot show?
   * what would you state as the significance of B sub S result?
   * how does this discovery fit in with the goals of CDF?

...announced (September 25, 2006) that they have met the exacting standard to claim discovery of astonishingly rapid transitions between matter and antimatter: 3 trillion oscillations per second.

The CDF discovery of the oscillation rate is immediately significant for two major reasons: reinforcing the validity of the Standard Model, which governs physicists' understanding of the fundamental particles and forces; and narrowing down the possible forms of supersymmetry, a theory proposing that each known particle has its own more massive "super" partner particle. (The currently popular models of supersymmetry, for example, predict a much higher transition frequency than that observed by CDF, and those models will need to be reconsidered. )

"Scientists have been pursuing this measurement for two decades, but the convergence of capabilities to make it possible has occurred just now," said CDF cospokesperson Jacobo Konigsberg of the University of Florida. "We needed to produce sufficient quantities to be able to study these particles in detail. That condition was met by the superb performance of the Tevatron. Then, with a process this fast, we needed extremely precise detectors and sophisticated analysis tools. Those conditions were met at CDF, along with the skill and contributions of a great team of people." 

Scientists hope that by assembling a large number of precise measurements involving the exotic behavior of these particles (matter and antimatter, especially as it pertains to strange, charm and bottom quarks), they can begin to understand why they exist, how they interact with one another and what role they played in the development of the early universe. Most importantly, they could also be the place in which to look for new physics beyond the Standard Model, which scientists believe is incomplete.

The experimenters acquired their data between February 2002 and January 2006, an operating period known as Tevatron Run 2,

Surprisingly, the bizarre behavior of the B_s (pronounced "B sub s") mesons is actually predicted by the Standard Model of fundamental particles and forces. The discovery of this oscillatory behavior is thus another reinforcement of the Standard Model's durability.

Developing the software tools to make maximal use of the information in each collision takes time and effort," said Roser, "but the rewards are there in terms of discovery potential and increased level of precision."

announced today (October 23, 2006) the discovery of two rare types of particles, exotic relatives of the much more common proton and neutron. 

The CDF collaboration discovered two types of Sigma-sub-b particles, each one about six times heavier than a proton. 

The two types of baryons discovered by the CDF experiment are made of two up quarks and one bottom quark (u-u-b), and two down quarks and a bottom quark (d-d-b). For comparison, protons are u-u-d combinations, while neutrons are d-d-u. The new particles are extremely short-lived and decay within a tiny fraction of a second.

The CDF experiment identified 103 u-u-b particles, positively charged Sigma-sub-b particles (&#931;+b), and 134 d-d-b particles, negatively charged Sigma-sub-b particles (&#931;-b). In order to find this number of particles, scientists culled through more than 100 trillion high-energy proton-antiproton collisions produced by the Tevatron over the last five years. 

the two types of Sigma-sub-b particles are produced in two different spin combinations, J=1/2 and J=3/2, representing a ground state and an excited state, as predicted by theory. 

Quark theory predicts six different types of baryons with one bottom quark and spin J=3/2 (see graphic). The CDF experiment now accounts for two of these baryons.

Three trillion times per second -- that's how fast the B sub S particle has been measured to change between its matter and antimatter states. This rapid change back and forth is called "oscillation" or "mixing". The Collider Detector at Fermilab, CDF, a high energy particle detector housed along the beamline of the world's most powerful particle accelerator, has achieved the convergence of capabilities to make this discovery possible. "We needed to produce sufficient quantities (of data) to be able to study these particles in detail. That condition was met by the superb performance of the Tevatron," said CDF cospokesperson Jacobo Konigsberg of the University of Florida, referring to the accelerator.  "Then, with a process this fast, we needed extremely precise detectors and sophisticated analysis tools.  Those conditions were met at CDF, along with the skill and contributions of a great team of people."  In addition to the B sub S mixing frequency, CDF has recently discovered two new types of 3-quark particles (called baryons): a u-u-b quark combination resulting in a positively charged Sigma-sub-b particle, and its negatively charged counterpart composed of d-d-b quarks.  Use of OSG resources has helped pave the way for these discoveries.  CDF computing experts Ashutosh .. and Pasha .. stressed that "The ability to use practically unlimited off-site computing had a huge impact on the physics productivity of the experiment in 2006."
