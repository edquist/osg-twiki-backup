   * Updated each night using cronjob on uct3-edge2 under ivdgl user account
   * Can force a resync by running =/home/osgvo/ivdgl/scripts/generate-cache-files.py= as ivdgl
   * To add new version for vtb release:
      * create a new branch labeled with the version number in svn repository
      * edit =generate-cache-files.py= and add the branch in branches definition near top of file (e.g. =branches = ['1.5.2', '1.6.0', ... ]=
      * populate branch in svn repository with package files (shortver and longver in file names will get replaced with xyz or x.y.z for branch labeled x.y.z)
   * =http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/cache/= is where the vtb cache is located
