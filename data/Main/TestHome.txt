---++ OSG News - July 2012

<b>Excerpt from the Press Release at the University of Wisconsin following the announcement of the discovery of a "Higgs like particle at the LHC".. </b>

When scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Europe announced the appearance of a new particle among the pieces of smashed protons, Miron Livny saw a huge scientific success. But the University of Wisconsin–Madison computer scientist reveled in more than a fascinating research finding. “It’s also a huge triumph for mankind,” says Livny, chief technology officer at the Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery. “There were more than 40 nations that came together for a long time to do this one thing that — even if it all worked out — wasn’t going to make anyone rich. It’s a powerful demonstration of the spirit of collaboration.” 

Collaboration has been guiding Livny’s work for decades, and it is a large part of UW–Madison’s contribution to the search for the Higgs boson. Whenever a physicist in the United States wants to sift the avalanche of data collected at the LHC, they tap Open Science Grid, a network of computing resources for which Livny serves as principal investigator. Open Science Grid services knit together researchers, many repositories of LHC data (UW–Madison is home to two research teams, one each for the two biggest experiments at LHC) and more than 100,000 computers at about 80 sites around the country.

 “The detectors at the LHC are really huge, high-tech cameras. Only they aren’t just looking at light. They’re capturing all sorts of energy,” says Dan Bradley, a University of Wisconsin–Madison software programmer working on LHC’s Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. “There is so much to keep track of at once that a lot of custom electronics had to be designed to catch it all.”

---++ OSG News - June 2012
<b>The OSG has been funded by DOE and NSF for another five years. From 2012 through 2016. We are very appreciative of the support and trust our sponsors are showing, and excited to be continuing with this unique partnership</b>

The goals of the "next five years" are expressed through the summary of the proposal text: Our unique partnership will continue to innovate and deliver a fabric of distributed high throughput computing (DHTC) services that advance the discovery capabilities of scientists, researchers and academics from a broad range of disciplines by transforming their computational throughput.

Working with faculty and students on campuses as well as large multi-national scientific collaborations we will continue to promote and facilitate the sharing of autonomous resources through mutual trust relationships where all the elements are optimized to maximize computational throughput.

Moving forward the OSG project will continue to contribute to DOE’s and NSF’s goals to serve science and research by building on the experience and knowhow of our skilled personnel and the capabilities of our widely adopted suite of services to transform the scientific computing landscape on our campuses.

The OSG will continue to work with the LHC communities to achieve the needed exabyte-per-year data movement and commensurate computational throughput within the timeframe of this proposal. These advances will form the basis for helping other communities to increase their computing throughput by one or more orders of magnitude–thus transforming their discovery ability and potential. A major thrust will be the wide deployment of intra-campus DHTC capabil-ities locally at the nation’s campuses–ensuring a strong base for future scientific competitiveness in the nation’s academic community and educating a new generation of computational scientists and professionals. The OSG will further extend its reach as a service provider to the NSF Ex-treme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project.
