---++GlueSubCluster Attributes

The !GlueSubCluster refers to homogeneous set of hosts as regards the selected attributes. This entity provides details of the machines that o&#64256;er execution environments to jobs.

 
dn: !GlueSubClusterUniqueID=CE_FQDN,GlueClusterUniqueID=CE_FQDN,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid 

Currently there is only one homogeneous sub-cluster defined. We will have to ask admins questions to get all subcluster input

*NOTES*:
   1. Currently there is only one homogeneous sub-cluster defined. 
   1. We will have to ask site administrators questions to correctly get most the !SubCluster attribues
