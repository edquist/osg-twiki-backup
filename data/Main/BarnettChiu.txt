The human really knows very little compared to the scale of the intelligence behind the universe(s). Why don't we open our minds to other areas that are not yet aligned with mainstream science? (more...)

I would like to help clarify a common misconception that people generally have toward Computer Science. First of all, software 
development and programming are NOT Computer Science. Programming is merely a tool for verifying and "materializing" 
ideas in CS, which is analogical to the role of Applied Mathematics in Physics... Computer Science is philosophy manifested in     
computational forms... (more to come)
