---+ Communications Prep work

---++ Info to glean from Katie in Dec
---+++ what are all the activities associated with communications

KY:
talk to rp, x-training. Team -- AH, JN, MT, MH, 
Try to work directly w Ruth

ky spent 30% time on OSG communic.
should be done: write strategic communication plan for OSG
Judy does one for each comm project, less about tactics more about what you want to accomplish
goal of comm plan. what should we accomplish it, what strategy to use, what tactics to do that strategy -- think about why to do anything

ky to send exampls of these plans
meet with JJ and Kurt, let them know what's going on with OSG communications, go to weekly meetings
all comm should go through Pub Affairs, say "this is coming up with osg..."
JJ doesn't know/care much about OSG, doesn't see OSG as crucial to future of lab (Ruth may assume JJ cares)

draft a plan, send to ruth, get feedback, send to exec board
miron has good sense of what nsf wants and can write well

   * Edit content for and publish the monthly OSG News e-newsletter.
      * how/where to find sources for content?
         * google news: cyberinfrastructure, grid computing, sign up for alerts
      * what can be considered for content?  New VOs, scientific results coming out of OSG, new s/w or middleware, increase in level of use, meetings, funding news, ???
      * process for finalizing content; who to approve, at what stage, etc.
      * technical details: program used, template, image requirements, fonts, etc.
   * Develop and produce talks, brochures, posters, exhibits and other OSG-related materials.
      * What didn't I learn about as we did the slide show and the brochure?
   * Generate and advise on public content for the OSG Web site.  
      * Who gives feedback?  
      * What are considerations?
   * Develop and design animations and video clips for the site.
      * This is what we're hiring out...

      * Do they ask for articles, or do you offer, or some of both?
      * Who are the contacts for each?
      * What are the processes for each?

   * How do you maintain your list of OSG internal contacts, eg. for VOs, sites, etc.

---++ Notes about various publications

   * once a month, roughly
   * meetings/events

   * spotlight on contributor (optional, depends on length of prev item) (~100-150 wds)
   * from the director (~200 wds)
   * research highlight (4-500 wds?)

What program used to create it? %BR%
How is archive page created/updated? %BR%
How to decide who or what to spotlight, highlight each month? %BR%
How to keep track of OSG "technical events" (new sites, new VOs, new papers, changes to middleware, new releases of OSG package)

Idea from Kent Blackburn: use the osg-contact list to have OSG members send in ideas for news articles

---+++ iSGTW
   * once a week

   * image of the week
   * statistic or link of the week
   * feature story
   * grids in the news

   * members are listed at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000095
   * these people are the Communicator's contacts for the various VOs, members and partners

Exec board
   * The Executive Director and Executive Board direct the OSG program of work, write policy and represent the OSG Consortium in relations with other organizations and committees.
