---+ OSG Summer School 2010 Recommendations
This describes Derek's observations and recommendations from the 2010 Summer School.

---++ Condor
Here I will agree with Brian, another day of Condor would be useful.  

I believe the lecture may have overwhelmed the students at first.  There was a lot of discussion of !ClassAds and matchmaking.  Although these are important characteristics of Condor, I believe they would have been better understood after running an example.  At one point, there is a slide with 7 boxes and 9 arrows showing how Condor runs a job.  I think this should be saved until after the first exercise,  to show what happened to their jobs.

We talked about Condor's standard universe, but it cannot be used on the grid.  It might be possible to use standard universe with glideins, but it hasn't been tested.

---++ Condor-G, Matchmaker, Glidein


---++ Storage
This is a week area in the OSG.  At ISSGC09, we described how to use glite's LFN.  I believe this area was covered with the appropriate level of detail.

The documents that were written for the grid school will be incorporated into the user documentation.

---++ Science into HTC


---++ Conclusion
The interaction between the student and instructors during down time was much lower than in my trip to ISSGC09.  I would have liked if the instructors and students shared more dinners together.
