---+ OSG Summer School 2010 Recommendations
This describes Derek's observations and recommendations from the 2010 Summer School.

---++ Condor
Here I will agree with Brian, another day of Condor would be useful.  

I believe the lecture may have overwhelmed the students at first.  There was a lot of discussion of ClassAds and matchmaking.  Although these are important characteristics of Condor, I believe they would have been better understood after running an example.  At one point, there is a slide with 7 boxes and 9 arrows showing how Condor runs a job.  Since this school is about the grid, most of these boxes will not be used.

---++ Condor-G, Matchmaker, Glidein


---++ Storage


---++ Science into HTC


---++ Conclusion
