---+!! %SPACEOUT{ "%TOPIC%" }%
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

Lists the tools in the Main web that we have developed for our own use across pages.
 

%STARTSECTION{ "BottomMatter" }%
---++ Set long references with =<nop>%BOTTOMMATTER<nop>%=

=BOTTOMMATTER= shows several things:
   * Links to "where used" references to show where this topic is included in another topic
   * Links to children topics of this topic

To use the combined bottom matter, you don't have to include the ToolsBottomMatter. We have made a TWiki-wide variable.

---+++ Usage
=<nop>%BOTTOMMATTER<nop>%= is usually placed at the bottom of the page. It includes a HR (horizontal rule) line so that  all you have to do is include this after your text.

   $ *%RED% IMPORTANT %ENDCOLOR%*: Put this variable _beneath_ your =STOPINCLUDE= tag!

<pre>
   <nop>%BOTTOMMATTER<nop>%
</pre>
---+++ Example
%BOTTOMMATTER%

%ENDSECTION{ "BottomMatter" }%




%STARTSECTION{ "WhereUsed" }%
---++ Show "where used" references with =<nop>WHU<nop>%=

The "where used" topic allows you to show where this topic appears in other topics. Use this variable rather than =BOTTOMMATTER= to show only links to topics that INCLUDE this topic.

---+++ Usage
<nop>%WHU<nop>% is usually placed at the bottom of the page. 

    $ *%RED% IMPORTANT %ENDCOLOR%*: Put this variable _beneath_ your =STOPINCLUDE= tag!

<pre>
   <nop>%WHU<nop>%
</pre>

---+++ Example
%WHU%

%STOPSECTION{ "WhereUsed" }%



%STARTSECTION{ "ShowChildren" }%
---++ Show children of the current topic with =<nop>%SHOWCHILDREN<nop>%=

---+++ Usage
=<nop>%SHOWCHILDREN<nop>%= is usually placed at the bottom of the page. 

    $ *%RED% IMPORTANT %ENDCOLOR%*: Put this variable _beneath_ your =STOPINCLUDE= tag!

<pre>
   <nop>%SHOWCHILDREN<nop>%
</pre>

---+++ Example
%SHOWCHILDREN%

%ENDSECTION{ "ShowChildren" }%



%STARTSECTION{ "EditThis" }%
---++ Show an *EditThis* button for easy editing of INCLUDEd topics

The =<nop>%EDITTHIS<nop>%= and =<nop>%EDITTHISSECTION<nop>%= variables let you edit an included topic from the main topic with a click of the mouse. No more mucking around in the raw TWiki of the main topic, trying to find the right INCLUDE tag!

---++ Usage
Place the =EDITTHIS= variables at the top of your topic, right below the =<nop>%STARTINCLUDE<nop>%= or =<nop>%STARTSECTION<nop>%= tags.

   $ *%RED% NOTE %ENDCOLOR%*: We recommend that you use the =EDITTHIS= variable to place an button image onto the page. The =EDITTHISSSECTION= text link is less obtrusive but will print to the PDF. The button will not. However, we provide both.

<pre>
   <nop>%STARTINCLUDE<nop>%
   <nop>%EDITTHIS<nop>%
   <EM>[EMPTY LINE!]</EM>
</pre>

---++ Example
%EDITTHIS%

%ENDSECTION{ "EditThis" }%
