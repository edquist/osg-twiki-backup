---++Introduction

Here are some *tips/comments* for setting up a grid node as per instructions in the OSG Install Guide. When I started this project, I had very, very limited knowledge about system adminstration, so these comments maybe useful for novices (like me). Feel free to e-mail me.

---++ Installing the cluster

---+++ Setting up the ROCKS cluster

We used ROCKS 3.3 [[http://www.rocksclusters.org/Rocks/ ROCKS]] to setup the cluster; the installation documentation is very well written.
Since we were setting up a test grid node, we used some old CPU's which were lying around. I mention this because, we ended up booting the compute nodes using a floppy disk (the CD drives were not working and the NIC cards were too old to know about a PXE boot). We downloaded the relevant software from [[http://www.rom-o-matic.net/ here]] - you have to know the type of your NIC.

The ROCKS headnode is multi-homed. One NIC is connected to the external world and the other to the internal network. The latter has the IP address - 10.1.1.1. We have three compute nodes. When we go to a bigger cluster, we will probably have to do more sophisticated things for setting up NFS.

---+++ OSG-GateKeeper

Here we took a box and installed Scientific Linux 3 on it. Initially, we had connected this only to the external world, but it was recommended by [[Main.TerrenceMartin][Terrence]] that we also connect it to the same private network as the ROCKS headnode; the GK's internal card is connected on the "same side" of the switch as the ROCKS compute nodes. 

The internal NIC had a IP address of 10.1.1.2. For the DNS address, we used 10.1.1.1, i.e., the ROCKS headnode. It is necessary to have the GK talk directly to the compute nodes - makes the operation of CONDOR more robust. I will talk more about this later on the document.

Now come my comments/tips on the install guide - [[Integration.OSGCEInstallGuide]]
