Each person in your team will now request a certificate from the DOEGrids certificate authority.

Here's the long command-line to type. You must modify some of the parameters. Make sure you do this before submitting the request.

<pre class="screen">
$ <userinput>cert-request -agree -ou p -name "Your Name Here" -email youremail@somewhere.edu  \
    -phone "+111-111-1111" -reason "Grid school" -affiliation osg -vo osgedu -label YOURNAME   \
    -sponsor_name "Mike Wilde"</userinput>
</pre>

You will need to change  -name, -email, -phone and -label.

You will be asked for a secret passphrase. Choose one. Do not forget this passphrase - it cannot be reset by the course administrators.

When you have submitted your request, the other person in your team should request a certificate using a similar command. Make sure to change -name -email -phone and -label so that you do not overwrite each other's credentials.
