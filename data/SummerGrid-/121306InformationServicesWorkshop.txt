---++ Information Services Workshops 
This activity involves visits to the NorduGrid Distributed Facility groups by OSG researchers to work on the next phase of interoperability of Information Services to ensure transparent access across the two infrastructures for data movement and job scheduling. 

---+++ University of South Florida Activities
Anda will have small CS projects that could be assigned as class project to graduate students. She is teaching a Federated Distributed Systems class
in Fall that has a project component and might lead to some interesting results.
 Termed as ?Glue Schema V1.3? one of the goals is to bring the existing NorduGrid (NGDF)  information structure to be compatible with OSG. This activity involves a broader set of grid projects, as the need for global interoperation of infrastructures is key for the scientific collaborations we are serving both in the US and in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Sweden. 
Anda and her student, Lydia Prieto, are planning to install use the VDT
software stack and do a real implementation in order to test and validate
our ideas. 

Anda will attend the technical workshop on Information and Service Discovery for Open Science Grid and NorduGrid Distributed Facility

The USF deliverables after workshop:
Plan of research to be conducted at USF as part of the collaboration and related to the problems discussed during the workshop and other related meetings during this trip.

Our related research interests:
   * Grid resource management
   * Resource description and discovery across grids
   * Standards for interoperability in grid middleware systems

---+++ University of Iowa  Activities

We are gaining understanding about how to set up ARC and setting up
an OSG/VDT distribution for NorduGrid. We will compare the similarity
and difference, especially on information services aspect between ARC
and OSG/VDT. We will also try to get Hello World jobs to flow between
NorduGrid and OSG.
