---++ Welcome!
<img src="http://conferences.fnal.gov/interlab2006/images/Gridworkshop1.jpg" style="float:right; width:308px; height:231px;">Welcome to the web site of the 2007 Rio Grande Grid School. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][The Open Science grid]] (OSG), the [[http://www.teragrid.org][TeraGrid]] together with the Department of Computer Science at the [[http://www.utb.edu][University of Texas at Brownsville]], the [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu][Computation Institute]] of [[http://www.uchicago.edu][The University of Chicago]] present a two-and-a-half day weekend workshop program in grid computing and its application to scientific data analysis.

<br style="clear:both;">

---++ Aim and Purpose
The aim of the workshop is to give the students a basic foundation in distributed computing, and valuable hands-on training in computing techniques. The workshop introduces essential skills that will be needed by students in the natural and applied sciences, engineering, and computer science to conduct and support scientific analysis in the emerging grid computing environment.

Participants will work with leading experts in grid computing, through a blend of lectures, discussions and hands-on computing exercises on large-scale grid hardware and software resources.

---++ Location

The workshop will be held Friday-Sunday March 24-25 at the [[http://www.uic.edu/depts/chcc/sce.html][Student Center East (SCE)]] of the [[http://www.uic.edu][University of Illinois at Chicago]], adjacent to downtown Chicago Illinois.

Registration will take place in SCE-605, and the workshop will be held in room 401. These are both in the SCE Tower, at the North end of the Student Center. If you enter SCE from the main entrance on Halsted, follow the signs up the escalator, north to the elevator, and then to the 6th and 4th floors.
