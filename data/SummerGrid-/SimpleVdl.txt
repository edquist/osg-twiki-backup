---+!! Simple VDL
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

In this exercise, you will write your own VDL to run one step in the QuarkNet? problem code, which takes the processed data and generates a graph.

You are provided with:
   * the input data files for this step, =simplevdl-extra= and =simplevdl-freqs=. (These are the same as some of the intermediate files that were generated in your =PROBINTRO/= directory). These have already been registered with the replica location system (which you will see in greater depth in a later exercise);
   * a transformation definition that defines how to use =Plot.pl= from the =<nop>QuarkCode/= directory to convert input data files into a graph, in =transform.vdl=;
   * a template file =simple.vdl.template= for the derivation.

Armed with these tools, you will need to write a derivation which uses the supplied transformation on the supplied data files to produce the output graph.

Copy the =SIMPLEVDL/= directory into your workspace, and use the supplied template to make a =simple.vdl= file:

<pre class="screen">
$ <span class="in">cp -av /opt/vdltut/SIMPLEVDL ~</span>

$ <span class="in">cd ~/SIMPLEVDL/</span>
$ <span class="in">cp simple.vdl.template simple.vdl</span>
$ <span class="in">vi simple.vdl </span>
</pre>

%NOTE% Or use any text editor you choose.

In the last step using vi, modify the derivation so that =@USER@= is replaced with =trainXX= in all three places that it occurs.

Now try compiling, planning and running your workflow:

<pre class="screen">
$ <span class="in">vdlc simple.vdl transform.vdl</span>
<span class="out">20060609T152414.181: [app] using label "simple"
20060609T152414.182: [app] using output file "simple.dax"
$</span> <span class="in">vds-plan --pegasus -g QuarkCode --option pools=local --option output=local --option force simple.dax --base ./dags</span>
[...]
<span class="out">2006.06.09 19:18:14.059 PDT: [INFO] Time taken to execute is 1.029 seconds

I have concretized your abstract workflow. The workflow has been entered
into the workflow database with a state of "planned". The next step is 
to start or execute your workflow. The invocation required is

vds-run  /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017</span>

$ <span class="in">vds-run /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017</span>
[...]
<span class="out">I have started your workflow, committed it to DAGMan, and updated its
state in the work database. A separate daemon was started to collect
information about the progress of the workflow. The job state will soon
be visible. Your workflow runs in base directory

cd /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017</span>

$ <span class="in">cd /home/train99/SIMPLEVDL/dags/QuarkCode/simple/run0017</span>
$ <span class="in">tail -f tailstatd.log</span>
[... output over time ...]
