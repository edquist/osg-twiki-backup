This works only with Mac OS 10.3 and above. You must have already obtained your certificate using, e.g., Netscape: you can't request and retrieve a cert using either Safari or Internet Explorer on the Mac. The following only works if the e-mail address that you send e-mail with is the same as the e-mail address associated with your cert. Capitalization is important.

Add your cert to your keychain by double-clicking on the cert you just saved to disk. Keychain should open and you will be asked Do you want to add certificate(s) from the file .... If offered a drop-down menu, select the Keychain whose name is your (mac) username or select login. You will need to enter the password you used to encode the certificates when you saved them to disk in the last step.
</LI>

<LI>
Allow the Mail.app access to your private key. Click on the private key you just added in Keychain and select the Access Control tab. Under Always allow access by these applications click Add and the browse to the Mail application. Add it to the list.
</LI>

<LI>
Get the DOEGrids CA and ESNet CA certs. Using Safari go to http://www.doegrids.org/pages/Fingerprints.htm and download the PEM encoded ESnet Root CA 1 Certificate by option-clicking on the link. You should get a file named d1b603c3.0. Move it to the desktop if it is not already there. Download the PEM encoded DOEGrids Root CA 1 Certificate by option-clicking on the link. You should get a file named 1c3f2ca8.0. Move it to the desktop if it is not already there.
</LI>

<LI>
Modify your system X509Anchors. In this step you will inform your system that it should trust the CA that signed your certs. Make a copy of your system X509Anchors:<br>


<CODE>sudo cp /System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors /System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors.orig
</CODE><p>
      Add the ESNet cert to X509Anchors:<br>

<CODE>sudo certtool i ~/Desktop/d1b603c3.0 v k=/System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors
</CODE><p>
<CODE>sudo certtool i ~/Desktop/1c3f2ca8.0 v k=/System/Library/Keychains/X509Anchors
</CODE><br><br>
      You should get, in both cases, the message ...certificate successfully imported.
<P>
You're done! (Re)Start mail. Open a compose window. You should see, in thearea on the far right just below the subject text box, an icon that looks like a 10 pointed star. It is clickable. If depressed then your message will besigned with your cert; if not, it will not be signed.
</P>

<P>
When you receive a signed e-mail, the mac mail app should recognize the signature as valid because it knows to trust the DOEGrids CA.
</P>

When you are sending mail to someone whose cert is in your keychain, you will have a second clickable box next to the signature star. That box will looklike a padlock. If you click on it, then the message you send will be encrypted to them.
