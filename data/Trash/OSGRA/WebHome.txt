<h2>OSG Registration Authority</h2><p>
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
The OSG RA operates as part of the <a href="http://www.doegrids.org/" target="_new">DOEGrids PKI</a> for the purpose of providing X509 grid certificates for people and services participating with the Open Science Grid, starting July 2006. The policies governing the DOEGrids PKI and the OSG RA are defined in the DOEGrids CP/CPS at <a href="http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf" target="_new">http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf</a> that describes the responsibilities of subscribers (people getting certificates), relying parties (sites & people that will accept usage of the certificates) in addition to the CA and RA staff.
The certificates issued by the PPDG and iVDGL Registration Authorities as well as people working with those RA's in the roles of Agents, !GridAdmins, and Sponsors are all transitioned to the OSG RA. The PPDG and iVDGL RA's will be phased out by the end of 2006 (or sooner).
<p>
 

<h2>Requesting Certificates</h2><p>
Following the OSG support model, OSG users who need certificates should receive instructions from their VO or Support Center. Click <a href="http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?datasource=summary&all_vos=on&active_value=1">here</a> for a list of OSG Support Centers. The generalized instructions for requesting, retrieving, exporting, and using DOE certificates in OSG is outlined in the links to the left.
Those people already familiar with the procedures can go directly to the <a href="https://pki1.doegrids.org/" target="_new">Certificate Service Web</a> site, or use the command-line [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertScriptsPackage][script interface]] available in VDT and OSG software installations.
