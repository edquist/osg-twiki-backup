---+++ General requirements for attendees
   * All attendees should have laptops (wireless Internet access will be available).
   * They should have a valid grid certificate for the OSG and have it loaded into their web browsers. Information about certificates and how to obtain them is available [[Documentation.GetAccessToGrid][here]].
   * Install-fest attendees should have the necessary server(s) and host, and service certificates.
   * Specific session requirements are listed in the session descriptions below and in the hands-on guides.

Each of the following sections corresponds to a session of the workshop and includes: an introduction about the topics covered, requirements for people planning to attend the session at the August meeting, some links suggested by the session organizers, links to one or more hands-on guides.
Note that requirements for attendees are repeated and better stated within the hands-on guides.


---++ OSG 1.2 
This session is not a tutorial. It will present an Open Science Grid overview for experienced users (what is new in OSG 1.2/VDT 2) and introduce to newcomers: its architecture, the available documentation.
It will then introduce briefly all the tutorials of the workshop.

---++ GUMS and Computing Element installation - !InstallFest 1
*GUMS installation: Standalone and in an High Availability setting. (Steve Timm)*
The first part of the GUMS installation will show how to install a single GUMS
server using the normal OSG Release Documentation.  We will also cover simple administration
tasks of GUMS such as adding a new group.  We will then show how to replicate
the high-availability GUMS setup at Fermilab.  Draft tutorial information is at 
[[http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgf684mf_2fb5kmnd4&hl=en][Google Docs]] but some of it still needs
to be updated for GUMS 1.3.x.
   * GUMSHandsOn
   * HighAvailabilityHandsOn

*CE Installation* walk through, then one on one tutoring/problem solving.
   * ComputingElementHandOn

*Requirements*
Attendees should have the necessary server/s and possibly have already server/service certificates.
GUMS and CE installation will require one server each (it can be the same if you are just testing) with a platform [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]] and you will need admin (root) privileges.
The installation of High availability GUMS server will require a machine to host two VMWare virtual machines.<br>
If any, the cluster (queue manager, worker nodes) behind your CE must be up, running and connected to the internet.<br>
You can write to [[mailto:osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org][OSG-Sites mailing list]] if you have specific questions about your configuration and requirements.
If you are updating an existing installation, a backup of the existing installation is recommended.

---++ Security best practices
Security best practices.
Unix security best practices, OSG processes and expectations
   * Policies
   * Expectations & Assumptions
   * Useful Tools & Practices
   * Examples

---++ Network performance and troubleshooting
Hands-on troubleshooting using the client tools - In this session attendees would have to use the clients included in VDT or boot their laptop using the Knoppix ISO.  This would give them access to the client tools.  Rich would run a server on his laptop and can create network faults that the attendees would find.  

If time allows some tips on configuring the !perfSONAR server will be provided.

*Hands-on guides:*
   * NetworkPerformanceHandsOn

*Requirements.*
This session will require a network switch in the meeting room with access to the Internet for NTP & DHCP.
Attendees will need a laptop with OSG-Client installed. If this is not possible (e.g. Windows machines) they could boot the laptop using the Knoppix live CD provided including the client tools.

---++Storage Element Installation - !InstallFest 2
Installation tips and help, one on one tutoring and problem solving. SRM (what is, different options in VDT dCache and various !BeStMans), Support for different FS in !BeStMan(xrootd, Hadoop, NFS or other POSIX like)

*Hands-on guides:*
   * 
*Requirements*
Attendees should have the necessary server/s and possibly have already server/service certificates.
Servers must be a platform [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]] and you will need admin (root) privileges.
All installations are possible on a single server, but multiple servers are recommended for bigger and more performant installations, e.g. for use in bigger production sites. See the recommended references for more information.<br>
The advance reading of the referenced document describing your SE of choice is recommended.

You can write to osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org if you have specific questions about your configuration and requirements.<br>
If you are updating an existing installation, a backup of the existing installation is recommended.

---++ Virtual Machines
   * Hands-on session demonstrating the use of a Nimbus Cloud and deploying OSG services in a Cloud: VirtualMachinesHandsOn
   * Discussion about spinning up user software inside cloud images and the security implications of cloud computing

*Requirements*
Participants should have a grid certificate and contact ayounts@purdue.edu in advance so there are enough resources available during the session.

---++ Monitoring
   * Hands-on session explaining how administrators can use [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu][MyOSG]] to their advantage to monitor status, debug, look for accounting data, etc. 
   * Information on ensuring clean topology information in OIM -- lot of other services depend on OIM data, and can produce misleading results if OIM has bad data
   * How to convert existing scripts into an RSV probe; how to plug it into an existing RSV setup?
   * How to upload RSV results from a site level RSV client to a Nagios server.
   * Other possible topics ... 

---++Others
Hands-on guides that will not be presented during the workshop sessions:
   * Personal client installation: ClientInstallationHandsOn
