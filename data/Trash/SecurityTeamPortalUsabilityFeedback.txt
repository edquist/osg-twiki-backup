---+ Usability Feedback on the OSG Certificate Registration Page

Here is a summary of some feedback from various VOs on
the [[https://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/certreg.php][new certificate registration page]].

---++ Its Good Features

1. Was generally liked by VOs. Some wrote enthusiastically
   about it.

2. Has clear descriptions, a good lay-out, and is easier
   for OSG end users than the main current alternative.

3. The pre-filled-out sponsor information is really useful.

4. Most of the VOs we heard from are planning to recommend it to their
   users, with mainly the exception of a few who use KCA certificates
   or were unaware of it.


---++ Suggestions for Changes or Additions

1. The page ideally should not ask for a user certificate since the
   page is supposed to be supplying a certificate.

   _But it's been reported that this doesn't happen when there's no certificate in the browser, as would probably be the case with a new user. The http (as opposed to the https) version of the page is also ok._

2. The page has a tinyurl.com link. It would be a little better to
   have the real URL to allow users to see what they're clicking.

3. It may be useful to have a longer discussion about the trade-offs
   between different key lengths. Or maybe only allow 2048 bit keys.

4. Maybe the page could automatically register the user with the
   indicated VO so there is no separate VO registration process.

5. Could have a web form for agents to change the list of sponsors.


Thank you to the VOs who helped with this.
