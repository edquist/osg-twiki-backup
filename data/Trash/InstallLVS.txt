---+ Installing and Maintaining a Linux Virtual Server [DRAFT]

%TOC{depth="3"}%

---++ About This Guide

[[http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/whatis.html][Linux Virtual Server]] (LVS) is a technology that performs IP load balancing for a cluster of _real servers_. LVS is implemented through the IP Virtual Server ([[http://kb.linuxvirtualserver.org/wiki/IPVS][IPVS]]) kernel module that can be managed through userspace applications that offer features such as real server health monitoring and high-availability. This guide will cover how to install, configure, run, test, and troubleshoot the [[http://www.keepalived.org/index.html][keepalived]] service on an LVS host for a set of !GridFTP hosts.
