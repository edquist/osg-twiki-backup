---++ What is Pacman?

Pacman is a tool to install software. Conceptually you can think of it as being like &ldquo;yum&rdquo;, if you are familiar with that tool. Pacman looks at web-accessible descriptions of packages in [[SoftwareCaches][software caches]] and installs the software that is needed. You can ask for individual software packages to be installed or sets of packages. 

---++ In this release
%OSG_RELEASE% %VERSION% uses Pacman %PACMAN_VERSION%.  See PacmanInstall for installation instructions.


---++ When do we use Pacman?
We use Pacman for all OSG installations except for dCache. 

---++ When don't we use Pacman?
We do not use Pacman for the VDT dCache installation (see further [[DCache]]).
