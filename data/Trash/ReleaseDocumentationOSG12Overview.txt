---+ OSG 1.2 Release Overview

---++ Contents

%TOC%

---++ Introduction
The OSG 1.2 release has been released on July 24, 2009.  This release has several changes that will allow sites to update to new version more easily as well as changes to make administering and running an OSG site easier.  

---++ VDT Changes
This release is based on the VDT 2.0.0 release.  Major changes in the VDT distribution since the 1.10.1 release include:
   * Support for Debian 5 (x86 and x86-64)
   * Mysql 4 has been removed
   * There has been a change in how ca-certs are managed
   * %RED%pacman 3.28 is now required to install%ENDCOLOR%
   * Services are now disabled by default on installation
   * RSV has been updated to RSV 3 which features new probes

For a complete list of changes and more details, please look at the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release.html][vdt 2.0.0 release notes]]. 

---++ OSG Changes
One of the largest changes is a change in the directory structure for osg files.  There is only an osg directory in the CE installation that contains osg related binaries (in =osg/bin=) and configuration (in =osg/etc=).  In addition, the =osg/bin= directory is now put in =$PATH= when setup.sh is sourced.  The old =monitoring= directory is now a symlink to =osg/etc= for backward compatibility.  Other changes present in this release include a new version of rsv. 

There have also been changes to configure_osg.py .  The command is now called =configure-osg= and is present in the =PATH= if setup.sh has been sourced.  =configure-osg= now uses =osg/etc/config.ini= for it's settings and there is no option to use any other file for configuration information.  Also any time it is run successfully, the configuration is saved in =osg/etc/configs= with a time stamp in the file name. =osg/etc/configs/current-config.ini= will point to the last configuration that was used to setup the ce installation.  

The extract functionality of =configure-osg= has also been removed and moved to a command called =extract-config=.  This command will try to get the information from a previous install as specified by the =OLD_VDT_LOCATION= and write an updated ini file called =extracted-config.ini= in the current directory.  If the old installation was using a config.ini file with the old gip format, it will try to rewrite that to the new format with separate subcluster and se sections in the =extracted-config.ini= file.  Although this process is mostly automated, you will need to change some settings due to additional settings that have been added to config.ini

Other changes present include
   * osg-version command which accepts a =--verbose= option which also gives the VDT version and patch level current installed (e.g. =OSG 1.1.6 (VDT 2.0.0p6)=)
   

---++ Installing / Updating
This release of OSG is now located in a different cache so that sites have the choice of use the OSG 1.0.x or 1.2.x releases.  The new cache location is  %CACHE%.  In order to install, the OSG 1.2 release you must use the url instead of the =OSG= symbol.  E.g. to install the ce package, you would use =pacman -get %CACHE%:ce=.

There are installation guides for installing the various components available at the [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][release documentation web]].  In addition, for experienced admins, there is a [[ReleaseDocumentation.QuickInstallGuide][streamlined installation guide]] available as well.


---++ Getting help

If you run into problems during installation or afterwards, you can use the osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org mailing list to get answers to your questions from other admins and other sites on OSG.  You can also use the campfire site available at http://integrationcloud.campfirenow.com/6e62e on Tuesdays through Fridays between 11am Central and 2pm Central.
