%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++ Introduction
Brief description of function of software and how it fits into the overall system.

---+++!! Applicable Versions
The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version x.y* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  a.b*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
Include a link to document containing engineering information.
E.g. Needs to be installed on its own server, can be combined with some other service, need to have multiple servers depending on site size, etc.
This can be in-line if it is fairly short -- a couple of paragraphs.

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].
%BR%
If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following this ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure.

---++ Checklist
An in-line numbered list of items assumed to have been already performed
E.g.:
   1. Installs that must be done before this one
   1. Security environment in place
   1. batch system in place
   1. stop existing service
   1. ports required

---++ First Time Install
A link to document containing information and install steps that only need to be performed if this a first time install.

---++ Installation Procedure
The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using 
<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Description of the steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
This often requires, the reader to edit lines in a config file.
If this is necessary, put the lines in a screen box with a yellow background 
(to distinguish from entering commands (green box).
<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

LCG Utils can be installed from the VDT software distribution via the pacman command

<verbatim>
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_<version>_cache:LCG-Utils
</verbatim>

where <version> stands for the version number of the VDT distribution. Choose the "install locally" option for the CA certificates to avoid conflict with existing GSI infrastructure.

After running ". setup.sh", basic commands can be executed as follows. For a copy command, after creating a user proxy, run
<verbatim>
lcg-cp -v -b -D srmv2 file:/testdata/test1 <SRM URL>
</verbatim>

Here the SRM URL is to an SRM v2.2 web service endpoint. Copies between storage elements are also allowed.

To delete a file, use the VO from the proxy and execute
<verbatim>
lcg-del -b -v -l --vo <VO> -D srmv2 <SRM URL>
</verbatim>

A [[%ATTACHURL%/test_lcg_utils_vdt.sh][lcg-utils test script]] may be used. The script writes to a SRM v2.2 storage element, obtains TURLS for the written files, and deletes the. Change the definitions at the beginning of the script to match your site and VO.

Further documentation for LCG-Utils may be found the the [[https://edms.cern.ch/file/454439//LCG-2-UserGuide.html#SECTION00097000000000000000][LCG User Guide]]. Note that the requirement of setting LCG_GFAL_INFOSYS applies only when using a BDII server.


---++ Validation of Service Operation
Commands to be used to verify the service is working correctly.  This can be combined with the previous section if they are both short.

#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Information
---+++!!File Locations
Locations of configuration files, input/output files, log files, etc. that are important for an administrator to know about if something doesn't work.  

---+++!!Debugging Procedure
What are the first things to check, step-by-step instructions to determine source of problem for this service

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues 

---+++!!References
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants more background or information.
