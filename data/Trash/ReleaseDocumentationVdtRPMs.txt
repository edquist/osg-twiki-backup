---++ VDT Software provided as RPMs

Most VDT software is only provided via Pacman. There are three exceptions to this:

   1. The VDT dCache installation is provided only via RPMs.
   1. The Globus software can be optionally downloaded as RPMs. This is only the raw bits: none of the VDT scripts for configuration are included. It will probably not be useful to most people, but is used by [[http://www.eu-egee.org/][EGEE]]. Minimal [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installing-rpms.html][documentation on VDT RPMs]] is available from the VDT web site.  %RED% Note that some of the links are broken on this URL and there are no actual RPMS available for any VDT 1.9 or 1.10 release as yet. VDT support notified with ticket.  SCT %ENDCOLOR%
   1. There is an RPM available for the public certificates of the Certificate Authorities distributed by the VDT. It can be downloaded and installed manually or you can use YUM. See [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/certificate_authorities.html][documentation from the VDT web site about installing CA certificates via YUM and RPM]]. However, the OSG installation does not use this RPM by default: you're on your own if you want to figure out how to do this.  Also note that this rpm won't help you if you need to have Certificate Revocation Lists as well (CRL's) which most servers such as the CE do.
