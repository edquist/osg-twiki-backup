---++ Production Assessment Analysis
   * Production is dynamic - hard to pin down what to monitor
   * How do the real time aspect into a metric (e.g. responsiveness to compatibility issue with GUMS)
   * Projects/services run by Production
      * HTPC
      * Campus Grids (what are the metrics?)
         * Number of campuses that have deployed (or in production)
         * How available are these? - probe sites to find what is available at each site?
         * Number users of campus grids (good metric but tougher to measure)
         * Current status: Other than Nebraska, very little production use
      * Stakeholder requests (capture some real time aspect?)
   * Production Statistics
      * WLCG metrics (resource provided, reliability, availability)
      * Other VOs typically do not have their needs/goals as well specified so it is more difficult to create a metric and know what is good
      * Opportunistic availability (really tough)  - probe sites to find what is available at each site?
      * Opportunistic use
      * Others?
