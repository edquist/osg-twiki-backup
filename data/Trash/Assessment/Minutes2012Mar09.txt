---++ Focus on campus assessment - discussion
   * http://mwt2.wufoo.com/forms/survey-for-campus-grid-users/
   * Here is an example survey we preformed for UC Tier3 users, http://mwt2.wufoo.com/reports/uc-tier3-summary/
   * Brookline: GLOW - used Engage survey as a starting point.  Next time: would want papers, citations, grant opportunities.   We also ask our internal team about each of our engagements; they were pretty much aligned.
   * Alain: not an expert - how do we ask the right questions. 
   * Brookline: it is a science, there are professionals which craft these, remove biases, etc.  Maybe poke around on campus - have someone third party. 
   * Gabriele: what is the angle?  What do you want from the data?
   * Chander: seems there are two stages: communications to a broad community that we want to engage, availability of technology, evangelizing.  Second is how useful is it for those places where we made the delivery.
   * Chander: do we want to advertise this through Campus Champions (XSEDE channel)
   * Brookline: surveys are a great tool - but we need to know which are the main.  
   * Brookline: must understand the target audience, make questions appropriate.  July 1 - June 30.
