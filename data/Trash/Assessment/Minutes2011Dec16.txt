---++ Operations Trash/Trash/Assessment Analysis
   * OpsAssessmentDefined
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/OpsAssessment121411.xls][Operations balanced scorecard]]  - track development here: https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/ASSESSMENT-1
   * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10240][Operations Trash/Trash/Assessment Jira dashboard]] - track development here: http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/ASSESSMENT-3
   * Metrics were chosen on the basis of value and availability.  Going over OpsAssessmentDefined.
   * Open vs Closed: is it growing greater than one?  New trend? Want this to be 1.
   * SLA exceptions should be 0 as target.  Express as limit.
   * Number of after hours requests is a measure of community understanding of operations policy
   * Reliability, availability of infrastructure services - many of these have SLAs.  The numbers are meant to guide internal performance.  
   * From the defined metrics, there is nothing that measures "customer satisfaction".  Need to create a survey for this. 
   * Alain: need interpretation for some of the operational metric risk factors. 
   * Worried about how the BSC is interpreted.  "Lots of yellow" - how will the ET will respond. Cannot repeat long interpretive discussions.  Need to demonstrate we've thought critically, and synthesize. *No new technologies*.
   * Alain: does this reflect worries, or where problems actually are.
   * Note linkages to recent strategic accomplishments document - hope to be revised. 

---++ Discussion 
   * Want Operations dashboard to link up with Jira dashboard
   * Jim and Rob G will discuss offline - interpretation

---++ AOB
   * Next meeting is production - owned by Dan.
