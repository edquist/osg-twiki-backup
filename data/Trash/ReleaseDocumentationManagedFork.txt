---++The Managed Fork Queue
<div class="twikiSmall" style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;"><a href="%SCRIPTURLPATH%/edit%SCRIPTSUFFIX%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%">Edit this section</a></div>

With OSG 0.4.1 an optional service called the Managed Fork has been introduced. This service replaces
the default jobmanager fork with a jobmanager which uses Condor to manage the incoming jobmanager fork requests.

<font color=blue>Please note that the managed fork will only work in Condor 6.7.15 or greater; older versions of Condor will run all local universe jobs as soon as they are submitted or may result in an error.</font>

The standard fork jobmanager is used to spawn jobs on the gatekeeper/headnode, the Managed Fork updates the fork jobmanager to submit requests to the local universe Condor queue instead. These jobs are still run on the gatekeeper/headnode, but the jobs may now be subject to limitations and
priority as assigned by the local system administrator.
 

By using the "local universe" fork jobs are not actually subject to scheduling delays, unless the total number of allowed fork jobs of a given type is exceeded.


---+++Managed Fork Package Installation

The installation is done in same directory as the OSG CE software.
To specify an external Condor installation set the
following two environment variables before installing:
d39 4
<ul>

  <li><code><b>VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION</b></code>: the location of
      your Condor installation (e.g. <code>/opt/condor</code>). The Condor
      <code>bin/</code>,
      <code>sbin/</code>, <code>etc/</code>, <code>lib/</code>...  directories should be
      directly under this location.

  <li><code><b>VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG</b></code> (optional): The location of your
      Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is
      <code>${VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION}/etc/condor_config</code>.


</ul>
d41 3
 Otherwise a full Condor installation will be installed with the package.

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>pacman -get ITB:ManagedFork</b>
&gt; cd $VDT_LOCATION
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt; pacman -get ITB:ManagedFork
<pre>
  &gt; cd $VDT_LOCATION
  &gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
  &gt; pacman -get ITB:ManagedFork
</pre>
To configure the default jobmanager to be the managed fork jobmanager, execute the
following command.
d87 4
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork y
To configure the default jobmanager to be the managed fork jobmanager, execute the following command.
<pre>
By default, the managed fork jobmanager will behave just like the fork jobmanager.  
If you wish to restrict it, you need to modify your local Condor configuration.  
If you're using Condor from the VDT this can be done by editing 
<i>$VDT_LOCATION/condor/local.&lt;hostname&gt;/condor_config.local</i>. 
  &gt; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork y --server y
<p>Only allow 20 local universe jobs to execute concurrently: 

START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20

Only allow 20 local universe jobs to execute concurrently: 
START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20 || GridMonitorJob == TRUE
d64 1
<pre>
   START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20
START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20 || GridMonitorJob =?= TRUE
</pre>

Set a hard limit on most jobs, but always let grid monitor jobs run (strongly recommended):
<pre>
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh= <br>
&gt; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork n
<pre>

=source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh=
=$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork n=
