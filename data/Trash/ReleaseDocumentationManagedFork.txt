---++ Introduction to Managed Fork

Managed Fork is an optional service which  replaces the default fork jobmanager with Condor to manage incoming fork requests.  Commands such as =condor_q= and =condor_history= can be used to see the actual command lines of the fork jobs during and after execution, providing an important logging capacity.  More importantly, the number of fork jobs can be controlled with a configurable policy to help ensure that the CE is not overwhelmed by fork jobs.  This is a very important consideration: the standard fork manager allows a user to accidentally or maliciously "fork bomb" a CE.  As such, Managed Fork is highly recommended.

%IMPORTANT% The Managed Fork job manager does not schedule fork jobs onto compute nodes in the execution pool. Using a Condor local universe, the jobs are still scheduled to the CE headnode, but since the local universe is used they should run quickly and without delay unless a scheduling limit for the CE has been reached. 

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Define Managed Fork in the Glossary or check on the existing definition. Link to the Glossary for Managed Fork instead of repeating the effort. Only write here what is needed to understand the document. Explain that the document will branch into VDT and non-VDT installation and help the reader decide what he wants.
List all steps that will be explained in this document.
%ENDTWISTY%


---++ Install using Condor from the VDT
If you want to use Condor from the VDT, installation is simple:
<pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
pacman -get  %CACHE%:ManagedFork
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
</pre>
Sourcing setup.sh a second time is to load the Condor environment after !ManagedFork is installed.  

Note that installing %CACHE%:ManagedFork will install a local Condor that is only used for ManagedFork jobs.

%ENDTWISTY%

---++ Install using an existing Condor

Many site administrators have a pre-existing Condor (for the cluster's batch system, eg.) and wish to use it, rather than another copy of Condor, for Managed Fork jobmanger. The installation process is similar, but make sure you have =VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION= and =VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG= defined as discussed in PreparingComputeElement in order to specify your Condor installation.  The installation is done in same directory as the OSG CE software. Further reading on this is available  [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/existing-condor.html][here]].   Setup these variables, then do:
<pre class="screen">
# The variables in %RED%red%ENDCOLOR% are the likely defaults if you installed Condor via RPM.  Adjust them if necessary
VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=%RED%/usr%ENDCOLOR%
VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG=%RED%/etc/condor/condor_config%ENDCOLOR%

cd $VDT_LOCATION
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
pacman -get  %CACHE%:ManagedFork
</pre>

---++ Enabling Managed Fork 

---+++ Enabling using configure-osg
In the [Managed Fork] section of the config.ini file, 
just put in 

=enabled = %(enable)s=

and the correct commands to enable the managed fork job manager will be executed for you via the configure-osg utility.  

*Note:* once ManagedFork is enabled, you must do the following to disable it:
   * set =enabled = %(disable)=
   * run the manual step documented below


---+++ Enabling manually

To configure the default jobmanager to be the Managed Fork jobmanager, execute the following command.

<pre class="screen">
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork y --server y
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Explain this in some more detail - say what the default jobmanager is and that the reader has to perform this step.
%ENDTWISTY%

---+++ Configuration suggestions
By default, the Managed Fork jobmanager will behave just like the fork jobmanager.  If you wish to restrict it, you need to modify your local Condor configuration.  If you're using Condor from the VDT this can be done by editing =$VDT_LOCATION/condor/local.&lt;hostname&gt;/condor_config.local=.   Here are some configuration suggestions:

   * Only allow 20 local universe jobs to execute concurrently: 
<pre class="programlisting">
   START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20
</pre>
   * Set a hard limit on most jobs, but always let grid monitor jobs run (strongly recommended):
<pre class="programlisting">
   START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20 || GridMonitorJob =?= TRUE
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
The configuration should go before the enabling, shouldn't it?
%ENDTWISTY%

---++ Disabling Managed Fork
To put back in place the default fork jobmanager (i.e. to disable the Managed Fork), execute the following command:
<pre class="screen">
# source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
# $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork n --server y
</pre>

Also, if you are using configure-osg, set the following in the [Managed Fork] section of the config.ini file to prevent ManagedFork from being enabled the next time you run configure-osg:

=enabled = %(disable)s=

---++ Further Details on Managed Fork
For more details on setup and configuration, refer to the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/notes/Globus-ManagedFork-Setup.html][VDT Managed Fork Jobmanager Release Notes]].

%STOPINCLUDE%

---++ Verify the Correct Operation of MangedFork

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
Include a verification test, output from log files that helps the admin to check if things are working as they should.
