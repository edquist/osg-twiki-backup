%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators of a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. It describes the function and installation of the !ManagedFork job manager.

---+ About !ManagedFork

[[Documentation/GlossaryM#DefsManagedFork][ManagedFork]] is an optional service which replaces the default fork job manager with Condor to manage incoming fork requests.  Commands such as =condor_q= and =condor_history= can be used to see the actual command lines of the fork jobs during and after execution, providing an important logging capacity.  More importantly, the number of fork jobs can be controlled with a configurable policy to help ensure that the CE is not overwhelmed by fork jobs.  This is a very important consideration: the standard fork manager allows a user to accidentally or maliciously "fork bomb" a CE.  As such, Managed Fork is highly recommended.

%IMPORTANT% The Managed Fork job manager does not schedule fork jobs onto compute nodes in the execution pool. Using a Condor local universe, the jobs are still scheduled to the CE headnode, but since the local universe is used they should run quickly and without delay unless a scheduling limit for the CE has been reached. 


---+ Requirements

   * a %LINK_PACMAN% Installation
   * a [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall][Compute Element Installation]]
   * a stand alone [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCondor][Condor]] Installation (optional)

The installation routine will install Condor as provided by the %LINK_VDT% _unless+ two environment variables are defined pointing to the _existing_ Condor installation and its configuration file:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=%RED%&lt;Path to Local Condor Installation&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG=%RED%&lt;Path to Local Condor Configuration File&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---+ Installation

The installation consists of following steps:

   1 change your working directory to your local VDT installation
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install !ManagedFork
   1 update your environment

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cd $VDT_LOCATION
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get  %CACHE%:ManagedFork
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
</pre>

---+ Configuration

---++ Enable !ManagedFork 

There exist two ways to enable the !ManagedFork job manager on your %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%:

   1 edit =config.ini= and use =configure-osg= _(preferred method)_
   1 use =configure_globus_gatekeeper= _(manual method)_

---+++ 1. Use the Preferred Method

Open the main configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini= and _enable_ !ManagedFork in the =[Managed Fork]= section:

<pre class="file">
;===================================================================
;                              Managed Fork
;===================================================================

[Managed Fork]
; The enabled setting indicates whether managed fork is in use on the system
; or not. You should set this to True or False
enabled = True
</pre>

then execute =configure-osg= in the root directory of your VDT installation:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% configure-osg
</pre>

%NOTE% To _disable_ !ManagedFork repeat the above steps, but choose =False= instead of =True=.

---+++ 2. Use the Manual Method

To configure the default jobmanager to be the Managed Fork jobmanager, execute the following command:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork %GREEN%y%ENDCOLOR% --server %GREEN%y%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

   * the =--managed-fork y= option modifies the service definition in =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/services/jobmanager-fork=
   * the =--server y= option ensures that the =globus-gatekeeper= file is copied to =/etc/xinetd.d= 

%NOTE% To _disable_ managed fork use =--managed-fork n=!

---++ Fine Tuning

By default the !ManagedFork job manager will behave just like the fork job manager. To adjust the behavior two steps are required:

   1 Edit the Condor Configuration file. Here are two examples:%BR%<i>Allow only 20 local universe jobs to execute concurrently:</i><pre class="file">
   START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20</pre><i>Set a hard limit on most jobs, but always let grid monitor jobs run (strongly recommended):</i><pre class="file">
   START_LOCAL_UNIVERSE = TotalLocalJobsRunning < 20 || GridMonitorJob =?= TRUE</pre>
   1 Reconfigure Condor by using =condor_reconfig=:<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% condor_reconfig</pre>

%NOTE% In case Condor has been installed by the VDT the configuration file is located at =$VDT_LOCATION/condor/local.&lt;hostname&gt;/condor_config.local=.


---+ Verify the Correct Operation of !ManagedFork

The following instructions reque a valid %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRID_PROXY% _or_ %LINK_GLOSSARY_VOMS_PROXY%.

   * Submit a simple job to _your_ gatekeeper:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% globus-job-run %UCL_HOST_FQDN%/jobmanager-fork /bin/sleep 900</pre>
   * While the job is running log into your gatekeeper and query Condor:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q -constraint 'JobUniverse==12'</pre>
   * The command line output should provide a list of all !ManagedFork jobs that are currently running:<pre class="screen">
2784794.0   fnalgrid       10/7  22:19   0+00:00:11 R  0   0.0  sleep 900 
</pre>

   1 For more details refer to the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/notes/Globus-ManagedFork-Setup.html][VDT Managed Fork Jobmanager Release Notes]].


---+ FAQ

   * *Q* Can you use the same condor installation to run regular jobs on a condor cluster and managed fork jobs? %BR%%GREEN%Yes!%ENDCOLOR% If =$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION= is set during installation of !ManagedFork and during Globus-Condor-Setup then both kinds of jobs will run in the same condor installation.
