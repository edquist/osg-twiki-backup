---+ Introduction

---+ Requirements

---++ Host and OS
---++ Users
---++ Certificates

For CEMon to run, you need to have a host or service certificate in =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=. These files need to be owned by the =tomcat= user. The simplest thing to do is to copy your host certificate.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% mkdir /etc/grid-security/http
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cp /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% cp /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown -R tomcat /etc/grid-security/http
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chmod 0400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
</pre>

Note that you want to copy, not move, the hostcerts - Globus still expects them in the original location.  

---++ Networking

---+ Installation Procedure

---++ Installing Storage Element

At this point, you should install your storage element, by following one of the instructions
on the [[Documentation/Release3.NavAdminStorage][Storage Overview]] page, such as
a standalone [[Documentation/Release3.InstallOSGBestmanSE][BeStMan server]].

---++ Installing Information Providers

To install the information service provider and CEMon, perform the following command.
<pre class="rootscreen">
yum install osg-se-cemon
</pre>


---+ 6.0 Information systems 

OSG sites report information about their site to OSG. This is particularly important for WLCG sites, which need to be present in the BDII information service so the WLCG can run jobs on these sites. However, this is important for all OSG sites because the information is used for site discovery.

---++ 6.1 Generic Information Provider (GIP)

The Generic Information Provider (GIP) is a program that discovers information about your site. It only discovers the information: other software propagates that software to OSG.

Configuration of the GIP happens entirely via the =/etc/osg/config.d/*.ini= files. These are the same files that are used by =osg-configure=. 

[[Documentation.Release3.NavTechGIP][More information on configuring the GIP]].

---++ 6.2 CEMon

CEMon runs the GIP, then pushes its data to OSG. CEMon runs inside of =tomcat=, which runs as the =tomcat= user.

For CEMon to run, you need to have a host or service certificate in =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=. These files need to be owned by the =tomcat= user. The simplest thing to do is to copy your host certificate (see requirements above).

Make sure =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= exists, even if it is empty: <pre class="rootscreen">%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% touch /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile</pre>

%WARNING% There is a minor problem in the GIP installation. For now, run the following commands to ensure the GIP will work properly:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown tomcat /var/log/gip
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown tomcat /var/cache/gip
</pre>
