---++ Validating gLexec
Instructions on how to install and configure gLexec are at [[GlexecInstall][Glexec Installation Guide]].  This 
guide is only given for users to validate a site and see if it is running gLexec 
or not.  This has been simplified by use of the =$OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION=
variable which is defined by each site when the configure-osg script is run.

Here's a simple shell script that will check if a site has glexec installed and configured
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# $OSG_GRID should be location of worker node client and glexec is 
# assumed to be in that location.
if [ "$OSG_GRID" != "" ] && [ -d "$OSG_GRID" ] 
then
     . $OSG_GRID/setup.sh

     # make sure the proxy file is local
     localproxy=/tmp/testproxy-`date -Is`
     cp $X509_USER_PROXY $localproxy
     export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT="$localproxy"

     export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT="$X509_USER_PROXY"
     cd $OSG_GRID
     if [ -x $OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION ] 
     then 
          ls -l $OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION
          ldd $OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION
         $OSG_GLEXEC_LOCATION /usr/bin/id
     else
         echo "glexec binary not found" 
     fi 
     
     # cleanup the local proxy
     rm -rf $localproxy

else
      echo "\$OSG_GRID not found"
fi
</pre>

Make a file of this script, and then submit it as a job to the resource that is being tested,
using Condor-G or other globus submit tools.
If it is successful, it will show a uid/gid as the last output on standard out.
If not, it will abort.
