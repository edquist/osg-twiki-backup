---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: Suchandra, Gabrielle, Anand
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #4321
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes

---++ ReSS ClassAd validity
   * Validation executed periodically (once an hour)
   * Anand suggested splitting attributes into critical attributes and non-critical attributes 
   * http://home.fnal.gov/~garzogli/ReSS/ClassadValidity-ITB.html 
   * http://home.fnal.gov/~garzogli/ReSS/ReSS-int-ClassadValidity.html
   * Should some of the more involved tests be used?  
      * External tools might be better, condor has crashed on more complicated regular expressions
   * Most sites passing, the sites that are failing may be due to client scripts timing out

---++ Review of critical site attributes and updates to https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/AttributesSubcommittee
   * Need more experience in order to determine if changes are needed to this list
   * Basic automated checks but not extensively checked
   * Should be hesitant to remove attributes, should only add new attributes if needed

---++ BDII validity
   * There have been problems with bdii having incorrect information (updates, values being inverted)

---++ Cross validation BDII and ReSS
   * Mainly a set of queries to ReSS and BDII and a routine to compare the two
   * gip validate collects and analyzes bdii information (perl code available)
   * validation of ReSS done by new ReSS ClassAd validity (need to use condor_status to collect information or web services)
   * efforts for this may become available after 0.8.0 release
   * probably better to tackle validating attributes on each system individually first and then look at cross checking

---++ Storage attributes
   * Ted Hesselroth has been working on understanding the semantics and implications of these attributes
   * Ted has been discussing attributes with other implementers of the srm interface and been trying to make sure everyone is using the same definitions
   * Need further real world experience with implementations to see what attributes are important and what changes may be needed

---++ gLexec and other worker node environments
   * No way to systematically advertise this currently
   * GlueService might be solution (*need to check on this*)
   * Adding attributes might break bdii or ldap so we need to be careful with this
   * Need testing if we plan on adding attributes, would be useful since other groups having been looking at this
   * A discussion on this with Igor and attributes subcommittee might help
   
---++ detailed check of persistent ITB sites
   * ReSS ClassAds check out on sites
   * UC_ITB having problems on gip validator, other sites fine
      * Due to OSG_DEFAULT_SE being left undefined (no se associated with ce)
      * *Need to check with Burt to see if WLCG requires this and what information this would be in default case*

---++ AOB
   * A lot of cemon are due to osg or gip misconfiguration
      * CEMon depends on attributes from gip and if this isn't defined then CEMon goes crazy
      * CEMon developers have tools that check some of this
      * Checking this information would help in resolving a set a problems that seems to come up frequently and which is difficult for admins to fix
