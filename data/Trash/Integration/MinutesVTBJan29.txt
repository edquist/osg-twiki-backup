---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  Jeff, Ted, Rob, Suchandra, Neha
   * Apologies: Alain, Xin
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, *#1212*
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes 

---++ VTB support for VDT

   * ValidationTestbed schedule, from Rob and Alain:
      * dCache testing (& wsgram tests/summary) moving forward now
      * vdt validation cycle to begin ~end of Feb
      * new vdt release will be after all-hands meeting

---++ dCache on VTB

   * Testing scripts for fermi srm clients and space reservations in tar-file at [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/dcache/tools//testing/][dcache tools testing area]]
      * Jeff's Notes:
         * ran =fermi-srmclients-test-v2.py= against fnal server which performs 18 tests
            * with voms-proxy from <b>star</b> and directory in config changed from =sdss= to =star=, get 2 failures from invalid =star= directory
            * changed config dir from =star= to =osg= and got 5 failures related to permissions problems
            * changed voms-proxy to <b> osg </b>  with =osg= directory and  got 0 failures.
            * Neha confirms these results are reasonable
   * Installation Reports:
      * Goal is to have 3 sites validated this week and available for targeted VO testing from Atlas and CMS
      * Report from UC (Suchandra)
         * UC site is up with dcache 1.8.0 and has passed initial tests. 
         * currently full installation on single machine with 900GB
         * will try to add additional pool with additional machine  
      * Report from LBNL (Jeff)
         * installed dcache 1.8.0 but have not passed initial tests as it looks like gridftpdoor is not configured
         * currently full installation on single machine with 350 GB
         * can also try to add another pool with additional machine
      * Report from BNL (Xin):
         * Is working on a fresh install of dcache 1.8
         * The VDT/OSG [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras/InstallingDcacheForOSG.html][Install guide]] doesn't cover all questions in config-node.pl
         * It's assumed dcap runs on every door nodes, and each pool is write/read pool in the config-node.pl, which is not always true. One has to edit site-def and later the config file. It's clear from docs that this is ok, but not much guidance on dcache layout options.
         * I see this error from pnfs node vdt-install.log: <pre class=screen> error: File not found by glob:
/opt/vdt-dcache-SL4_32-2.1.2/install/../RPMS/compat-postgresql-*.rpm </pre>  While postgres server looks started and running fine. Is this a known issue or we should report to SE group?
   * Software news (Ted)
      * New dcache patch is soon to be released which will be labeled Release Candidate 2
      * Brian is testing space manager



---++ AOB
   * VTB meeting time:  we agreed to keep with this timeslot (Tuesdays 3:30PM Central) into the future.
