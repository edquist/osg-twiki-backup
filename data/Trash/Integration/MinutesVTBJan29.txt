---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  
   * Apologies: Alain, Xin
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, *#1212*
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes 

---++ VTB support for VDT

---++ dCache on VTB

   * Testing scripts for fermi srm clients and space reservations in tar-file at [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/dcache/tools//testing/][dcache tools testing area]]
   * Report from UC (Suchandra)
   * Report from LBNL (Jeff)
   * Report from BNL (Xin):
      * Is working on a fresh install of dcache 1.8
      * The VDT/OSG [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras/InstallingDcacheForOSG.html][Install guide]] doesn't cover all questions in config-node.pl
      * It's assumed dcap runs on every door nodes, and each pool is write/read pool in the config-node.pl, which is not always true. One has to edit site-def and later the config file. It's clear from docs that this is ok, but not much guidance on dcache layout options.
      * I see this error from pnfs node vdt-install.log: <pre class=screen> error: File not found by glob:
/opt/vdt-dcache-SL4_32-2.1.2/install/../RPMS/compat-postgresql-*.rpm </pre>  While postgres server looks started and running fine. Is this a known issue or we should report to SE group?
