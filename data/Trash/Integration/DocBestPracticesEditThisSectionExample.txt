%EDITTHIS%

A twiki variable (EDITTHIS) has been created to simplify the use of the feature and to provide consistency.  The syntax for using this can be seen by clicking on the button above.  It has been setup in this manner so that the button does not display when creating the documentation in PDF format.

This is useful when creating a twiki topic for inclusion in another topic. Some reasons for using it are:
   * to reduce the physical size of the topic that uses it.
Placement of this directive is dependent on where you are using the INCLUDE'd topic.
   * If a TOC line is to be part of the INCLUDE, I would suggest it be placed immediately after that TOC entry as this is used. 
   * Otherwise, it should be the first line after the  !%STARTINCLUDE% directive.

%STOPINCLUDE%
