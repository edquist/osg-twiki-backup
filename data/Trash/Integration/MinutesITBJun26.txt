---++ ITB Cycle Review
   * Documentation should start sooner: 
      * Only had a week in this cycle
      * People aren't comfortable in editing documentation
      * Put in comments module so people can comment on pages in twiki?
      * Problem in getting experts to write the documention with an eye to installation
      * Parallel documentation review? Have a documentation team spend a day or two exclusively on documentation?
      * Anyway to improve documentation as a community
   * *Earlier warning about major changes (e.g. configure-osg.py / RSV)*
   * Have a freeze earlier in cycle ?
   * Announce a schedule earlier and have regular status updates ? 
   * Versioning repository (using subversion repository)

---++ Ongoing 1.0 Installs / Updates
   * Ian experiences:
      * Sent email to osg-sites, following highlights:
      * GUMS problems 
      * configure-osg.py problems
      * problems with Condor-cron / ipv6 / srm / OLD_VDT_LOCATION 
      * documentation issues / out of order (hyperlinking doesn't make sure when admin should start installation)
      * Not clear when to stop services
      * Not sure when configuration scripts should be run (at the end or as bits get downloaded)
      * Problems with documentation on srm/bestman
      * Ian would be available to help and can provide a novice that can "test" the documentation instructions
      * Link to troubleshooting guides
      * GOC (Rob or someone from GOC team), Alain, Suchandra, Jeff will help Ian and try to fix installation documentation using Ian's guidance
   * Steve experiences:
      * Make sure rsv user is present and proxy file is in place
      * New linux systems may have default entries for port 2119, 2811 
   * Xin:
      * Configure-osg.py exception ( print out section where exception occurs), better debugging
   * Michael Thomas (4 problems):
      * Regression (monalisa information not being set)
      * Feature request for configure_monalisa (allow user name)

---++ AOB
