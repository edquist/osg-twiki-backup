---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: Steve Timm, Arvind, Charles Bacon, Tim, Anand, Jeff Porter, RobQ, Stu, Horst, Karthik
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesdays, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes 
   * ITB 0.7 background
      * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
      * ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable

---++ Changes to attributes / schema
   * Steven is seeing an interesting problem with fermigrid:
      * Fermigrid has multiple heterogeneous subclusters
      * Number of job slots gets multiplied by subclusters resulting in overreporting of # of free cpus available
      * Matching on an individual node in a specific subcluster is difficult to do (matching on CEs and subclusters might help here)
   * Other issues (site specific services, e.g. ws-gram, nfs lite):
      * Possibly need extensions to the glue schema
      * GlueService attributes might work
      * Need to investigate whether these will work or whether it'll break the bdii (Steven will investigate this)
        
---++ Future plans for attributes subcommittee
   * Should reconvene about a month or so after the next release to discuss changes/new attributes
   * Somewhat of a requirements gathering process
   
---++ BDII server issues (RobQ)
   * Four options to deal with issues, will be discussed in today's facility meeting
   * No decision but there are several options
   * Running multiple services will fragment information onto different servers
   * Rob will see what EGEE is doing in with schema updates

---++ WSGRAM testing progress (Jeff, Suchandra)
   * Jeff's report
      * ran thru Validation steps against persistent ITB set
         * 2 sites had config issues - both now fixed
         * 2 sites with permission issues - unresolved
         * remainder were successful
      * began scaling tests from ITB (vdt-181) submit host w/ gsiftp installed from vdt:Globus-Base-Data-Server
         * simple Condor-g submissions against FNAL, TTU, BNL, & LBNL services 
         * scaling up to 100 jobs per submit-file (condor -version 6.8.6, configured with defaults)
      * results were generally successful
         * small fraction of jobs fail with "Staging error for RSL element" (FNAL & BNL) 
         * Large load on LBNL service (reaching 20) causing a larger number of "Staging errors for RSL element"
         * Need to apply performance recommendations and ask rest of ITB group
   * Suchandra will start testing this week
 

---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo WS-GRAM validation (Jeff, Suchandra)

   * Jeff's report
      * Working with STAR admin (Wayne) and Grid developer (Leve)
      * Using SUMS (STAR job scheduler) built appropriate job files and condor-g submit file for gt2
      * modified submit file for gt4
      * modified job files for submission from my ITB client (STAR production clients currently do not support gt4)
      * ran jobs against FNAL, TTU, BNL - so far each have had distinct errors 
         * shared lib missing on FNAL - now fixed and rerunning
         * TTU - source $OSG_GRID/setup.csh produced an error
         * BNL - gridftp of results back to submit host failed  
   * Suchandra's report
      * Britta (LIGO) has a ws-gram enabled workflow
      * Has submitted against UC_ITB but ran into problems
      * Resubmitting to UC_ITB and submitting to other permanent ITB sites (Fermigrid and BNL)
      * Need LIGO 
   * VOs have concerns in regards to the version of the osg-client package, using ws-gram depends on a newer version of the client than distributed with 0.6.0 
   * Uptake might have to wait until osg 0.8.0 due to problems with condor 6.8.2/6.8.3 and firewalls

---++ Last minute changes
   * Repositories will be frozen today so any changes should be given to Suchandra *ASAP*

---++ AOB
   * None
