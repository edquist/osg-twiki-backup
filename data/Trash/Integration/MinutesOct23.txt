---++ WSGRAM testing progress (Jeff, Suchandra)
   * Jeff's report
      * ran thru Validation steps against persistent ITB set
         * 2 sites had config issues - both now fixed
         * 2 sites with permission issues - unresolved
         * remainder were successful
      * began scaling tests from ITB (vdt-181) submit host w/ gsiftp installed from vdt:Globus-Base-Data-Server
         * simple Condor-g submissions against FNAL, TTU, BNL, & LBNL services 
         * scaling up to 100 jobs per submit-file (condor -version 6.8.6, configured with defaults)
      * results were generally successful
         * small fraction of jobs fail with "Staging error for RSL element" (FNAL & BNL) 
         * Large load on LBNL service (reaching 20) causing a larger number of "Staging errors for RSL element"
         * Need to apply performance recommendations and ask rest of ITB group

 

---++ VO WS-GRAM validation (Jeff, Suchandra)

   * Jeff's report
      * Working with STAR admin (Wayne) and Grid developer (Leve)
      * Using SUMS (STAR job scheduler) built appropriate job files and condor-g submit file for gt2
      * modified submit file for gt4
      * modified job files for submission from my ITB client (STAR production clients currently do not support gt4)
      * ran jobs against FNAL, TTU, BNL - so far each have had distinct errors 
         * shared lib missing on FNAL - now fixed and rerunning
         * TTU - source $OSG_GRID/setup.csh produced an error
         * BNL - gridftp of results back to submit host failed
