---++ Motivation
This proposal is to add =excluded_groups= from the =Condor= section in the config.ini.  These allow Condor administrators to exclude particular Condor accounting groups from publication.

---++ Scope
The =excluded_groups= will be added to the Condor jobmanager.

---++ Effects / Changes
The =excluded_groups= is optional; if it unset, the GIP will follow its normal behavior.  If =excluded_groups= is set to a comma-delimited list, we will not publish information about groups in the list.  It is case-sensitive.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with GIP 1.1.9 (to be included in OSG 1.2.8?)

---++ Current Status
Posted to osg-int for discussion.
