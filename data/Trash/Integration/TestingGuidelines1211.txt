---++ Specific Instructions for OSG 1.2.11

---+++ Test Bestman/Xrootd software
Install the software as outlined in the release documentation.  Make sure that you can upload, download, and delete files and verify that files downloaded from your SE are the same as the files that you uploaded.

---+++ Test srm client
To test the update to the srm client tools, use the client to upload, download, remove, and list files on a SE and verify that uploaded files match the downloaded files.

---+++ Test  reporting
Verify that your ress, bdii, gratia, and rsv reports are being sent to the central collectors.  Also check monalisa if you are using this service.

---+++ Test GUMS
If you have a GUMS server in your ITB cluster, install and verify functionality.  Otherwise, check and verify that the gums-host-cron command works correctly and generates the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt= file if you are using GUMS.
