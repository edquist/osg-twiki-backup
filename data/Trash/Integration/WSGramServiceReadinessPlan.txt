---++Introduction

From the Globus website:

[[http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/execution/key/index.html#s-key-index-overview][GRAM Overview]]

See also, VDT release notes: (to be provided)

---++Readiness and Integration Plan

We describe a service readiness and integration plan for WS-GRAM and the OSG ITB, following guidelines set forth in NewOSGServices with the nominal target ITB release ItbRel014 and later. Since the service is already developed and "ready", the following focuses on integration aspects.

---+++ Description of Service

[[http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/execution/key/WS_GRAM_Approach.html][WS GRAM Approach]]


Again, quoting from the Globus website,

<verbatim>
Features new in release Globus Toolkit 3.9.5

	 * x
	 * y
	 * z.


Other Supported Features

	 * On the client side, we provide a scriptable client side tool called globus-url-copy. This tool can take advantage of all the GridFTP protocol features and can also do protocol translation between FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, and posix file IO on the client machine.
	 * We also provide a set of development libraries and APIs for developers wishing to add GridFTP functionality to their application.

Deprecated Features

	 * None

</verbatim>


---+++ Dependencies and interactions with other services

WS-GRAM runs in a GT4 Java container along with other GT4 services.

WS-GRAM requires access to an RFT service for file staging, and a GridFTP server must be running on (or have access to the files of) all nodes that files will be staged to and from.

---+++ Resources required

Server installation is all that should be required.

The GT4 container should be run (as user FIXME) from xinetd.  The xinetd entry is created by the VDT package install or can be created manually, and should be configured approxinately as follows:

<verbatim>
FIXME: xinetd.d/GT4ServiceContainer (name tbd) here
</verbatim>

---+++ Installation Procedure

On the server (head node) which will run the WS-GRAM Service Container

On the server which will run the RFT Service Container:

- FIXME: RFT requires a database; 4.0.0 only supports PostgerSQL; 4.0.1 supports MySQL as well.  (Future releases may support loightweight embedded daataases that can be installed automatiucally, transparently to the sysadmin).

On the submit hosts: setup of GT4 GridFTP server:

- the GridFTP server should be started on every submit host as root (see http://FIXME)

- if you cannot run a root GridFTP server as root, you can run one under a normal userid, as follows: FIXME

You then need to do the fllowing when you submit jobs, so that the proper user credentials will be used instead of host ceredntial to validate access to the GridFTP service: FIXME.

Client tools run on the submit hosts:

globusrun-ws

globus-cred-delegate (Java!  FIXME: what needs to be done here to enable this to run?  Where do these tools need to run? just on submit hosts, or on otehr grid nodes and user machines???)  This tool creates a delegated credential (FIXME: link to explain what these are, when they are needed, how they are managed and used).  Gets EPR to use on invocation of globusrun-ws.  FIXME: Link to describe what EPRs are and how they are used and managed.

wsrf-destroy

wsrf-query

globus-job-run-ws (FIXME: wrapper around gobusrun-ws to make it more like globus-job-run with a greater degree of backwards compatibility)  Prototype exists - need to make available but nodecision yet on wheteher its really needed and if it will be supported.  Need opinons from the community on this?

Condor-G issues:

WS-GRAM servers can be used with very little change by Condor-G jobs.

You need the following versoin of Condor-G x.x.x (FIXME) which is supplied in VDT version x.x.x (FIXME).

WIth this version ypou need the following submit file changes:

FIXME - describe sub fike changes here



---+++ Open Issues

- what container should the RFT service run in - ho wmany of these in OSG?  One per site, one per VO, or one (or a few) per Grid?


---+++ Migration Guide and Backwards Compatibility Issues

Most existing clients will still work.  Some problems have been reported with ...


Using WS-GRAM through globusrun-ws, users will need to deal with:

	* FIXME:
	* credential delegation
	* forming job desriprion document (XML)
	* managing EPRs?

FIXME: Java container does a command.run of sudo of the rm-adapter (a perl script). Auth rules for sudo need to be configured.  All users in grid-mapfile must be listed in sudo conf file. (But there rae other ways to handle this that dont requir listing every user???)  WIll these work for all/most OSG sites? What are any possible issues and interactions with OSG AAA?

FIXME: GridFTP file access mapping issue: will supply a default for the mapping: / to /.

FIXME: What contact string do we need to apply in GridCat to list WS-GRAM servers?  Describe new contact string here:

Old: host:port/service:subject

New: https://host:port/path-to-service(always fixed)FIXME  then -t type (for PBS, Fork, etc)

FIXME: provide details on changes to COndor-G submit file here

FIXME: provide details on changes to COndor-G behavior, performance, and error loging / debugging techniuques here.

---+++ Known Issues and Problems


---+++ Server requirements

Appropriately configured GSI security.  An exisiting GT2 security install will work.

---+++ Packaging

Comes with VDT 1.x.y and later, via Pacman 3. 

---+++ Installation and Configuration

Installation is provided by VDT. All you need to do is:
<pre>
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/%OSG_ITB_VDT_VERSION%:Globus-WS-GRAM-Server
</pre>

The server will be automatically configured, but ...

Platforms for which binaries are available:  need to coordinate this with VDT team.

Config steps in the WS-GRAM Admins doc section:

- copy or link host cert to container{cert,key}.pem in /etc/grid-security

- configure rm-adapter (FIXME: correct name here)  - assuming you are using Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE.  Others need to: FIXME

- configure sudo (FIXME: how to handle continual changes to gridmap file, and group accounts etc? Interaction with OSG AAA mechanisms)

---+++ Testing and Validation

FIXME:

Somehow (FIXME: via VDT???) we do a full install in the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/test/WS-GRAM (FIXME) directory. There will be a file called TESTS.pl that the administrator can run after all services have been installed and started.

It sets up its own environment, all you need to have is a valid proxy. (FIXME: need to give exact instructions on how to start, and how to point the tests to the installed server rather than have ot start ots own server)

Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one understanding everything is working properly? Are all required functionality tests successful?  Describe details of the integration test (what constitutes success?).  Describe the plan.

---+++ Scalability and Metrics

Note that as of GT3.9.5, the server will, by default, send back usage statistics to ANL.  This can be disabled.  You can also define additional targets for sending the stats and OSG could collect VO wide usage stats.  The receiver for the stats is not included in the toolkit (or VDT), but is available from CVS.

The stats provided for WS-GRAM usage include: FIXME.  These can be utilzed by OSG as follows: FIXME.

FIXME: (From Rob:) What are the expectations in terms of performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful integration?

The currently available measurements on WS_GRAM performance are posted at:  FIXME

	* docs/4.0/perf_overview.html
	* docs/4.0/execution/wsgram/reports/FIXME
	* test results from Jens/Mats/Gaurang are at: ...

FIXME: need to add here a summary of the major perf# form the automated tests wen 4.0.1 is cut.  (new links in WS GRAM Quality profile?)  FIXME

Measrurements for "# jobs queuable" - 32K was tested - show results

Measurements for 

Test links to bugzilla with all parts neede to enable OSG users/admins to rerun these tests (these are the ones where the test procedures are written up in the bugzilla bug)

Tests going out in 4.2 Trunk (HEAD) - needs updates to AXIS and thus not going out in a 4.0 branch...
