---++ Introduction

This report summarizes results obtained running tests against WS GRAM services deployed on integration test sites during preparation for and post-deployment of OSG-0.8 software release.  Each of the following section describe a series of tests, their purpose, and the results of the tests.  

---+++  WS GRAM Tests on ITB

The OSG integration cycle leading up to the OSG-0.8 software release included installation, configuration, and functionality testing of WS GRAM service on OSG's Validation and Integration test beds.  The purpose of this effort was to:

   * Apply a defined set of installation and configuration procedures for WS GRAM deployment on OSG, to:
      * Debug those procedures on a variety of sites
      * Document the procedures in the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GlobusWebServicesInstall][OSG WS GRAM Installation Guide]]   
   * Develop a suite of tests to determine WS GRAM service functionality for OSG
      * document these tests for general use, see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ValidateGramWebServices][WS GRAM Validation Procedures]]
      * have each site admin apply these test on their own sites 
   * Run more targeted tests on individual ITB sites
