---++ Overview of the validation (David M)
   * See SiteValidationTableITB052
   * David requests each site admin rerun site_verify.pl to ascertain their site is properly configured.
   * A few misconfigured sites have been detected in the last day.
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo application validation to begin ASAP.
---++ Reports from Sites on ITB 0.5.2 (ITB site admins)
   * Highlights:
      * Grow_ITB site should not be used. A re-installation of the OSG 0.5.2 cache will occur next week after a disk reformatting.
      * FNAL_FERMIGRID_TEST was configured today and should now be stable.
      * ITB_INSTALL_TEST_3 may be mis-configured in GridEx. David to contact the GridEx folks.
      * The two PBS sites are off-line due to the problem related to env. vars and the Globus-PBS driver. Alain is investigating the problem.
      * UC_T2DEV_ITB is actually managed by Suchandra.
---++ Progress on CEMon stability issue (Tanya)
   * Tanya reports that with 24 hours of testing, no site with yesterday's  patch has had a memory problem and all of those sites are reporting to FNAL.
---++ Progress on CEMon reporting to BDII (John R, JohnW and Gabriele)
   * JohnR has completed code to map VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names to site names and tested this code.
   * David recommends testing secure transport of BDII information from an ITB site to the BDII aggregator at IU.  Data is now sent in the clear.
   * JohnW has added config information to support log4j logging so that systems admins can determine when a site has communicated with the BDII aggregator.
   * Gabriele asks for input on how development should proceed. Here is his description of the trade-offs from an email exchange with Alain:

---++ Gratia accounting (Philippe)
   * Philippe reports over 90% of the ITB successfully installed the GratiaProbe and are reporting to the aggregator. He believes this component is ready to go.
---++ Grid exerciser results (David)
   * David will update the GridEx column tomorrow based upon the GridEx stats tonight as there is some reconfiguration work that has occurred in the last day.
---++ WS Gram validation (Jeff P, Suchandra)
   * Jeff retracts the results he posted via email in the last day.
   * There was a clock skew error at his measurement site when he tested ws-gram. That problem has been fixed and Jeff will test again this week and report.
---++ Other ITB 0.5.2 issues
   * Steve Timm requested working voms-proxy-xxx clients on 64 bit platforms. Tim believes the 32 bit code should work on 64 bit machines. This needs to be tested.
   * Steve has requested that a syntax problem exists related to GUMS:
      * The dash "-" should be supported in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names.
      * The dot "." should be supported in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names.
      * ACTION ITEM:  Ransome and Oscar need to be contacted to work this issue.
---++ Documentation (Jeff, Forrest, John W)
   * What is the state of DocumentationTable?
   * Jeff will due a fast first pass through the OSG 0.5.2 install guide and initial and date each section that needs attention. Then we will put together a team to revise this
document as a top priority. Steve T and John W discussed the priority of needing to run configure_osg.sh prior to running vdt-control during initial configuration and that this
fact is not documented yet.

---++ State of the VDT (Tim)
   * Work is proceeding on VDT 1.6.1a which will have a number of bug fixes. 
      * Schedule for VDT 1.6.1a soon but could be a week away.
      * A Validation Test Bed installation will occur as soon as VDT 1.6.1 a is ready.
      * PBS fix is still being worked. Not completed yet.

---++ RT Roundup
   * Handles all of these in the preceding sections.
