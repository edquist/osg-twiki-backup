---+ Virtual Workshop for ITB Rel 0.5

%TOC%

---++ Background

This goal of this virtual workshop will be to install ITB 0.5.2 on a number of sites in advance of the deployment of the next production release of the the OSG 0.6.  The deliverable of this workshop will be a testbed that will enable further service validations (especially information and accounting services) and application validation by VOs.  This workshop will be similar to the one held in March of last year, VirtualWorkshopMar06.

   * Release description is available here: http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/WebHome (see further for CE install documentation, etc).
   * We need volunteers to help with all phases of validation and documentation, in addition to checking the installation at your site.
