---+ Virtual Workshop for ITB Rel 0.5

%TOC%

---++ Background

The goals of this virtual workshop are:

   * Install ITB 0.5.2 on a number of sites in advance of the deployment of the next production release of the the OSG 0.6.
   * Find problems and provide feedback to VDT.
   * Capture experiences and installation/config tips, updating the Integration.ITB_0_5.DocumentationTable for the purposes of provisioning OSG 0.6.

The deliverable of this workshop will be a testbed that will enable further service validations (especially information and accounting services) and application validation by VOs.  This workshop will be similar to the one held in March of last year, VirtualWorkshopMar06.

   * Release description is available here: http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/WebHome (see further for CE install documentation, etc).
   * We need volunteers to help with all phases of validation and documentation, in addition to checking the installation at your site.

   * The ValidationPage should contain instructions for validating services.  The site validation table should include check-off's for passing tests for:
      * VORS
      * GIP/CEMon validation via the resource selection service
      * GIP/CEMon validation via the BDII service
      * Gratia accounting
      * More, tbd

---++ Pre-Workshop
   * Site registration
      * [[Integration.ITB_0_5.CEInstallGuide#OSG_Registration][Registration Instructions from Installation Guide]]
   * Certificates
   * Clients

---++ Getting Started
   * The Integration.ITB_0_5.DocumentationTable holds the setup of relevant documentation links.  Note they are not up to date for the current release.   *One of the goals of the integration fest is to make a good start at getting these documents up to date*, in preparation for OSG 0.6 provisioning and deployment.  

---++ Action items and issues

   *  Need to update  Integration.ITB_0_5.DocumentationTable with a minimum of changes in advance of the workshop so that ITB site admins have a good starting point for contributing.
