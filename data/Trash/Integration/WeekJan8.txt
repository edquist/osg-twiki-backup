---+ Integration Report for Week of January 8, 2007

---++ Individual reports

   * Reports from [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/DavidsWeeklyJan8][David Meyers]], [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/wiki/bin/view/OSG/WeekJan09][Suchandra Thapa]], [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/JeffPorterWeeklyJan08][Jeff Porter]] and [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/OSGReports/RobWeekJan08][Rob Gardner]].
   * Efforts on-going at the GOC for the CEMon collector and the ITB 0.5.2 cache.
  
---++ Summary 

 VTB and ITB meetings both held last week, focus on getting ready for ITB 0.5.2 (based on VDT 1.6.1). My summary taken from the summary given to the ET:

   * Notes from integration meeting, http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/MinutesJan11
   *  I wanted to call your attention to schedule slippage.  As of a VTB meeting on Dec 9  http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/MinutesVTBDec19 we were assuming the following schedule:
      *  We have ITB completion deadline for OSG 0.6.0 deployment on 2/15/07.
      * VDT 1.6.1 to be released at the end of the the first week of January and will include things we find during VTB testing. This will be the ITB release (for ITB 0.5.2, to be released on 1/8/07.)
   * We are stil in the pre-release testing of VDT 1.6.1 on the VTB.  Things are progress well, but we're behind; I don't expect the VTB (pre-ITB) cache to be finalized until next Tuesday though much testing will happen between now and then.   I would expect sometime next week we would be ready to give Alain the green light on VDT 1.6.1 and simultaneously release ITB 0.5.2 for broad deployment and testing. At that point we would have wide exposure to many ITB sites, and be prepared for application validation. This depends on the remaining issues to be resolved/completed:
   * the OSG configuration scripts, which include the GIPs and CEMon
   * the CEMon-BDII subscription/configuration script, collection service and GIP validation off BDII via this path.
   * Some final Gratia setup modifications which should be very quick

   * New target for ITB release 0.5.2:  1/19/07
   * Three weeks of ITB testing (1/22 to 2/9) 
<Possible iteration for new issues uncovered in the ITB>
   * Hand over to Provisioning process which includes all pre-deployment preparations; OSG 0.6.0 deployment begins.
   * Note - the ITB 0.5.2 release description is at http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/WebHome which I would urge the ET to follow and comment on.
