---++ Lightning talk: RSV (Arvind Gopu)
   * What is RSV? 
      * Site level validation of resources and services that run on them
      * We provide default scheduling infrastructure based on Condor-cron
      * Default set of probes including critical OSG probes
      * Site level web interface to RSV results for all hosts being monitored by that site admin
      * Results of local site validation tests are uploading into a central GOC maintained RSV database.
      * Data exchange between OSG GOC and WLCG SAM for interoperability
   * How can I get RSV? [[http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/vdt-package.html][RSV Install Guide]]
   * Can I contribute probes to RSV? Yes! In fact, we welcome OSG collaborators and site admins to contribute probes for specific tests they think will be useful to the OSG community as a whole
      * You can use Perl module we've developed as a starting point, and plug in tests into a template script
      * Or, you can write your own scripts in any other programming language, as long as they conform to the [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/GridMonitoringProbeSpecification][WLCG probe specification 0.91]] w.r.t input parameters they take and output they print out; and some additional OSG specific requirements (that are necessary to facilitate uploading of data into central RSV database).
      * Expect more documentation about both of the above options RSN
   * Why [[http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/why-condor-cron-for-rsv.txt][condor-cron instead of Unix-cron]] ??
   * Questions: please email [[http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/rsv-contact-info.html][RSV developers mailing list]]
   * Coming soon: Updated RSV in VDT 1.8.1a -- includes capability to use existing Condor 6.9.x install; and monitoring multiple CEs from one monitoring host; web interface to local RSV results; RSV documentation in the rsv.grid.iu.edu domain.
