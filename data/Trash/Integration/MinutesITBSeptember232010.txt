   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p21.html][Changes]] 
   * Highlights:
      * PRIMA, GIP, Fetch-CRL are the changes that will probably affect most people
      * globus-job-manager won't source setup.sh 
         * Size of environment should be smaller
      * Tomcat default memory increased
      * configure-osg changes
   * Open issues
      * CA certs probe

         * Other ITB sites are green
         * Probably due to rsv probe issue (fix with VDT, next release should have fix)
         * Next production CA release should have new layout 
            * Will have new package for ITB testing in the next few weeks
