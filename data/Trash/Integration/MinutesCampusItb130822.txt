---++ Featured tutorial: Pegasus workflows on the Open Science Grid infrastructure (Mats Rynge)
Pegasus is a workflow management system for managing
scientific workflows across desktops, campus clusters, grid and cloud
resources. In this forum, we will be running some simple workflows on
Open Science Grid. Attendees will learn about how to get started, basic
workflow transforms such as task clustering, and how Pegasus can help
run workloads more reliably on a distributed system in an automatic
manner. Additional topics include data placement, and generating
statistics and graphs from provenance data collected during workflow
execution.

*Mats Rynge* is a computer scientist in the Science Automation Technologies group at USC Information Sciences Institute in Los Angeles, CA. Mats is a Pegasus developer, and an OSG User Support team member.

Mats will start with some slides that you can download here: [[%ATTACHURL%/Pegasus-OSGCIC-iForum.pdf][Pegasus-OSGCIC-iForum.pdf]]

You can find the content of the tutorial [[https://confluence.grid.iu.edu/display/CON/Using+Pegasus+to+manage+jobs][here]]

---++ Campus Infrastructures Community Workshop 
The Campus Infrastructures Community Workshop at Duke University is next week, August 27 and 28.
   * [[https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=6863][Here is the agenda]]
   * [[http://osgcic-duke.eventbrite.com/][Here the registration]]

---++ BOSCO 1.2 testing
[[CampusGrids.BoscoQuickStart][BOSCO]] 1.2 and [[CampusGrids.BoscoR][BOSCO-R]] are available . Any feedback is more than welcome. Feel free to add comments to this page or email us at  bosco-discuss@opensciencegrid.org .


---+++ BOSCO and BOSCO testing background
If you are not familiar with BOSCO, there is a short introduction, describing also the tests, attached to the [[MinutesCampusItb130110][1/10 minutes]]:
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]]
Bosco documentation is available also in:
   * http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoSCO
The easiest way to install BOSCO is using the [[CampusGrids.BoscoQuickStart][quickstart guide]]

BOSCO testing focuses on three main use cases:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing and how to contribute to it.
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives also an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.
