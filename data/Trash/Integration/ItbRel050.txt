---++Introduction

This is a release description for the OSG ITB 0.5.n series of Integration testbed deployments.

---++ Planning Documents

Will catalog here documents associated with the OSG 0.6.0 release.

   * January OSG consortium meeting slides on OSG 0.6.0 [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=340][here]].
   * [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=382][NFS-lite]] document by Terrence Martin
   * ITB Pacman cache, for inspection http://software.grid.iu.edu/itb/


---++ VO requirements

We need an applications matrix to discuss specific VO requirements for 0.6.0.  Information that has been given:
   * See AtlasWishList060
   * CDF has a specific request for Squid. %Y%

---++ Backgroud discussions

   * [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A1=ind0606e&L=osg-int&O=T&H=0&D=0&T=1#2][On required services and what constitutes a default CE]]
   * [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A1=ind0607a&L=osg-int&O=T&H=0&D=0&T=1#1][MIS job manager and hung processes cleanup]]
   * ...

---++ Handling incremental facility upgrades

It is expected the upgrade to OSG 0.6.0 will need to be performed incrementally, not all sites upgrading at the same time, and perhaps upgrading their services one at a time.  This will additionally have implications on the ITB, but also for the deployed production OSG facility.

Questions:

   * How to characterize a site's provided services?
   * How to publish, disseminate plans for these upgrades (deployments), so as to set VO expectations.


---++ Policy

Need to revisit the description and publication of site and VO policies.

   * Site policy templates
   * VO policy templates


---++ Compute Element

The following is taken from slides at the Florida OSG consortium meeting (1/06):

<pre>
AAA based on RBAC with certs from VOMS.
GLUE schema 1.2
Possibly extensions for storage
Version 2 not likely before LHC startup.
Plans for June 06:
No ws as part of baseline services in LCG
New RB using condor-c is part of this release. Not clear how exactly this will be deployed. Will figure this out between now and May!
Concern about interoperability!
Gt4 pre-ws -> ok
Gt4 ws
Condor-c
</pre>
