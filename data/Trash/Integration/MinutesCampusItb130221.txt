---++ HTC session at the OSG All Hands meeting
OSG All Hands meeting is on 3/11 to 3/14. On Thursday 3/14 there will be a hans-on session with two tracks. One track is dedicated to HTC and will include tutorials on:
   * How to install BOSCO
   * How to use OASIS to distribute your application
   * How to submit a job using (Bosco and) skeleton_key (to access your application on OASIS)

There is a twiki page to write the requirements and put the tutorial material (directly or linked):

---++ BOSCO Testing 
[[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

The three main use cases are:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check Trash/Trash/CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing.

Xin was able to add the custom attributes and run the tests at BNL.
Bosco works but he'd need something more dynamic: the attributes are used to select the queue and may change from time to time.

Derek suggested that there is a recipe using scripts to have remote requirements/attributes. He will communicate it to Xin and add it to the advanced section in the Bosco documentation.

The Bosco documentation mentions that the Bosco submit host cannot run a Condor collector. It is not clear that Bosco starts a collector and the warning refers to a separate collector (not the Bosco one). Marco will fix the documentation.

Horst had Bosco submitting jobs to LSF (OSCER). Condor jobs are submitted and run fine but Condor is returning exit code 1. Horst and Derek will investigate.
Derek has also on the way patches to use LSF_ENV (describing where the main config file is) and configure correctly a LSF cluster within Bosco.
---++ Feedback to Developers
It would be nice to have support for 32 bit hosts, specially RHEL5 32bit. And in the current documentation it is not clear that only 64bit machines are supported. (Horst)

---++ Installation support and issue tracking


---++ AOB
