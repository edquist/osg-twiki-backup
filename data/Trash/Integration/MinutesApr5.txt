---++ WS Gram 
   * See page WSGramValidation060 for a summary of testing results.
   * Suchandra doing native submissions, Jeff Condor-G
   * Jeff: service comes down after a certain rate.  Built submission scripts for a variety of different tests - causes server to fail.  Watches load rise on service host.  Trying to re-run tests on the UC t2dev site.  More details on failure:
   * Condor-G submit of a simple script. Fails at a queue length of 120 jobs (def file descriptors, def memory), where jobs are few minutes.  Not sure if its a cluster-specific problem.   
   * Have not seen anything amiss in the container log. 
   * Stu: found that increasing the number open file descriptors to at 16K.
   * Alain: note also default memory as shipped from VDT is the default max heapsize for the container 512MB; Suchandra has tested at 1 GB.
   * Stu: need to look at why things break at 16K.
   * Stu notes that with Condor-G the 16K fd's may not be required.

---++ OSG Attributes
   * See page AttributesSubcommittee
   * Anand: we have one more week for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's to submit requests for *critical* attributes.  After that the goal is to move to Glue schema 1.3 - identifying new attributes, and possibly more as critical. 
   * Storage was the last place where there was work to do.  Ted has marked a few more attributes as critical.  There is an issue of srm inserting portions of the root path - has checked how UCSD.
   * Need to review  the three SE's "succeeding" in http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_results?grid=2
   * Interop (Burt): patch for configure-gip -- by Monday.   Also, w/ John R and Laurence Field about info not getting propagated through the BDII at the GOC.  Still waiting to see EGEE-brokered job land on an OSG site.  May have happened already.  Burt will put his ITB site online and will send jobs through RB's to his ITB-CE.  95% confident that with VDT patch all is good.  

---++ Storage testing 
   * John R; starts from the OSG registration database. 
   * See http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_results?grid=2
   * Has three sites passing tests.
   * Most attributes are being set correctly.  Two distinct parts - the information collection, and then unique IDs must be found.  This will test that critical storage attributes are being presented correctly, and if they work.

---++ Syslog-ng
   * See SysLogNg and http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/Logging/SyslogInstall as an example.  Suchandra will be providing recommendations for the VTB, and will setup a central VTB logging service for monitoring and debugging.
