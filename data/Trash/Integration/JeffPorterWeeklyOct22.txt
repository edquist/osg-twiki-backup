---++ Monday

   * WS GRAM testing on 2 fronts
      * started working through the STAR's workflow to modify it for using WS-GRAM
      * setup to do simple Condor-g scaling tests on all ITB sites from my local submit host
   * Iterated with STAR folks and configured workflow for test on FNAL, BNL, TTU, and LBNL ITBs
   * used same set of ITBs for simple scaling test (plus LIGO ITB)

---++ Tuesday

   * continued gathering WS-GRAM results and modifying STAR WF 
      * failure for STAR WF on TTU is odd and independent of STAR - requested help from admin
      * missing lib for STAR on FNAL is fixed
   * attended VTB meeting and reported status on WS-GRAM testing
   * attended local group meeting

---++ Wednesday
   
   * attended NERSC grid meeting, primary discussion of online-CA proposal  
   * suspended STAR WS-GRAM tests as we discovered it may conflict with their normal Validation process
   * worked with CompBioGrid folks to understand their Client problem

---++ Thursday

   * iterated local group about adding itb-bestman tests
   * further cleaned up Client install documentation and validation 
   * attended ITB meeing - reported WS-GRAM testing status and noted Condor version in client (6.8.6) is not optimal for WS-GRAM (6.9.4)

---++ Friday

   * discussed CompBioGrid problem with them (no DNS mapping and behind a firewall) - requested similar setup on PDSF to test & document 
   * began installation of Condor-Devel package on client to test and document its use on client-submit host
   * started making plots of simple scaling WS GRAM tests but 'staging error' failures make plots of little value
