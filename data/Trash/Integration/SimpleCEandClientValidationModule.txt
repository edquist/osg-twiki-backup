---++ Requirements

This page includes a series of tests to check the basic functionality of a CE from an OSG Client. It assumes you have:

   * access to an OSG Client summit host.  For many of the test this should include running Condor for Condor-G submissions.
   * a target CE with known/knowable characteristics
      * hostname
      * jobmanager types
   * access a personal grid certificate in order to retrieve a valid grid/voms proxy with privilege to run on the target CE
