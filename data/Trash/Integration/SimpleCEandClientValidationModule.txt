---++ Requirements

This page includes a series of tests to check the basic functionality of a CE from an OSG Client. It assumes you have:

   * access to an OSG Client summit host.  For many of the test this should include running Condor for Condor-G submissions.
   * a target CE with known/knowable characteristics
      * hostname
      * jobmanager types
   * access a personal grid certificate in order to retrieve a valid grid/voms proxy with privilege to run on the target CE

---++ Basic CE Testing

Several component tests of the CE installation are documented in the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ValidatingComputeElement][Validation]] section of the Release documentation.  Since we're not requiring that the site resources be registered, we will stick to testing functionality of the services not the information repositories.  The tests of the CE should be done as a user with a valid grid proxy.


Many of the basic system tests can be checked quickly via the =site-verify.pl= script installed with the OSG CE package. The script should be run as a normal user with a valid user grid proxy.
