---+++ Testing and Validation

---++++ Components Changed
The full list is available here: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p22.html

Highlights:
   * Updated the Gratia Gridftp probe's configuration 
   * Updated the Generic Information Provider to version 1.1.12
   * Updated the OSG Discovery Tools to version 1.0.6
   * Added useful exit codes to vdt-control
   * Set the default EMAIL_DOMAIN in our Condor installation to a more restrictive setting.

  In addition, please try the following specific tests related to software components that we've updated:

   * If you are running ITB 1.1.26 or later, let us know how the new update process works.
   * If you are running either the Gratia Gridftp or Glexec probes please validate them
   * Ensure that your site is reporting to BDII and !ReSS correctly (we have upgraded the Generic Information Provider)
   * Fermi (this change is probably not interesting to other sites) - please test the new accept_limited change.  Add =accept_limited = True= to your config.ini in the [Managed Fork] section.
   * Suchandra - try out the new vdt-control exit codes to see if they will provide you the information you need.

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the VDT support center or any other support center as the recipient since that will cause a email loop*
