---+++ Testing and Validation

---++++ Components Changed
The full list is available here: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p23.html

Highlights:
   * The CA certificate management scripts (=vdt-update-certs= and =vdt-ca-manage=) have been updated to deal with the new CA Certificate package
   * Bestman and SRM-Client-LBNL have been updated to version 2.2.1.3.16
   * Bestman2 and Bestman-Client have been updated to version 2.0.3
   * The =VDT_LOCATION/logs= directory will now contain symlinks to some component log directories

---++++ Testing

Admins should try the steps outlined in the General Testing Guidelines:

%ENDTWISTY%

  In addition, please try the following specific tests related to software components that we've updated:

   * If you are updating from ITB 1.1.26 or later, let us know how the new update process works.
   * If you use the 'include' or 'exclude_ca' features of =vdt-update-certs= please test them.
   * After updating your site (specifically, after running =vdt-postinstall=) look in the =VDT_LOCATION/logs= directory.  This now contains symlinks to various other component log directories.  This is an initial effort for making logs more accessible and if any other components can be linked let Scot know.
   * Bestman and friends have already been tested by the VDT storage team.  Feel free to update and test if desired but we do not require any more testing before the release. 

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the VDT support center or any other support center as the recipient since that will cause a email loop*
