   * From last meeting: _OSG_SQUID_LOCATION environmental variable that is set in configure-osg that we presently force users to use that want to use a site's squid cache from programs such as =wget=.  Should we set http_proxy directly, and not require users to use the environmental variable? Steve T thinks yes.  UCSD thinks not.  Discussed collecting more information in operations meetings - Rob Q will put this on the agenda of the next meeting(s).  Alain will provide the recipe for setting http_proxy directly._
