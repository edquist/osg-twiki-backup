---++ Notes
Concerns on reliability of GOC servers
   * Identify all GOC services
   * Monitor reliability of GOC services 
   * Review reliability in October
   * Use information for SLA agreement in October

It would be useful to start a Nagios project to monitor critical GOC resources:
   * monitor if resources are up
   * send an email if the resource is not up
   * provide selected view of GOC resources

Suchandra has a MyOSG view to monitor selected resources. He will add it to the ITB page
