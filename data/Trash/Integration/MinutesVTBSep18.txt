%TOC%

---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: 
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes

---++ ITB 0.7.0 background
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.WebHome
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.SiteValidationTable

---++ VTB cycle for VDT 1.8.1 (Suchandra)
   * Status of VTB cache

---++ Shortcomings in service validation table 
   * There is not enough detail in Integration/ITB_0_7.ValVORS to be useful.  Example: *which* tests are supposed to be check for success?  Check VO support matrix.  Check BDII information... 
   * There is not enough information in the Integration/ITB_0_7.ValBDII to be useful.  Which tests succeed (provide example of successful ldap query output)?  Are CE and SE critical attributes reported correctly?  URLs are provided, but what is important to check there?
   * There is not enough detail in Integration/ITB_0_7.ValReSS to be useful.  Obviously a pre-requisite to run the valdation is an exisiting condor client (not mentioned).   What should this data look like (provide an example)?   The "web based representation" - what is being checked in detail?
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.ValGratia - should be clarified.  Is it enough to see that Gratia has contacted the site?  Are instructions for Gratia collector relevant for all sites?
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.ValWSGram - instructions are too thin for the Condor-G submission test. Can't we bring forward some of the WS-gram testing scripts?
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.ValSysLogNG - instructions are incomplete.  Should not be logging to /tmp.   Need to add php-syslog-ng based validation checks. 
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.ValClients - this is weak and needs input. 
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.ValSquid - can we add more detail with explicit examples (for the first part about setting the http_proxy environment to the squid proxy host)
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.ValgLexec - does not exist; there was an outline of instructions from Igor sent around

---++ VORS validation status
   * Grid scan: http://scan.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_results?grid=2  (needs to be pruned to 13 ITB sites)
   * VORS [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi?grid=4&VO=0&region=0&res=0&dtype=0][ITB vew]] 
   * Why are "resource access points" available for some sites but not others?
   * gk.phys.sinica.edu.tw:2119 should be removed from the table


---++ !ReSS validation status
   * The !ReSS is supposed to capture the CE critical attributes, as specified https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/GIPAttributes.
   * Are all sites reporting into https://osg-ress-4.fnal.gov:8443/cgi-bin/main.cgi correctly?  

---++ BDII validation status
   * The BDII is supposed to capture both CE and storage critical attributes, as specified https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/GIPAttributes
   * Most ITB sites are failing this, according to http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu/itb/
   * http://is-itb2.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi  - are *critical attributes* being reported correctly?  Why are not all sites reporting?

---++ RSV validation status
   * Why have so few sites checked off in the validation table?
   * http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/vdt-package.html#test_output
   * Are the 13 sites reporting correctly?

---++ LCG interoperability status
   * No sites have checked off in the validation table - is this intentional?
   * Have all sites correctly applied the patch distributed by Burt?
   * Are there any additional actions required by the ITB site admins?

---++ glexec validation status
   * What course to take given Steve's findings

---++ Squid validation status
   * We need one or two sites to step forward and test this.

---++ Gratia validation status
   * Where is ITB instance? ans: http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8881/gratia-reporting/
   * Why is IPAS_OSG, Harvard, others listed?
   * Are the 13 ITB sites correctly reporting?
   * Can we easily get a snapshot of VO usage?

---++ Storage validation status (dCache)
   * Where are the detailed instructions for this? for site admins/for users
   * Where are testing results being reported, eg. http://datagrid.lbl.gov/ has no information about OSG ITB 0.7 storage element test results


---++ Storage validation status (Bestman)
   * Where are the detailed instructions for this?  for site admins/for users
   * Where are testing results being reported, eg. http://datagrid.lbl.gov/ has no information about OSG ITB 0.7 storage element test results

---++ Hello (fermi) grid results
   * http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/monitor/fermigrid0-fermilab-vo-integration-monitor-detail.html
