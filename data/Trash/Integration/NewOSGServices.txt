---++Introduction

New services may be introduced into the OSG at any time.  The OSG Integration Activity aims to
facilitate integration of new services with existing services and core infrastructure.  The
process is driven by _service proponents_, experts behind the service providing the technical
know-how for successful integration.  This may involve formation of an OSG Activity depending on
the scope and scale of the project.


---++ Service Readiness Template

The following is a simple outline for service proponents to follow while preparing services 
for the OSG integration testbed.

	* Overall (brief) description of the service, and expected duration of the service within the ITB.

	* Description of dependencies and interactions with other services.

	* Resources required -- are clients/agents/info providers etc. to be installed on all sites?

	* What are the server requirements (is a central discovery server /repository needed/provided, etc)?

	* How is it packaged?

	* Provide installation *and* configuration instructions.

	* Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one understanding everything is working properly?

are all required functionality tests successful?

* scalablity tests - what are the expectations in terms
of performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful 
integration.

* contact information for support of the service in the integration
phase (as distinct from production operations in the OSG)

* linkes to documentation


A one or two pager is all that is required.
