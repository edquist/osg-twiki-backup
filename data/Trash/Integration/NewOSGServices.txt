---+!!New OSG Services
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction

New services may be introduced into the OSG at any time.  The OSG Trash/Integration Activity aims to
facilitate integration of new services with existing services and core infrastructure.  The
process is driven by _service proponents_, experts behind the service providing the technical
know-how for successful integration.  This may involve formation of an OSG Activity depending on
the scope and scale of the project.

   * *Service Readiness Template*: the following is a simple outline for service proponents to follow while preparing services for the OSG integration testbed.


---++Description of the Service

   * Overall (brief) description of the service, and expected duration of the service within the ITB.

---++Dependencies and Other Services

   * Description of dependencies and interactions with other services.

---++Required Resources

   * Resources required -- are clients/agents/info providers etc. to be installed on all sites?

---++Server Requirements

   * What are the server requirements (is a central discovery server /repository needed/provided, etc)?

---++Packaging

   * How is it packaged?

---++Installation and Configuration

   * Provide installation *and* configuration instructions.


---++Test Harness

   * Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one understanding everything is working properly? Are all required functionality tests successful?

---++Validation

What is required for meaningful validation, both _functional_ and _scalability_ tests.

   * Scalablity tests - what are the expectations in terms of performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful integration.

   * Known problems, limitations, and pending issues.


---++Contact Information

   * Contact information for support of the service in the integration phase (as distinct from production operations in the OSG).


---++More Documentation

   * Links to documentation, native home pages, related twiki topics, etc.

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/service-template.ppt][service-template.ppt]]: Example presentation of a service readiness and integration plan (powerpoint)
