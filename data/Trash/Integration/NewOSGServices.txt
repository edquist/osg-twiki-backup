---++Introduction

New services may be introduced into the OSG at any time.  The OSG Integration Activity aims to
facilitate integration of new services with existing services and core infrastructure.  The
process is driven by _service proponents_, experts behind the service providing the technical
know-how for successful integration.  This may involve formation of an OSG Activity depending on
the scope and scale of the project.

   * *Service Readiness Template*: the following is a simple outline for service proponents to follow while preparing services for the OSG integration testbed.


---++Description of the Service

   * Overall (brief) description of the service, and expected duration of the service within the ITB.

---++Dependencies and Other Services

   * Description of dependencies and interactions with other services.

---++Required Resources

   * Resources required -- are clients/agents/info providers etc. to be installed on all sites?

---++Server Requirements

   * What are the server requirements (is a central discovery server /repository needed/provided, etc)?

---++Packaging

   * How is it packaged?

---++Installation and Configuration

   * Provide installation *and* configuration instructions.


---++Test Harness

   * Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one understanding everything is working properly? Are all required functionality tests successful?

---++Validation

What is required for meaningful validation, both _functional_ and _scalability_ tests.

   * Scalablity tests - what are the expectations in terms of performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful integration.

   * Known problems, limitations, and pending issues.


---++Contact Information

   * Contact information for support of the service in the integration phase (as distinct from production operations in the OSG).


---++More Documentation

   * Links to documentation, native home pages, related twiki topics, etc.

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/service-template.ppt][service-template.ppt]]: Example presentation of a service readiness and integration plan (powerpoint)
