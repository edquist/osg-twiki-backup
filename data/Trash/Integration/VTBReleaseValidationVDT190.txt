---++ Jeff's vdt-191 notes:

   * SELinux check during vdt-install is new.  If enabled (true on my site), it gives a warning + 30 seconds to turn it off and restart install, otherwise it just goes on. This leaves a residual issue in one's mind.  My question becomes: will problems observed with SELinux enforcing cause install failure or other issues later?  %RED% Alain modified the warning %ENDCOLOR%
      * Should document "cat /selinux/enforce" and "echo 0 > /selinux/enforce" to turn off
   * ldiff file error messages still on pbs during ==configure-osg.sh== ... will ignore
   * Site verify and GRAM jobs (both pre-WS and WS) run fine
   * Certs were downloaded correctly with new model
   * RSV:
      * condor-cron worked fine.  (I never looked for or used any condor-cron specific commands)
      * softlink from old configure-osg-rsv location works - Thanks!
      * config and spec files copied over from OLD_VDT_LOCATION - Thanks!
      * basic machinery is working fine
         * http://<i>hostname</i>:8080/rsv now redirects to https://<i>hostname</i>:8443/rsv    ... don't remember that from before? %RED% Was told this was always the case %ENDCOLOR%
         * If you try to connect before html file exists, you get a "permissions" error at browser.  Combined with the above is confusing
      * at time of writing, I'm waiting for all the probes to activate... so far so good.
         * condor_status command not found for classadd-valid probe. %RED% Arvind sees that it needs ==condor-cron_status== instead and will fix in next update %ENDCOLOR%
      * When I edited the config file and reran ==configure_osg_rsv== , I was in my install session where $OLD_VDT_LOCATION was still defined. That caused my old config file to be recopied over, overwriting my changes. 
   * Gratia looks good
   * Syslog-ng is configured to osg-log.uchicago.edu:5145 and is getting connection refused
   * ReSS/BDII/CEMon ....
      * Ok on: [[http://is-itb2.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi][CEMon BDII integrated Server Status]]
      * Ok on: [[http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu/itb/index.html][OSG-GIP Validator]]
      * but problem seeing anything with either condor_status or ldapsearch commands. %RED% Sent email to Tanya %ENDCOLOR%



---++ Jeff's vdt-190 notes:
   * ldiff files missing during configure-osg.sh (in configure-osg-gip) for pbs site (not SGE site) <pre class=screen> Can't open static ldif file: /opt/osg/vtb-0.9/gip/etc/osg-info-gip-config/osg-info-static-ce.conf
Can't open static ldif file: /opt/osg/vtb-0.9/gip/etc/osg-info-gip-config/osg-info-static-cesebind.conf
... executing configure_gip script as
/opt/osg/vtb-0.9/vdt/setup/configure_gip</pre>
      * Burt now thinks this is not a problem - %RED% Artifact of new (python) code not needing these files and old code still testing for them %ENDCOLOR%
   * Site verify and pre-WS GRAM jobs run on both sites
   * WS-GRAM:
      * works on pbs site (LBNL_VTB)
      * does NOT work on sge site (NERSC-VM-VTB0)
         * SEG fails, even when running by hand: <pre class=screen>/opt/osg/vtb-0.9/globus/libexec/globus-scheduler-event-generator -s sge -t 1206393076
Fault: globus_xio_system_select.c:globus_l_xio_system_cancel_cb:665:
Operation was canceled </pre>
         * %RED% Alain thinks just needs a rebuild and will update today/tomorrow %ENDCOLOR%
         * %RED%  NOW FIXED %ENDCOLOR% From dev install - though I found a small memory leak that I'll follow up on.
            * This means my NERSC-VM-VTB0 site is down while I follow through on memory leak
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS:  old GUMS server issue has my sites failing on VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS.... should be fixed as of this afternoon
      * LBNL_VTB is listed (but failing) --- %RED%Now fixed and reporting successfully %ENDCOLOR%
      * NERSC-VM-VTB0 is not listed
   * Cemon log file moved from =tomcat/v5/logs/glite-ce-monitor.log= to =glite/var/log/glite-ce-monitor.log=
   * BDII:
      * ldapsearch finds LBNL_VTB 
      * ldapsearch doesn't find NERSC-VM-VTB0
   * ReSS:
      * condor_status doesn't find LBNL_VTB %RED% Found problem with my httpcert %ENDCOLOR%
      * condor_status finds NERSC-VM-VTB0, but web listing shows it failing: isClassadValidAreTotalSlotsAndCPUPositive
   * Gratia 
      * probe OK on PBS site for both pbs and condor (managedfork)
      * "SiteName" set incorrectly for sge probe on SGE site - it used the hostname instead. %RED% sent note to Chris and Shreyas %ENDCOLOR% - no word yet. Talked with Shreyas but haven't tested his suggestion
         * probe is reporting though not linked to "NERSC-VM-VTB0"
            * I fixed "SiteName" probe/sge/ProbeConfig but problem persists
         * condor (managedfork) is correctly linked
   * RSV:  %RED% Sent feedback to rsv-dev %ENDCOLOR% They are looking at the items
      * 'configure-osg-rsv' script is in osg-srv/setup instead of vdt/setup/ . Either that is a mistake or the docs are wrong.
         * %RED% Not a mistake, new design, Alain will soft-link to satisfy docs %ENDCOLOR%
      * my <i>nodename</i>_metric.conf files weren't copied over from previous install
      * classadd probe points to production ReSS collector osg-ress-1.fnal.gov
   * GUMS:  
      * I am in the process of reinstalling my GUMS Server so as to test RSV probe
