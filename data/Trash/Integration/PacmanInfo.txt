---++Installing and Setting Up Pacman
Pacman is a package management tool that allows you to define, install, and configure software.
The homepage of Pacman is http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/. 

Pacman version 3.16.1 should be used for the OSG 0.4.1 installations.

---+++ Download
First, =cd= to an install directory somewhere.  Then:<br>
=> wget= http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.16.1.tar.gz

---+++ Unpack and Setup
Then unpack the tarball:<br>
=> tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.16.1.tar.gz=

Next, setup your environment:<br>
=> cd pacman-3.16.1=

For =sh= and =bash= shells:<br>
=$ source setup.sh=

For =csh= and =tcsh= shells:<br>
=% source setup.csh=

---+++ Installing OSG software using Pacman
These are general instructions for installing software from a Pacman cache.<br>
=> mkdir INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY  (e.g. /usr/local/osg)= <br>
=> cd INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY= <br>
=> pacman -get OSG:PACKAGE_NAME= <br>


---+++ Unsupported Platforms
If you get an error message indicating ".....is not yet supported", you may need to specify the pacman command with the following argument:<br>
=> pacman -pretend-platform:RHEL-3 -get OSG:ce= <br>
where you could substitute any platform for RHEL-3.

To see a list of the defined pacman platforms (not all of which are yet supported), execute:<br>
=> pacman  -platforms= 


---+++ setup.sh issues
Pacman normally removes the <i>setup.sh</i> file at the start of an installation and, if successful, restores the file. The VDT grid middleware will fail to work if the setup.sh script is unavailable.

To allow out of date setup scripts to remain during installation or updates execute the command:<br>

=> pacman -allow save-setup=

To attempt recovery of the setup.sh file execute the command: <br>
=> pacman -setup=

 
---+++ Removing packages with pacman
If you installed a package that you may later have deemed unnecessary, you can remove it  by issuing the pacman command with the remove option.<br>
=> pacman -remove package_name= 

For details on these commands, see the <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman">Pacman home page</a>.
