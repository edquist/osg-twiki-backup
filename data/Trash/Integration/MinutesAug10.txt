---++ CEMon testing - Gabriele
   * Testing the release from VDT at fnal - John W working on that - feeding back improvements
   * John: working on configure-CEMon script. Appears to have some problems consuming CPU on data collection.  Two sensors as default (one for OSG, one for a plain CE node?).  There is a VDT ticket for this. 
   * Working with VDT and the CEMon people to resolve these issues.
   * Horst and Joel Snow - question about installing CEMon on their ITB site, and on a OSG 0.4.1 CE.
      * Currently OU has 0.3.6; will upgrade to 0.5.0 asap.
      * Have a condor pool with OSG 0.4.1 - will install it on that host.  No apache running.  Install in a different dir, will get apache, tomcat, etc. Point CEMon to use the old GIP.
      * Want also to test on a 0.5.0.
   * Instructions: see http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/CEMonAndGIPInstallationNotes. Rob will place in the documentation table.

Following up from last week:
   * Steve - not present, assume he is going to install out of VDT 1.3.11 on top of a 0.4.1.
   * Anand - working on this as well - has run into some problems.  Has it configured, but nothing getting to the apache server, need to figure out whats going on. 

---++ ITB 0.5.0
   * Release description is a mess, needs to be spruced for primetime, Integration.ITB_0_5.WebHome

      * Need to add a configure CEMon script, then its final.
