---+++ This Week
   * BNL
      * Installed wn-client on ITB worker nodes, trying to get ATLAS jobs to run
      * Working on updating the ITB test queue in PanDA
      * Got feedback from group installing the wn-client
         * wn-client updated the jdk -- can the update of the jdk be skipped?
            * Just related to the jdk versions
            * Not a problem as along as the issue isn't wanting to stay with openjdk 6 (this has incompatibilities with bestman2 client)
            * Uninstalling rpm removes jdk
         * Concern about the number of steps in procedure
         * May want a single rpm with components

         * Had questions on ini setup, Suchandra will email instructions

      * Updated worker node installs on compute nodes
