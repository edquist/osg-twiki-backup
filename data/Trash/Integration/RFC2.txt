---++ Proposal
I'd like to get people's opinions on a proposal to create a single  
directory  that would have symlinks to all of the log files generated  
by the various services and tools installed by vdt.  The current vdt  
2.0.0 software creates a log directory that contains output from the  
vdt-control command.  The proposal would be to add symlinks to other  
log files so that admins would be able to go to that directory to  
check most if not all of the logs generated by the services.

Is this something that people would like to see in a future osg  
installation?  Comments or thoughts on doing this or something similar  
would be appreciated.

---++ Current Status
In discussion / on hold since VDT is implementing something similar
