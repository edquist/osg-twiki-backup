---++ Featured tutorial: Testing your workflow on a Mac laptop (Leo Singer)
Designing a workflow for !HTCondor can sometimes be time consuming because it takes a long time to test new codes on a heavily subscribed computing
cluster. Leo will show how to install and run a local, personal HTCondor pool on a Mac. This is now made very easy by the new [[http://www.macports.org/][MacPorts]] port of HTCondor.
This turns your Mac into a miniature, personal computing cluster on which you can test and perfect HTCondor workflows before submitting them remotely.

*About the presenter:* Leo is a graduate student in physics at Caltech, where I work for the LIGO experiment on localizing gravitational-wave events and following them up optically. Leo contributes regularly to several open-source software projects, including MacPorts.


   * The tutorial's material is available on the OSG Twiki: Trash/CampusGrids.CICiForum130516
   * Follow Leo on Adobe Connect, http://osg.adobeconnect.com/cic-interactive/
   * Recordings form past !iForums or CIC Webinars are available [[http://www.youtube.com/opensciencegrid/][on Youtube]] and at [[http://www.campusgrids.org/#!iforum/cnpt][campusgrids.org]].


---++ BOSCO 1.2 testing
BOSCO is and important product of OSG Campus Grids. It is a different way to connect to HTC resources.

BOSCO version 1.2 beta is available and we are looking for beta testers!
Check the background section here below if you are not familiar with BOSCO.

---+++ BOSCO and BOSCO testing background
If you are not familiar with BOSCO, there is a short introduction, describing also the tests, attached to the [[MinutesCampusItb130110][1/10 minutes]]:
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]]
Bosco documentation is available also in:
   * http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/BoSCO
The easiest way to install BOSCO is using the [[Trash/CampusGrids.BoscoQuickStart][quickstart guide]]

BOSCO testing focuses on three main use cases:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check Trash/CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing and how to contribute to it.
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives also an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

---++ Feedback to Developers

---++ Installation support and issue tracking


---++ AOB  
   * Next meeting will be on 5/30

<!--
- Recruitment of early testers, starting with Integration community but open to others
- Providing testers with precise instructions most useful to the BOSCO development team
- Defining specific tests for various platforms and modes

        > single user versus multi-user
        > platforms
        > target clusters
        > required functional testing
        > scale testing
        > operational issues, monitoring

- Collection of feedback
- Tracking issues and bringing to bosco development group
