---+++ Testing and Validation

---++++ Components Changed
There are many changes in this release.  The full list is available here: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p21.html

Highlights:
   * Removed the sourcing of setup.sh from the Globus common job manager.  This should decrease the load on the gatekeeper, but will affect all jobs submitted via Globus. We believe that there is no functional difference that will affect jobs, but the environment will be smaller so we need to verify this. (See below.)
   * A Glexec update to version 0.6.8.3-osg3.  Highlights of the changes include:
      * Fix support for the user having done grid-proxy-init as opposed to voms-proxy-init. 
      * Change glexec_monitor to catch the SIGTERM signal and clean up including killing child processes procd and gidd_alloc. This should prevent gidd_alloc processes from being left around after a condor_rm. 
   * Updated a handful of other components including Apache, !MySQL, !OpenLDAP, PRIMA, GIP, !MyProxy, !Fetch-CRL, and LFC.  Some of these updates include security fixes.

---++++ Testing

Admins should try the steps outlined in the General Testing Guidelines:

  In addition, please try the following specific tests related to software components that we've updated:

   * Since we have modified the Globus job manager, try to submit some real jobs to make sure that they do not have environment problem ("real" means something more interesting than running 'globus-job-run /bin/hostname')
   * Ensure that your site is reporting to BDII and !ReSS correctly (we have upgraded the Generic Information Provider and made a change to Tomcat's init script which can affect CEMon)
   * Ensure that Fetch-CRL is working correctly.
   * If your site uses Glexec, please try the new version.  
   * If you are running GUMS at your ITB site, please update and verify that GUMS Server is working.  We have not updated GUMS, but we have touched Tomcat, !MySQL and Apache.
   * Steve Timm (and any other admins interested): please test the init script change for CE services.  Lock files in /var/lock/subsys should be generated for init services running on Red Hat systems.  If you are doing an update, you may need to run the appropriate configuration script (e.g. configure_tomcat) to generate a new init script.  Ask Scot if you have any questions.

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the VDT support center or any other support center as the recipient since that will cause a email loop*
