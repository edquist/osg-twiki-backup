---+++ Testing and Validation

---++++ Components Changed
There are many changes in this release.  The full list is available here: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p21.html

Highlights:
   * Removed the sourcing of setup.sh from the Globus common job manager.  This should decrease the load on the gatekeeper, but will affect all jobs submitted via Globus.
   * Updated a handful of other components including Apache, !MySQL, !OpenLDAP, Glexec, PRIMA, GIP, !MyProxy, !Fetch-CRL, and LFC.  Some of these updates include security fixes.

---++++ Testing
Admins should try the steps outlined at [[Integration.TestingGuidelines1212][the testing guidelines page]].   In addition, please try the following specific tests related to software components that we've updated:

   * Since we have modified the Globus job manager, try to submit some real jobs to make sure that they do not have environment problem ("real" means something more interesting than running 'globus-job-run /bin/hostname)
   * Ensure that the Generic Information Provider is reporting information correctly.
   * Ensure that Fetch-CRL is working correctly.
   * If your site uses Glexec, please try the new version.  The changes to Glexec were minor, but include a change to how some proxies are handled (specifically, Grid proxies as opposed to VOMS proxies).
   * Verify that CEMon is working on your CE because we have updated Tomcat's init script (so that it starts with more memory).
   * Verify that GUMS Server is working.  We have not updated GUMS, but we have touched Tomcat, MySQL and Apache.
   * Steve Timm (and any other admins interested): please test the init script change for CE services.  Lock files in /var/lock/subsys should be generated for init services running on RedHat systems.  If you are doing an update, you may need to run the appropriate configuration script (e.g. configure_tomcat) to generate a new init script.  Ask Scot if you have any questions.

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
