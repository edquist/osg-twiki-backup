---++ WS gram
   * Suchandra's testing plans:
      * test with and without prima callouts
      * save gridmanager log and the container logs after each log
      * start initial testing with sleep jobs (30s, 60s, 300s sleep) and jobs (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 jobs)
      * couple sleep with a small (~1k)  stage-in and stage-out files
      * if time permits move on to testing larger file transfers and or run jobs that do actual computations

---++ AOB
   * Testing GRAM gatekeeper for Alain:
      * Change condor submit files from ws-gram testing to use gt2 instead of gt4 
      * provides a baseline for gt4 comparison
      * will characterize new gt2 behaviour
