---++ Featured tutorial: !BOSCO-R (Marco Mambelli)
The tutorial will demo !BOSCO-R, an extension of R to take advantage of BOSCO from within the R interactive environment.
I will setup the environment and estimate the value of pi using a Monte Carlo method.
BOSCO-R is currently in alpha testing and you are welcome to test it and help us making it a better product.
