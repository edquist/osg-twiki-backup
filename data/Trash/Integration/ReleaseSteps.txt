---++ Subversion cache changes
---+++ ITB release
The pacman files for the OSG and ITB cache are located in a subversion repository that the GOC hosts.  To release a new ITB cache update, the following steps need to be taken
   * Tag a set of pacman files for the release, e.g. <pre class="screen">
[sthapa@nsit-dhcp-250-234 ~]$ svn copy https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/softwarecache/branches/itb-1.1 https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/softwarecache/tags/itb-1.1.22 -m "Tagged itb-1.1.22 release"
</pre>  The files for the itb cache for the osg 1.2 releases are kept at =https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/softwarecache/branches/itb-1.1= .  
   * Send email to the goc (goc@opensciencegrid.org) requesting the ITB cache to be updated and indicating which tag to use
   * Once the goc has updated the cache,  the files will be at =http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2/=
   * After verifying the correct files are present (ce install, site_verify passes), an announcement should go to the ITB
---+++ Production release
To release a new production cache update, the following steps are taken:
   * Tag a set of pacman files for the release, e.g. <pre class="screen">
[sthapa@nsit-dhcp-250-234 ~]$ svn copy https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/softwarecache/trunk https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/softwarecache/tags/osg-1.2.9 -m "Tag files for osg 1.2.9 release"
</pre>  The files for the itb cache for the osg 1.2 releases are kept at =https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/softwarecache/trunk= .  
   * Send email to the goc (goc@opensciencegrid.org) requesting the ITB cache to be updated and indicating which tag to use
   * Once the goc has updated the cache,  the files will be at =http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2/=
   * After verifying the correct files are present (ce install, site_verify passes), the release announcement should be sent to the goc so that they can release it to the OSG mailing lists.
