---+++ Introduction
This page has the update and testing instructions for the osg 1.0.6 (osg-vtb 0.9.7) update.


---+++ Installation 
Admins will need to install from the VTB cache.  Updating a previous release won't be possible for this round of testing.  Just as a reminder, you'll need to run
   * edit =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf= to select the url for your certs
   * run =vdt-setup-ca-certificates=
   * run =gums-host-cron= or =edg-mkgridmap= to generate your =osg-user-vo-map.txt= file
   * and then run =./monitoring/configure-osg.py= from =$VDT_LOCATION= 

---+++ Testing and Validation
Resources just need to install, configure your resource and then check your gratia accounting to verify that it's functioning correctly.  You can check this information by looking at the logs in =$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/logs/= and verifying that the logs are being uploaded. 

---++++ Components Changed
The only changes in this change are to fix security changes.  

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds


---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
