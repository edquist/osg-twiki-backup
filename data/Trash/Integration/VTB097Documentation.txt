---+++ Introduction
This page has the update and testing instructions for the osg 1.0.6 (osg-vtb 0.9.7) update.


---+++ Installation 
Admins will need to do a fresh installation from the VTB cache.  Updating a previous release won't be possible for this round of testing.  If you are doing this testing on a host that contains another OSG installation, you can shut down the services for that installation, then install into a new directory.

Just as a reminder, you'll need to:
   * edit =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf= to select the url for your certs
   * run =vdt-setup-ca-certificates=
   * run =gums-host-cron= or =edg-mkgridmap= to generate your =osg-user-vo-map.txt= file
   * and then run =./monitoring/configure-osg.py= from =$VDT_LOCATION= 

---+++ Testing and Validation
Resources need to install and configure your resource.  Then check the following things: 
   * Gratia accounting - look at the logs in =$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/logs/= and verify that Gratia records are being uploaded correctly
   * RSV Gratia reporting - look at =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/logs/consumers/gratia-script-consumer.out= and look for the presences of warnings.  If records are being sent correctly, you will see something similar to this:

<pre class="screen">
03-18-2010 22:13:30 - Executing script '/home/kronenfe/test-gratia/osg-rsv/output/gratia/1268968381-vdt-centos5-ia32.cs.wisc.edu-org.osg.general.vo-supported.3575.py'
OK - Record added to bundle (2/20)
</pre>


---++++ Components Changed
The only changes in this change are to fix security changes.  

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds


---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
