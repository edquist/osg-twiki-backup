---++ General OSG 1.2 Testing Instructions

This document is a guide to help OSG VTB and ITB tester know what to test for a given release of the VDT.

---+++ General expectations for VTB testing

VTB testers should expect:
   * To do a fresh installation, not upgrades
   * There might be a need to do multiple installations per release (as bugs are fixed)
   * The should do a basic "smoke test": Can they do an installation? Are there unexpected error messages or unusual warnings?
   * Unless otherwise informed, VTB testing should focus on verifying that the CE and Bestman SE are working. (See details below.)
   * For each VDT release, there will be description of what extra testing needs to be done for that release.
   * Do all RSV tests still pass? 

---+++ General expectations for ITB testing

ITB testers should expect:

   * Usually they can simply upgrade their ITB installation.
   * Sometimes the upgrades will fail and they'll need to try again.
   * The goal is to test the upgrade process as well as functionality.
   * The should do a basic "smoke test": Can they do an installation? Are there unexpected error messages or unusual warnings?
   * Unless otherwise informed, ITB testing should focus on verifying that the CE and Bestman SE are working. (See details below.)
   * For each VDT release, there will be description of what extra testing needs to be done for that release, and what VO testing needs to be done.
   * Do all RSV tests still pass? 

---++ Components to Test

---+++ Testing a CE

   * Installation: Did you have Pacman problems, new messages during installation, etc?
   * Configuration: 
      * Did you have problems with vdt-post-install or configure-osg?
      * configure-osg
         * Are there any undocumented changes to config.ini or unexpected behavioral changes?
         * Are there output messages that need improvement/clarification?
   * Overall:
      * Does the site-verify script return any errors?
   * Job submission:
      * Run a Globus job against the fork job manager
      * Run a Globus job against the batch system job manager of your choice (Condor, etc)
      * (ITB only) Run jobs with the Panda-based test suite 
   * Authorization:
      * Does a grid-mapfile still work?
      * Can you authorize with GUMS (via PRIMA)? 
   * Gratia: 
      * Is Gratia recording data for your batch system jobs?
         * Look at $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/logs
         * Is data reaching the central ITB collector? 
   * RSV:
      * Are all RSV probes green?
      * (ITB only) Are RSV records showing up on !MyOSG page? 
   * ITB-specific testing:
      * VO testing (As needed) 

---+++ Testing a SE

   * Installation: Did you have Pacman problems, new messages during installation, etc?
   * Configuration: Did you have problems with vdt-post-install or configure-osg?
   * File Transfer: Can you still transfer files in and out of Bestman?
