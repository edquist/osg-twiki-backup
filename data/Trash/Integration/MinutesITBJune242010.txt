---++ ITB 1.1.23 Testing
   * OUHEP
      * Noticed an error in the vdt-updater script complaining about bad backup copy
         * Cause may be due to stray globus-job-managers, condor writing into the install directory, or gratia jobs running
         * Most of these are known to the VDT team but is lower in priority 
         * *Iwona will add a note to the known issues page in the ReleaseDocumentation regarding this*
         * *Karthik will investigate this further and investigate with Scot*
   * UC_ITB
      * Installed ce, gums, client, and bestman/xrootd and haven't encountered any problems so far
      * Will upgrade back up copy of itb 1.1.22 and test this after initial testing is completed
   * TTU
      * Planning on installing next week
   * Open issues
      * Java 1.5 may not be removed in certain instances although the binaries aren't in the path
      * Scot is investigating

---++ CA Certs
   * FNAL
      * Will switch to the ITB distribution when reinstalling ITB 
   * Other sites (UC, LBNL, OUHEP) are using ITB ca certs cache
