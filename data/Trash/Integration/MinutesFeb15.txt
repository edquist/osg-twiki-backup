---++ VO testing on ITB: progress and issues (Abhishek)
   * Results so far
      * Have heard biogrid, cms, gadu, sdss 
      * sdss - have tried the four "ready" sites, table has been updated.   Trouble with the CIT site - David notes the access to compute servers is restricted.  Will annotate specific features.
      * Gadu - in progress.  Worked on the first three sites.  Note: use VORS rather than Gridcat. Still need tools for accessing data.  Still testing today - worked on two sites in the second category of sites.  Problems at BNL - but they are known problems with shared file systems.  Remaining sites in progress.
      * CMS - question from Frank, Bockjoo.  It would be good if some ITB sites are available to the LCG testbed.  Rob Q notes that information is being propagated to the OSG BDII correctly, but not sure about propagation to the LCG BDII. 
      * Compbiogrid - just getting started: succeeded with simple tests on 2 out of (18?) sites. 
      * Need better documentation for application developers - a quick start guide.
   * Schedule of VO validations 
      * d0, atlas, next week.
      * have not heard from cdf or nanohub.

---++ VDT 1.6.1a conclusions and VDT 1.6.1 - final (Alain)
   * See minutes from this week's meeting, MinutesFeb13
   * Major work on update mechanism to an existing VDT installation, nearly done.
   * 1.6.1 cache still not released - little more investigation needed to deal with the missing directory update problem.
   * Remaining issues:
      * globusrun-ws failures - related to the update problem.
      * Monalisa update - David - also possibly related the update problem.
   * Installing from scratch, no problem.
   * Release tomorrow, fixed or not, 10 am CST.
   * New VDT person - "Scott".

---++ Site-verify not recognizing a running Monalisa instance (David)
   * See BugMonaUpdateVDT161a listing - problem with site-verify.
   * John W did a fresh install - site-verify worked okay.

---++ Managed fork issue
   * Will not have it for ws gram in this update.
   * Accounting issue: condor okay for gratia and ml; but not sites with the other jm's pbs or lsf.  Need to install condor probe as well, and the way we configure ML as well.
   * Suchandra will make modifications to do this.

---++ ITB 0.5.2 update procedure (Rob Q)
   * See ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.UpdateRecipe052 for current set of instructions, now being tested.

---++ GIP validation update (Ransom)
   * See http://grow.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gipvalidate/index
   * Pull site names out of VORS, then looks at BDII.  Checks attribute type, proper URL.
   * Need: checks of interrelated components are there - CE to SE binding.
   * Would be interesting to check CEMon output with BDII output for CEs. Gabriele notes that we are comparing class ads with ldiff, no automatic translation.

---++ SRM/dCache SE (Suchandra)
   * ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.WebHome#Storage_Element_recommended
   * Development site status on UC_T2DEV_ITB - for functionality testing; problems with gsidcap and srm running correctly - in contact with dcache people at fermilab and vdt-support.  Hopefully up and running by early next week.
   * uct3 (Tier3) installation plans - for larger VO testing
   * BNL site?  On hold for now.
   * Note - we have an SE implemented as srm/dcache at fermilab, in the ITB.

---++ OSG SE testing and gridscan update  (John R)
   * See results at: http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_results?grid=1
   * Now has list of storage sites, lots of inconsistencies, missing DN information, etc.
   * Will make a version of this for the ITB.

---++ Storage information validation (Shaowen)
   * We have a mixed landscape of storage resources and information sources.  Will provide a "best practices" source of information as to how to discover and use storage resources on the OSG. 
   * Shaowen will provide some information to Abhishek, who will coordinate an OSG *applications developer's best practices guide*.  Will reference existing documentation, and how one gets information about storage.
   * David notes that we additionally need the exact path - but its provided in the GIP.

---++ WS Gram testing (Jeff) 
   * ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.TestingGram4
   * See email on tuesday - on sites running on Condor works all the way.  Will do further testing on those sites.
   * Burt will ask Brian to test against WS Gram gatekeepers in the ITB.

---++ Documentation (Rob Q, Alain)
   * ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.DocumentationTable into production readiness.  In OSG is is done as part of the *Provisioning* process, which Rob Q and Alain will be leading. 
   * Next week deadline for changes.

---++ RT Roundup
   * Resolved.
