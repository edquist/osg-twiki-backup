---+++ RT background
We are introducing RT as a system for "issues" management in both the ITB and VTB, courtesy Brookhaven National Lab (special thanks to Tomasz Wlodek for kindly setting these up).   To create an issue, simply send an email to: 
   * =rt-osg-itb at bnl.gov= for ITB issues
   * =rt-osg-vtb at bnl.gov= for VTB issues
Anyone can send email these lists, no special permission is required.  To be able to submit and view pending and resolved tickets via a web interface, and more importantly to become a "watcher" of the queues (you get an email for all submitted tickets and replies), you need to send an email to =RT-RACF-UserAccounts at bnl.gov=.   Then, you can go directly to the web interface to view tickets:
   * [[https://rt-racf.bnl.gov/rt/Search/Results.html?Query=Queue%20%3D%20'OSG-ITB'][ITB tickets]]
   * [[https://rt-racf.bnl.gov/rt/Search/Results.html?Query=Queue%20%3D%20'OSG-VTB'][VTB tickets]]
When you receive an RT email, you can reply to that mail and the ticket is updated automatically.
