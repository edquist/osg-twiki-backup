---++Installing a srm client
	* Installation Location: Vanderbilt
	* Client Used: LBNL's srm client version (http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist/client/index.html)
	* Source Obtained: From Alex Sim's group at LBNL (directly contacting them)

		* Step 1.  Obtain the client tgz. Untar it.
		* Step 2.  Install java. The client used was tested with Java 1.4.2_07. It should works with any version of	 Java 1.4.2_x. They seem to have a client version that does not have this limitation.
		* Step 3.  setenv JAVA_HOME <full path where your run time java is installed>
		* Step 4.  setenv SRM_HOME <full path to this directory>
		* Step 5.  Please obtain a user certificate from authorities like the DOEGrids. YOu can get ut from the online request system at ivdgl.org. 
		* Step 6.  Globus needs to be installed. Globus toolkit is used for generating grid proxis which the client uses.
		* Step 7.  I used the vdt for installing globus (http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documentation.html)
		* Step 8.  Once globus is installed, use /Globus install dir/globus/bin/grid-proxy-init to generate a proxy. You would need the usercert.pem and the userkey.pem set before you run this command. Point to be noted is that your grid proxies are valid only for 12 hours and they need to be regenerated using Step 8 every time it expires.

At this point you are ready to use the srm-client:
