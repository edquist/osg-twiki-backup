All, (w/ apologies for spamming multiple lists)

The OSG 0.8 release documentation  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome continues to undergo improvements, thanks to your collective efforts providing content, reviewing for clarity, and finding and fixing errors.  We've "assigned" a person responsible for every topic in this web - in some cases we may not have chosen the right person.  Feel free to complain and otherwise suggest a re-assignment, or delegate to another expert as you see fit (hint to Facility area managers!).  In some cases we've made only educated guesses and may not have the right person identified (some of these topics are multi-authored and have been revised many times).

We would like to complete the editing and review process by Wednesday, November 21.  

To that end the Review Status, https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ReviewStatus lists persons responsible for authoring topics that may need editing or review. 

1) Sort on "Responsible" to see if you have any topics assigned to you.  If your status is other than Green or there is a reviewer comment, action on your part may be indicated.  When you feel you're done with a topic and wish others to review it, set COMPLETE3 which changes your status to Green in the Review Status.

2) Sort on "Status" to see topics that are Green, but have not been reviewed.  These are completed topics in the opinion of the principal author(s), and need to be reviewed.  Anyone can review these, indicating this by adding at the bottom, for example

%REVIEW% Main.MyTwikiName - 09 Nov 2007 %BR%
%REVCOM% Looks good, fixed some typos

(you can leave the REVCOM blank which means you've reviewed the topic and think its okay as is.)

Or, for example a topic that needs work:

%REVIEW% Main.MyTwikiName - 09 Nov 2007 %BR%
%REVCOM% Needs updating

in this case you may change the COMPLETE3 directive to COMPLETE2 which would draw the attention of the principal author(s).  Please do feel welcomed to jump in and review the documents and fix/provide feedback as the case may be - the OSG community as a whole will surely benefit.

3) Finally, remember to check back from time to time during the next week and half as your topics may have been reviewed, new topics assigned, etc.
