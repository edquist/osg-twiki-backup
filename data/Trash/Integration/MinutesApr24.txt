   * Previous meetings, MinutesApr17


---++ WS Gram testing diagram (Martin)
   * See attachment
   * osp2.lbl.gov cannot submit to any site.
   * Client-side condor logs indicate stage-in problem between t2dev and osg-itb.ligo. Would like to see container logs.
   * David will send logfiles from osg-itb.ligo.
   * Container size - is it 1G or 512MB?  Max thread count?  (Need to circulate this for each server.)
   * Condor G submit from t2dev - to t2dev, Martin's test worked fine.  Suchandra notes there is a parameter that limits condor-g to submit less than 50 jobs.  When it is 1K, it fails quickly.  The parameter is "submitted jobs per resource".   
   * Stu: need to be explicit about our condor settings, server-side settings for each site.  Jeff will set this up.

---++ WS Gram (Jeff)
   * Suchandra said he has put together some scripts to set up various scaling tests with data movement.
   * I also have a simple script for that purpose as well, building condor-g submit files.
   * David has the ligo production set ready to roll
   * Stu was interested in non-condor-g approaches (e.g. SWIFT)

From my view, it would be good to understand what those scripts invoke from gt4 wrt good practices.  That is, we seem to run into problems under some data transfer conditions though those occurances appear recoverable and perhaps could be avoided altogether.  I'd like to understand that space a little better.

---++ Syslog-ng

On a different topic, David had suggested that we discuss the vtb deployment of syslog-ng at tomorrow's meeting.
   * Decide to do something quick and dirty for the near term.
   * Suchandra will circulate a setup for three hosts.
   * David will install on the ligo site.
