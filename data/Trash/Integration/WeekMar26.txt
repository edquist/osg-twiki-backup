 OSG attributes - Feedback on previous discussion

   * John R and Ted are still examining storage attributes issues related to SRM support.
   * Burt recommended phase 2 efforts focused on EGEE/LCG interoperability issues raised by attributes. Example MaxWallTime? semantics. 

WS Gram testing update

   * Suchandra: completed 1000 trivial jobs submitted in two hours. Developing a script that mines Condor-G log file for useful stats related to job run-time. If you want the script email him.
   * Jeff: determined that by setting queue=120 before ws-gram job submission, He was able to repeatedly stop the ws-gram service on LIGO-CIT-ITB. Globus engineers have the log files and are examining this behavior.
   * David has configured the Pegasus planner to generate ws-gram Condor-G submit scripts for the nanoHIPE LIGO app used for validation on the ITB. He has successfully executed that resulting workflow on the following CEs: LIGO-CIT-ITB, OSG_LIGO_PSU and TTU-TESTWULF. Approximately 300 jobs are created that move gravitational-wave files to the CE and perform an inspirial search for gravitational-wave radiation from two black holes merging. All jobs completed on all three CEs. 

Storage on the ITB

   * State of SRM/dcache at UChicago: Suchandra reports approximately 140 GB of storage available and the SE is available for testing.
   * State of SRM/dcache at BNL: Xin reports approximately 50 GB of storage available and the SE is available for testing. Most VOs not yet authorized but Xin will configure those soon.
   * Ted outlined future plans including administration tools for space reservation, adding & removing pools, replica management and data quality measurement. 

Fix for configure_prima_gt4 script overwriting existing config file.

   * John has tested a patch to solve this problem and the patch will be available via the VDT soon.
   * John noted that there is a directory created during the VDT installation vdt/backup which contains backups of any files that vdt changes. 

Gratia-LSF-Probe problem

   * Alan noted that he and Horst have inconsistent results related to a lock file that is not allowing the gratia-lsf-probe to start. Alain R has sent out a notice of an update to fix this problem via email. Alan to try the update. 

SRM/DRM integration with Glue schema

   * Alan noted the difficulty of integrating the Glue schema with DRM. As no one from the VDT team was present we need to determine if this is within the scope of future work by the VDT team.
