   * [[Integration/ITB_0_7/DocumentationTable][Doc table]] split into pieces
   * Topics split into separate docs with includes
   * Concatenation docs made for "about release", "prepare to install", and "install CE"
   * maybe need ones for "post-install CE" and "install SE"?
   * overview doc updated but needs more work
   * I need guidance on category "where do these go"

   * Google custom search added to left bar for main and Documentation; I don't have access to ReleaseDocumentation/WebLeftBar
   * I need to remove it on various indiv pages in itb07 area

   * [[Documentation/WebHome][Doc hub]] updated (point to itb07 for testing, will be fixed to point to rel doc)
   * [[Documentation/AdminDocHub][resource/service provider doc hub]] updated
      * I'd like a site admin to look through these and give feedback
   * Charles B is assigned to work on consolidating troubleshooting info
   * OSG website menu structure changed for leading people to doc

Questions
   * what conf calls and meetings should a site admin attend (regularly or occasionally)?  (integ, troubleshoot, ...?
   * what are recommened lists to belong to?  Need review/update of [[Documentation/MailingListsSubscribe]]
   * same question for a voms admin
   * do we want to point to any doc on how to set up a cluster?
   * Is there a DiscoveryServiceInstallation doc?  (a pointer is in the ceinstallguide)
   * Edu web has some general answers to (user) questions: how to start, monitor, cancel, get results from a job? [[Documentation/EndUserDocHub#Using_the_Grid]].  Are these right for 080? (globusrun-ws -submit ..., globus-job-run..., condor_submit..., condor_submit_dag...).  How to handle?
