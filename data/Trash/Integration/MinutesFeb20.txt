---++ Survey
   * See SiteValidationTableITB052
   * David notes that almost all sites have updated with the latest release - and David has made checks of sites. 
   * Problems with GROW (had planned on updating), BNL (Xin), FNAL (Steve).  Some problems supporting the LIGO VO.
   * TTU: have found LSF problem, but has not checked PBS problem.

---++ Alan Sill's reported problems
   * LSF problem - hangs on submission for a WS-Gram, a softenv variable.
   * PBS problem - pre-WS submit, get another error - "cannot send environment with the job".  But, there is no problem when its WS submissions.
   * Suchandra notes that on his VTB submission - has not seen any problems.  Is it a Torque vs PBSpro problem?
   * Alain - will work with Alan to debug - and to see what changes are needed for the LSF.

---++ CEMon sensor problem
   * https://rt-racf.bnl.gov/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=1738, http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=2449
   * John is finding an index out of range problem, so ldiff files are not being created.
   * If you restart, it stays around for a couple of days; happened in about 5 days.
   * Note this is on a Xen host, with a small amount of memory.  
   * No other feedback from ITB.
   * John detects it by the exception in =catalina.out= file. 
   * John will send out request to ITB to check this.
   * Does not sound update related.

---++ VDT update problems
   * Alan's previously reported problems have been fixed in the release.
   * Some sites have done clean installs, others updates.
   * Current set of issues probably not related to the update mechanism.

---++ SRM dCache 1.7.1 issues
   * Suchandra testing.  Summary of UC issues: everything except srmcp cannot work. Working the issue with the dcache group at fermilab.  Bug reports submitted - eg., java 1.6 not detected correctly, a couple of syntax errors in the bash script.  
   * Note - the dCache installation is distinct from the rest of the VDT.
   * BNL site: to join this week.

---++ SRM DRM SE
   * Alan Sill testing.  No news in about a week.  Did get it to work. Starting from VDT 1.6.0.  Many fixes, but the SRM-DRM team needed to manually intervene.
   * Alain will get in touch with Alex on changes to make.
   * Platform: CentOS4. 
   * A number of configuration questions - with regard to OSG attributes.  Not sure what to respond in some cases, eg., "path". 

---++ WS Gram testing
   * Jeff reports: _I'm setting up for the condor-g tests for ws-gram and will email out results.  I did test whether those sites that were configured for batch submission remain so after the update;  we have 3 condor and 1 pbs sites available since the update.   The sample is larger under 'fork' submission._

---++ Gridscan
   * More work on SRM tester.
   * Looking for the best srmcp - use the one in VDT-Client (v1.25).  Timor: srm v1; Alex Sim: srm v2.

---++ Documentation 
   * Rob Q will ping the group again.

---++ Endgame/Showstoppers
   * Need to address the PBSpro issue, and the LSF issue.  Other than that, basically no other known showstoppers before calling this the OSG 0.6 release.
