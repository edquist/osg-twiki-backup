---++ Introduction


 *Integration Objectives and Scope* This OSG Consortium Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, establishes a framework for releases, and coordinates the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB). This include work in the Interoperability.WebHome between OSG and EGEE.

*OSG Integration Project* The OSG IntegrationProject delivers the core ValidationTestbed (VTB) for first pass systems-level integration and validation of VDT services and tools. The porgram of work and effort reports are described in IntegrationProject.

*OSG Sites Coordination* has been organized to help OSG site administrators with their deployments. See: SiteCoordination.WebHome.

---++ ITB Releases
 NewOSGServices describes the process for integrating new services into the OSG. An ITB release is defined as a set of services provided by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), VO-specific services provided by that VO, such as a VOMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB. Client packages and libraries for use with an ITB release are provided by VDT releases - either the VDT Client distribution or sub-sets as needed by the client application or user.
