---++Introduction
---+++!! Integration Objectives and Scope
This OSG Consortium Activity integrates the middleware services, develops processes for and performs validation and certification in advance of OSG deployments, devises best practices for configuration management, establishes a framework for releases, and coordinates the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB).

---+++!! OSG Integration Project
The OSG IntegrationProject delivers the core ValidationTestbed (VTB) for first pass systems-level integration and validation of VDT services and tools.

---+++!! Call for Contributions
The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG integration activities. It is a resource available to, and editable by, all OSG users (if you're new, register at TWiki.TWikiRegistration; Main.KyleGross or Main.RobQ will then have to add you to the
[[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GridGroup][GridGroup]] to allow write access. To edit content, click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of any page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) TWiki.WikiWord. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new TWiki.WikiWord (also known as a 'topic').
_Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using TWiki.GoodStyle of course)!_

---++ ITB Releases
NewOSGServices describes the process for integrating new services into the OSG.   An ITB release is defined as a set of services provided by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), a _VO_ (VO specific services provided by that VO, such as a VOMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB.  Client packages and libraries for use with an ITB release are provided by VDT releases - either the VDT Client distribution or sub-sets as needed by the client application or user.
Here we describe the integration testbed releases and point to installation instructions.  An ITB release is defined as a set of functionalities that are provided by a _site_ (gatekeeper services running on a computing element), a _VO_ (VO specific services provided by that VO, such as a VOMS server), or another _resource provider_, such as group providing a monitoring or discovery service that may be used in the context of the ITB.  Client packages and libraries for use with an ITB release are provided by VDT releases - either the VDT Client distribution or sub-sets as needed by the client application or user.
