The following was submitted from Alain Roy:


Lightning talks are unusual, and a bit unfamiliar to many in our community. Unlike many talks that we give, lightning talks are NOT meant to provide all possible details on a subject. Instead, they are meant to whet the appetites of your listeners and encourage them to learn more.

Let's be honest: if someone drones on for a thirty minute talk--even if they are a good speaker--you're often lucky if you remember one or two main points a week after the talk. A lightning talk will limit itself to the main points and provide a way for interested listeners to learn more.

The goal of a lightning talk is two-fold:
   * Make a point that can stick in someone's head
   * Generate discussions that can be held later

This will require you to write your talk differently than you are used to. Think hard about what you want to communicate. What is the essence of your message? What do you want people to remember? Do you understand your topic well enough that you can distill it into a short message that people can understand?

Rules:

   1) Lighting talks will be limited to five minutes, including Q&A. NO LONGER.
   2) You are allowed to use !PowerPoint, but time spent on technical difficulties will contribute to your five minutes. You won't get through more than 3-5 slides.
