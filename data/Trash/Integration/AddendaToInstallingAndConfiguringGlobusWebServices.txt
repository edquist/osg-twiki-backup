   * Since the release of OSG 0.6.0, a team on the VTB has been testing the ws-gram interface with workloads and workflows.
   * The following procedure will increase the robustness of the ws-gram software stack as deployed in 0.6.0:
      * As root, shutdown the ws-gram stack for reconfiguration:  vdt-control --off globus-ws
      * Increase the Java container parameter containerThreadsMax from the default value="20" to value="100"
         * The containerThreadsMax parameter is located in the file: $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_core/server-config.wsdd
      * Increase the maximum amount of memory allocated to the Java container to 1024 MB. Set GLOBUS_OPTIONS="-Xmx1024M"
         * The GLOBUS_OPTIONS parameter is located in the file: $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
      * Restart the ws-gram stack: vdt-control --on globus-ws
