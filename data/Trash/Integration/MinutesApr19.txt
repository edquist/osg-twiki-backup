---++Introduction
Minutes of the Integration meeting, April 19, 2007
   * Last week: MinutesApr12;  Tuesday's meeting: MinutesApr17.
   * Previous meetings: MeetingMinutes
   * ITB list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-int.html][archive]]
   * VTB list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-vtb.html][archive]]
   * Coordinates: 2:30pm Central, 1-510-665-5437 #1212

---++ Attending   
   * Previous Attendees: Rob, Alan, David, Stu, Martin, Burt, Rob, John R, John W, Horst, Suchandra, Jeff,  Steve T, Brian, Shaowen, Anand, Michael(LTU) , Alain, Chris
   * Attendees:  David, Tim Cartwright, 
   * Apologies: Rob G.

---++ VDT Update:
   * Tim Cartwright will provide an update based on the latest VDT release and proposals.

---++ WS Gram updates
   * Martin Feller has found that changing the containerThreadsMax value from 20 to 100 in file $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_core/server-config.wsdd may prevent ws-globus from crashing under high loads. 
   * Preliminary test on LIGO-CIT-ITB with containerThreadsMax by Jeff has not been able to bring down the ws-globus. More testing on a wider range of clusters needed.
   * Scalability tests will be undertaken after ws-globus stability is assured.

---++ Syslog-ng
   * Suchandra's documentation for recommendation for VTB sites ?
   * Status of central repository for logging: Ready for VTB logs ?


---++ SRM testing
   * John Rosheck is working on SRM/Attributes interoperability: http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Attributes Final Report
   * Anand report on any further feedback? 

---++ Request for Comment from Burt (Not able to attend this meeting)
   * Currently, we export the gatekeeper's value of GLOBUS_LOCATION to the worker node environment.  This is in principle because globus sets this variable (one can provide it in the globus RSL), and it overrides any value in osg-job-environment.conf.
   * For example: if I've installed my gatekeeper at /osg/ce, but the worker-node client at /osglocal/wn, the jobs in the batch jobmanager have the following attributes: OSG_GRID = /osglocal/wn GLOBUS_LOCATION = /osg/ce/globus
   * In many installs, the gatekeeper software is not necessarily exported to the workers, so that GLOBUS_LOCATION will not be accessible.
   * I propose we consider adopting the solution from the NFS lite patches, namely to change the batch jobmanagers to set GLOBUS_LOCATION = ${OSG_GRID}/globus
   * This affects interoperability at some level -- LCG 2.7 and gLite 3.0 expect to find this (although gLite 3.0 wants other things as well). gLite 3.1 should jump to OSG_GRID and run setup.sh, but that's not yet in production.

---++ Any Other Business
