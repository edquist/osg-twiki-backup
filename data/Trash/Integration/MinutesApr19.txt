---++ WS Gram updates
   * Martin Feller has found that changing the containerThreadsMax value from 20 to 100 in file $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_core/server-config.wsdd may prevent ws-globus from crashing under high loads. 
   * Preliminary test on LIGO-CIT-ITB with containerThreadsMax by Jeff has not been able to bring down the ws-globus. More testing on a wider range of clusters needed.
   * Scalability tests will be undertaken after ws-globus stability is assured.
