---++Introduction
Minutes of the Trash/Integration meeting, April 19, 2007
   * Last week: MinutesApr12;  Tuesday's meeting: MinutesApr17.
   * Previous meetings: MeetingMinutes
   * ITB list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-int.html][archive]]
   * VTB list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-vtb.html][archive]]
   * Coordinates: 2:30pm Central, 1-510-665-5437 #1212

---++ Attending   
   * Attendees:  David, Tim Cartwright, Anand, Horst, Jeff, Karthik, Martin Feller, Michael, Stu Martin, John R, John W, Tanya
   * Apologies: Rob G, Burt

---++ VDT Update:
   * Tim Cartwright provided an update based on the latest VDT release and proposals.  Recommened an upgrade of VOMS that is now supported to prevent an incompatability with future VOMS services being rolled out.
   * Progress continues on a newer version of VOMS that recently built on x86_64 but not yet on AIX or RHE5. The newer version of VOMS wil go into VDT 1.70 cache but is not yet tested.
   * Tim warned to be careful to read the installation notes when performing the recent edg-mkgridmap upgrade as one needs to move the config file prior to making the upgrade.
   * John W informed us that there is a new format that needs to be supported for compatability with gums-config and gums-host-cron. This is an action item for Rob Quick to resolve.

---++ WS Gram updates
   * Martin Feller has found that changing the containerThreadsMax value from 20 to 100 in file $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_wsrf_core/server-config.wsdd may prevent ws-globus from crashing under high loads. 
   * Preliminary test on LIGO-CIT-ITB with containerThreadsMax by Jeff has not been able to bring down the ws-globus. More testing on a wider range of clusters needed.
   * Scalability tests will be undertaken after ws-globus stability is assured.

---++ Syslog-ng
   * Suchandra will document the installation procedure for syslog-ng for David (LIGO) and Jeff(NERSC) before the next VTB meeting April 24.
   * Status of central repository for logging: Daemons for running the repo not yet started.
   * Tanya asked about the use of Syslog-ng activities and Brian Tierney at LBNL was mentioned as the Project Lead on this activity.


---++ SRM testing
   * John Rosheck is working on SRM/Attributes interoperability: http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/
   * John reported that there are still issues related to determining the end point for SRM including the port number used by a site.
   * John worked with Michael Thomas on the CIT_CMS_T2 SRM. Michael pointed out that additional capabilities are needed for overwriting the Glue schema as he had to remove a Glue attribute to properly configure glue for SRM.  Overwriting the existing glue attribute was not sufficient. Perhaps this should be part of the next work package that Anand and the Glue attributes folks can add to the list of deliverables.

---++ Attributes Final Report
   * Anand reported work is complete related to Glue Schema 1.2
   * Next activity will be based on Glue Schema 1.3
   * Burt is the point of contact for LCG compatability work requirements for the Glue Schema.

---++ Request for Comment from Burt (Not able to attend this meeting)
   * Currently, we export the gatekeeper's value of GLOBUS_LOCATION to the worker node environment.  This is in principle because globus sets this variable (one can provide it in the globus RSL), and it overrides any value in osg-job-environment.conf.
   * For example: if I've installed my gatekeeper at /osg/ce, but the worker-node client at /osglocal/wn, the jobs in the batch jobmanager have the following attributes: OSG_GRID = /osglocal/wn GLOBUS_LOCATION = /osg/ce/globus
   * In many installs, the gatekeeper software is not necessarily exported to the workers, so that GLOBUS_LOCATION will not be accessible.
   * Burt proposes we consider adopting the solution from the NFS lite patches, namely to change the batch jobmanagers to set GLOBUS_LOCATION = ${OSG_GRID}/globus
   * This affects interoperability at some level -- LCG 2.7 and gLite 3.0 expect to find this (although gLite 3.0 wants other things as well). gLite 3.1 should jump to OSG_GRID and run setup.sh, but that's not yet in production.
   * Michael has succesfully used this technique on the cluster he administers at CIT.
