---++ Auto-update testing 
   * *last week*:
      * Iwona - ran update backup scripts; will test client updates.
      * Manual updates - running the pacman commands one-by-one.
      * Steve and Suchandra are testing both
      * Robert will do the manual update.
      * Xin - is trying the automatic script.
      * No instructions sent on how to update the SE.  *Suchandra will check with Tim C, and will send out an email.*
      * Gratia probe update tested and worked.
      * RSV testing - Iwona 
   * *this week*:
      * Finished, declare it a success. 
      * Robert - pacman update didn't work (everything looked good, but GRAM hangs). Will try again today.  The process is convoluted.  
      * No known issues with the vdt updater script.
      * Need a page for update directions and guidance.


---++ SE validation table
   * *last week*:
      * Need to make client testing explicit.
   * *this week*:
      * Main thing is that Gratia probes and dCache probes were not tested.



---++ configure-osg.sh (Suchandra)
   * *last week*:
      * Suchandra needs to test patch
      * Send notification to osg-int
   * *this week*:
      * Implemented everything requested.  Tested on UC_ITB - worked.  John W is also testing.
      * Otherwise no known issues.

   
---++ GUMS template testing in the ITB (Suchandra)
   * *last week*:
      * Make ITB package
      * Test that it works
      * Send notification to osg-int.
   * *this week*:
      * Done


---++ Documentation (Keith)
   * *last week*
      * Gather minor things that need documenting
      * Will post to issues to RT
   * *this week:*
      * Have gone through and entered all the issues pertinent to the release.
      * Alex is still working on Bestman docs.

   * *this week*:


---++ Campfire
   * Schedule set for this week - sign up.



---++ AOB
   * Suchandra - doing last minute coordinations regarding the release.
   * Iwona - will be installing new CE and client, wn-client - testing it all.  Then SE, when available. Thursday campfire.  Will look into RSV probe issue.  (Why did  Peter D have more probes in his installation?)  Being able to trigger RSV probes by hand.   (Its a doc issue.) 
   * Robert - bring CE back to the installation before the upgrade;  Try upgrade procedure again.  Summarize and send to list.  After Wednesday, update CE and client software to see if everything still works.  Cannot change SE since its being used by LIGO.  Provide a document for moving data into and out of the SE.   A parallel filesystems how-to would be nice.  (Eg. Hadoop, GFS, etc, w/ regard to warning.)
   * Keith - documentation, documentation, documentation; Wednesday campfire.  Will start looking at docs as soon as Kyle cuts it.
