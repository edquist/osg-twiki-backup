   * Client tools validation - need 
   * Squid not getting tested currently - need a volunteer.
   * Storage testing: =srm-tester= is used automatically, all one has to do is register the SE.   The current test uses Alex Sim's DN.
   * Grid monitor does not seem to work at OU, osg-itb1, and the Gridexerciser causes problems.  *Has anyone noticed that the Grid-monitor is not working?*
   * Need to udpate ValWSGram.

---++ Status and issues of core sites
   * FNAL - Neha: has had problems with WS Gram.  sudoers file not configured correctly (error code 200). Suchandra advises a file =sudosetup= in the monitoring directory, and then copy to sudoers

   * UC - just re-installed with latest ITB, currently configuring, will run through tests.
   * CIT - working on validation - see table; will reinstall again.  Noticing file transfer failing using, gsi, working w/ Ted.

---++ RSV
   * See ReleaseDocumentation.ValidateRSV-Infrastructure and ReleaseDocumentation.ValidateRSV-Probes
   * !RobQ has reviewed the instructions for install and config.   Should RSV be run inside osg-configure?  10 probes, 15 metrics - may want to keep this outside the configure osg script.  Suggestion is to start with sensible defaults.  Need to answer questions about username and certificate to use.
