---++Introduction
Minutes of the Integration meeting, October 26, 2006
   * Last meeting: MinutesOct19
   * Previous meetings: MeetingMinutes
   * Coordinates: 2:30pm Central, 1-510-665-5437 #1212

---++Attending
   * David Meyers, Rob Gardner, Gabriele, Illya, Alan Sill, Forrest, Steve, Rob Quick, Terrence, GROW, Karthik, Doug, Alain, Burt, Michael Thomas, Leigh, John W, 

---++ Agenda
   * NFSLiteIntegration
   * DocumentationBestPractices
   * ITB 0.5.1, [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi?region=0&VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo=0&res=0&grid=4][VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS]]  [[http://osg-itb.ivdgl.org/gridcat/][Grid Cat]]
   * Fix required for cron job that creates grid-mapfile (Horst reported this).
   * Steve Timm's observations from last week: MinutesOct19
   * AOB

---++ NFS Lite
   * How to support the initial remote directory specification from Condor G.
   * What to implement?  Depends on what VOs expect, want.
   * LIGO is currently is using the Pegasus planner - they do set the initial remote directory.  Need that capability.
   * GADU may have the same requirements as they are using Pegasus.
   * Other batch systems don't understand grid proxies, but Condor does.
   * Alain - Condor creates its own directory (random).
   * Terrence wants to know how to handle this in a general case.  If remote-dir is set, can we assume the user knows what he is doing?  Check by VO.
   * Leigh raises the question about whether this solution is optimal.
   * Should Condor support initial-dir specification?  Alain will raise this with Miron.
   * How does operations and app developers know which sites run NFS lite? Suggestion to liaise with monitoring TG to publish through the glue schema.
   * Terrence will finalize the NFSLite patch/configuration proposal within a week - and then there will be testing period on sites in the ITB.
   * Timeline for VDT 1.6 would be less than a month.  (target date is December 16)

---++ Documentation
   * Can everyone reviewu this page.  Main issue is use of INCLUDE directives, and re-use of common topics.
   * Where-used feature added.

---++ ITB 0.5.1 issues
   * Several sites showing Green in grid cat.
   * LIGO will be running some validation tests on sites with enough disk.
   * Fermilab is validating with Keith's scripts (FNAL VO)
   * CMS is in the middle of a SC.
   * ATLAS will be validating.

---++ Followup from last week 
   * Steve has sent out mail to discuss GIP input options.  Committee - Marco, Rob Q, Anand, Shaowen.
   * Documentation is ambiguous about how to handle certs.
   * Other issues have been resolved.
   * Test GIP declaration of SE, SRM interface.  There are 6TB of storage available.  Ligo will work on this with Steve.

---++ AOB
   * None
