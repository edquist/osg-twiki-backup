---++ Introduction
   * Attending: Steve, Valerie Sergeiev/Fermigrid, Suchandra, Marco, Horst, Shaowen, Anand, David, John Urish, Rob
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, March 13, 2007; 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #2222


---++ Purpose
   * Ensure the presently published OSG attributes are well understood and documented.
   * Identify subset of neccessary attributes that *must* be advertised that othwerwise would generate a trouble ticket, ensuring integrity of the OSG environment.
   * Identify user tools and pointers to documentation sufficient to meet the needs of VOs - i.e. customers of the information.
   * Identify advanced methods needed and potential next steps for publishing more complicated cluster and storage configurations.

---++ Notes
   * Anand has documented the procedure for setting GlueHostNetworkAdapter{Inbound,Outbound}IP attributes and overwriting other site-specific attributes in general.
      * Details at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/GenericInformationProviders#Overwriting_attributes_published

---++ WLCG Interoperability
   * See a piece of output of the ldap query, =ldapsearch -xLLL -h exp-bdii.cern.ch -p 2170 -b o=grid  > /tmp/out=, LdapQueryLCG
   * See a piece of output of the ldap query, =ldapsearch -x -l 60 -b mds-vo-name=TTU-ANTAEUS,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid -h is.grid.iu.edu -p 2170=, LdapQueryOSG
   * Anand thinks this is mostly there right now.  Rob Q thinks its an issue of sites not yet reporting to the OSG BDII.
   * Anand has identified attributes used by the RB, and have checked.
   * Steve believes the issue may be that we need to add an attribute. 
   * For OSG 0.6.0, we are sticking with Glue 1.2.  This Steve believes will be a limitation. 
   * Anand says there are two parts to this: writing the plugins, and changing schema.
   * One issue is whether LCG would see duplicate information.

---++ Top level BDII services
   * Note,  =is.grid.iu.edu= is the production OSG BDII.  (The =is.itb.iu.edu= is the ITB instance.)

---++ Publishing valid information
   * See further:
      * $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/ldif
      * Most of the ones in question are in
      * $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/ldif/osg-info-static-cluster.ldif
   * Anand believes that the CE attributes modulo last minute checks.
   * There are some attributes, eg., SE and sub cluster, may require more work.
   * There are five or six categories that need review
      * Site, CE, SE, CE-SE bind, Cluster (Sub Cluster), Service (unused)
      * Class of static attributes that need conventions, critical:
         * Glue cluster name, CPU speed, main memory (per VM), 

---++ Next steps
   * Take one ldiff file at a time, and what is critical, what is static/dynamic.
   * Would like to get input from VOs.
   * Setup a review process.  Subdivide into what is provided, what could be provided in the next release of the Glue schema.
   * Goal is for next tuesday to have first version of a review page, for comment.
   * Once in place, we'll call for review/commentary from OSG-INT, and from the Applications group for VO developer input.
