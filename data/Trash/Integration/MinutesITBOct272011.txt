---++ Persistent ITB Sites (Admins)
---+++ Last Update
   * BNL
      * Trying to run ATLAS jobs using new worker node client
         * Having problems with passing environment variables for rpms due to PATH missing from worker nodes 
         * Jobs get an error regarding LFC being missing
            * Will investigate and then email list
         * Tried to install CE install, but is getting errors with globus-run-job using GT2 
         * Ran into problems due to Globus port ranges not being applied
         * Ran into problems due to documentation being limited
   * FNAL
      * Installed wn-client software 
      * Haven't had problems with gatekeeper but limited testing with this
      * Giving higher priority to wn-client, glexec, and osg-client
   * FNAL - CMS (Tony)
      * All worker nodes setup using wn-client
      * Sent install and configuration to software list
      * Both fermilab sites would like accept_limted support for condor and pbs as well as managed fork 
      * Opened cluster to glide-in wms 
   * OUHEP
   * UC_ITB
      * xrootd cluster being set up
      * CE running on a gatekeeper and RSV probes on gatekeeper being tested
      * Working on getting a PBS CE running and running panda jobs on cluster


---+++ This Week
   * BNL
      * Problems reported at meeting last week were solved, ATLAS jobs were run successfully
      * Still have problems with 32 bit python lfc bindings -- probably won't have fixes for initial wn client but will have done before final release
      * Installing another CE and testing full chain of rpm based installs CE -> worker node 
   * FNAL
      * Not much change
   * FNAL - CMS (Tony)
      * Testing is going pretty well
      * Ran into issues with interoperability testing but these have been fixed
      * Have run a few glidein-wms jobs 
   * OUHEP
   * UC_ITB
      * Still working on getting ATLAS panda jobs running
      * Will put up a xrootd/bestman2 SE up this afternoon 
  
---++ ITB testing of RPMS
   * Sites participating:
      * BNL
      * FNAL
      * FNAL (CMS)
      * TTU
      * OUHEP
      * UC_ITB
      * UNL
      * Wisconson
   * [[Documentation/Release3.InstallWNClient][Basic  install instructions]]
   * [[Documentation.RPMTempDocuments][RPM Documentation]]
   * [[SoftwareTeam.RPMTimeline][RPM Timeline]]
   * Limited availability releases of wn-client, glexec, and osg-client
      * No showstoppers in current testing, looking good for limited availability 
   * glExec
      * Steve had questions in regards to regressions in glexec rpms vs. pacman
         * Alain says that no new regressions are known in current rpm packages
         * glexec scalability delayed but will occur
      * Globus update
         * Shouldn't affect systems, i.e. yum update will apply cleanly 
   * Condor on CE
      * BNL uses condor 7.4, CE install will upgrade the condor to new version
      * Condor on CE isn't affected, clients may see differences between condor and osg rpms
      * Passing through condor rpm in order to have a separate procd rpm
   * NPAD 
      * yum remove npad tried to remove meta package  due to dependencies, can be solved by updating to latest version of the meta package

---++ AOB  
   * Doug requeted SE testing support
      * UC_ITB is testing xrootd/bestman2  will test hdfs/bestman2 when ready
      * Rob Gardner will ask ATLAS sites for testing help
