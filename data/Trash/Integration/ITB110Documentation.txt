---+++ Documentation
Documentation changes should go in the release documentation web.  If the documentation, requires changes that are not compatible with osg 1.0.x, please note that.

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][Release Documentation]]

---+++ Installation 
*You will need to use [[http://atlas.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz][Pacman 3.28]] for installing this ITB release*

<br/>
Procedure for CE:
   * =pacman -get ITB:ce=
   * =pacman -get ITB:Globus-X-Setup= where =X= is your jobmanager
   * =pacman -get ITB:ManagedFork= (optional)
   * =source setup.sh=
   * =vdt-post-install=
   * Run configure-osg (now called =configure-osg=  and located in =osg/bin=). =configure-osg= is now in your path, so you can run it at the command line after sourcing setup.sh
Changes:
   * contents of =monitoring= directory have been moved to =osg/etc= or =osg/bin=

Procedure for wn-client and client is similar except that configure-osg doesn't need to be run

---+++ Testing
Validation will be documented at [[OSG12Validation]]

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
Tickets can also be filed by emailing osg_itb@tick.globalnoc.iu.edu
