---+++ Documentation
Documentation changes should go in the release documentation web.  If the documentation, requires changes that are not compatible with osg 1.0.x, please note that.

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][Release Documentation]]

---+++ Installation 
*You will need to use [[http://atlas.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz][Pacman 3.28]] for installing this ITB release*

The VDT release notes for VDT 2.0.0 can be found here: [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release.html][http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release.html]].

There are a couple significant changes with the VDT 2.0.0 pacman installations.
   * VDT disregards pre-answered questions
   * There will be no questions asked other than asking if you agree to the license agreement.
   * After installing from a cache, you will need to run the =$VDT_LOCATION/bin/vdt-post-install= script
   * All services will be "disabled".  For a CE node, the =configure-osg= script will do the enabling.  For all other installs, the individual services must be enabled using the =vdt-control= script individually.

The deltas to the existing installation instructions are noted in the sections that follow.

---++++ CA Certificates
A new tool, =vdt-ca-manage= , replaces the manual editing of the configuration file and use of the =vdt-setup-ca-certificates=  script.  See [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html#installing][http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html#installing]] for details.

---++++ Compute Element (CE)
Changes:
   1 The contents of =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring= directory have been separated:
      * configuration files are in =osg/etc= 
      * executables/libraries are in =osg/bin=
   1 The =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring= directory is symlinked to =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc=  for backward compatibility. 
   1 The executables in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin= will be in your =$PATH= after your source the =$VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh= script
   1 The =configure-osg.py= script has been renamed as =configure-osg=

Procedure for CE:
   * =pacman -get ITB:ce=
   * =pacman -get ITB:Globus-X-Setup= where =X= is your jobmanager
   * =pacman -get ITB:ManagedFork= (optional)
   * =source setup.sh=
   * =vdt-post-install=
   * Manually change your =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file for the services and attributes desired.
   * Run =configure-osg= 
   * Verify all services are enabled using =vdt-control -list= 

*Note:* Currently, the configuration for the authorization mode (gridmap/PRIMA) is not handled by the =configure-osg= script.  So enabling/configuration of those services must still be performed manually.

---++++ CLIENT

---++++ WN-CLIENT
The only changes for a WN-CLIENT installation are:
   1 Run the =vdt-post-install= after the =pacman -get= is complete.
   1 Then enable the desired services using =vdt-control --enable &lt;service&gt;=
      * fetch-crl
      * vdt-rotate-logs
      * vdt-update-certs
      * myproxy-server (optional)

---++++ GUMS
The only changes for a GUMS installation are:
   1 Run the =vdt-post-install= after the =pacman -get= is complete.
   1 Then enable the following services using =vdt-control --enable &lt;service&gt;=
      * fetch-crl
      * vdt-rotate-logs
      * vdt-update-certs
      * apache
      * tomcat-55
      * mysql5


---++++ VOMS
The only changes for a VOMS installation are:
   1 Run the =vdt-post-install= after the =pacman -get= is complete.
   1 Then enable the following services using =vdt-control --enable &lt;service&gt;=
      * fetch-crl
      * vdt-rotate-logs
      * vdt-update-certs
      * apache
      * tomcat-55
      * mysql5
      * voms

---+++ Testing
Validation will be documented at [[OSG12Validation]]

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
Tickets can also be filed by emailing osg_itb@tick.globalnoc.iu.edu
