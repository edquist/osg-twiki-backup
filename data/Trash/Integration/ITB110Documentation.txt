---+++ Introduction
This page gives an introduction to the ITB 1.1.0 testing cycle and notes for itb admins. 

---+++ Schedule
The schedule for this integration cycle is available [[SoftwareTools.OSG12Plan][here]].

---+++ Documentation
Documentation changes should go in the release documentation web.  If the documentation, requires changes that are not compatible with osg 1.0.x, please note that.

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][Release Documentation]]

However, note that there are a few differences noted below that are not yet in the Release Documentation.  These changes will be moved to the release documentation as this cycle progresses.

Changes to the release documentation that are OSG 1.2 specific should have a *%<nop>STARTOSG12%* and *%<nop>ENDOSG12%* around the content so that it is indicated as being OSG 1.2 specific in the release documentation. 

---+++ Installation 
%NOTE% The installation instructions are now in the [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][Release Documentation]].  You should refer to that for installation instructions and correct the page or open a footprints ticket if the Release Documentation needs updates. Off course ITB installation should refer to ITB cache whenever the documentation refers OSG cache(e.g. ITB:ce instead of OSG:ce)


---+++ Testing and Validation
Validation instructions and results should be documented at [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationSiteValidationOSG12][OSG12Validation]]

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds
As of the ITB 1.1.4, there's a known bug with =configure-osg=.  On systems with python 2.4 or above, enabling managed fork results in an error when managed fork is enabled.  In order to workaround this bug, disable managed fork in config.ini.  You can then enable managed fork manually by running =configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork y= and then =vdt-control --enable condor=.

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*

---+++ Updating to ITB 1.1.6

In order to update an existing ITB installation you will need to:

   * Update using the vdt-update ( http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/vdt-updater-instructions.html )
   * backup your osg/etc/config.ini file
   * pacman -update osg-config
   * pacman -update vo-package or pacman -update vo-client if you have either packages installed
   * pacman -update osg-version
   * Restore your config.ini and run configure-osg 
   * vdt-control --on
