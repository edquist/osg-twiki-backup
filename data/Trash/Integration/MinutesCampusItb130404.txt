<!--
- Recruitment of early testers, starting with Integration community but open to others
- Providing testers with precise instructions most useful to the BOSCO development team
- Defining specific tests for various platforms and modes

        > single user versus multi-user
        > platforms
        > target clusters
        > required functional testing
        > scale testing
        > operational issues, monitoring

- Collection of feedback
- Tracking issues and bringing to bosco development group
