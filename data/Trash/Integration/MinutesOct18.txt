   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes 
   * ITB 0.7 background
      * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
      * ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable

---++ Status of ITB 0.7.1 (Suchandra) 
   * Packages and cache - any changes needed?
      * follow-up *potential bug in the configuration of the certs updater (Suchandra and Terrence are investigating)*
         * Working now at UC_ITB, also for Terrence. Perhaps a transient error.
         * Will be putting in a change to configure-osg for glexec and configure squid. By Monday.  Suchandra will test for these changes, and John W will.
      * Freezed date is now Oct 23
   * VDT update to VDT 1.8.1b.  Patch to Globus that fixes minor problems; several security fixes (Java, Tomcat, Voms Admin).  Will do a VTB round before.
   * *Sites:*
   * FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB
      * Follow-up: *Encountering problem with gip and pbs  (see VDT ticket 2959 )* Fixed (will be in the update) Y%
      * D0 succeeded on Fermigrid
   * BNL_ITB_Test1   
      * CMS failed w/ srmcp.  Xin trying to get track this down (works on WN).
      * iptables fixed.
      * RSV permissions issue - fixed w/ Arvind.
      * Engage - had failed before - they will try again tomorrow.
      * Nanohub is failing as well.  Xin thinks he fixed the problem (enabled).
   * UC_ITB
      * Still working with Britta @ LIGO - Pegasus worflows not working.  
      * GIP validator - default SE a requirement?  *Need to consult w/ Burt.*
   * CIT_ITB_1
      * Engage had failed, but probably have since succeeded.
   * TTU-TESTWULF
      * No updates, no recent complaints, all appears okay.
   * UCSDT2-ITB1
      * Waiting for Engage, D0; LIGO seems to be working.
      * Follow-up: *Saw problems with cert updater*  Resolved - was an ordering problem in the documentation for privilege sites.

---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo validation (Abhishek)
   * Follow-up: *Engage problems on a few sites (UCSD, CIT -- both responded, waiting on BNL)*, other sites were run successfully
   * Starting tomorrow - will start putting in green flags on validated sites, and start wrapping up the validation.
   * D0SAR tried on OUHEP - their tests were successful.

---++ Report from attributes meeting (Suchandra, Gabriele, Anand)
   * See minutes at MinutesVTBOct16
   * Need to get more experience in production use to better define the critical attributes. 
   * Went over ITB sites to check validity of attributes.  Two sites have problems - FNAL_FERMIGRID_TEST (not up to date).  For UCSDT2-ITB1 condor-status not being run since it wasn't a user.    
   * Need to investigate an issue with Class Ad evaluation in the GIP validator.
   * GUMS service entities query, and translation by CEMon to BDII may have a problem.  Is there a problem with the aggregator filtering non-registered ITB sites.  Why does the BDII retaining old information.  
   * GIP configuration issue w/ CEMon 
      * triage config issue to GIP support issues to Will
      * something that can be improved with standard trouble shooting notes to be included in the release documentation


---++ WS-GRAM testing deployment
   * *Follow-up on these issues*
   * VOs willing to run workflows through WS-GRAM (Suchandra, Jeff)
      * STAR 
          * Have been working with Star developers - looks straightforward.  Having problems with production clients at Brookhaven.  Older version of Condor 6.8.4.
          * Firewall problems with the OSG 0.6 client.
      * LIGO
           * Confirmed w/Britta the ability to run Pegasus through WS-Gram  
   * Replicating earlier ws-gram work against ITB sites (Jeff)
      * started this work last week.
      * Half the sites are working fine, the other are having small problems.
   * Core container issues that Gram relies on - Charles w
   * Does Gratia work correctly with WS-Gram if the condor 6.9?  Need to address this.
   * Documentation updated.  


---++ RSV status (Arvind)
   * RSV SAM reporting status update
      * Sample record uploaded from OSG side to SAM. 
      * Efforts ongoing between Arvind and James/David/Piotr to automate process from ITB RSV collector to other end. On our end, we've clarified what needs to be sent and will write code to make it happen; on their side they need to do some code mods to allow data that conforms to the WLCG specs 0.91 (that we'll be sending -- their system is not tweaked fully to comply with the specs yet).
      * Arvind will write a debugging guide for failures seen in the SAM console.
      * From CE point of view, no changes required in advance of OSG 0.8 deployment.
   * Any *follow-up* on the issue:
      * Condor-devel brought in because production condor installations (6.8.x) don't support cron functionality; RSV should use existing condor if user points to the a condor 6.9.x installation; In general case condor should work, but there might be a conflict between ManagedFork and RSV since both use the local universe; Scot Kronenfeld thinks this might not work, but Terrence will try it out on a system to check
         * Terrence reported back to the ITB list that setting certain environment variables before pulling in the OSG-RSV package, as documented in the twiki, worked fine for him. RSV was using his existing 6.9.x condor install following that.
   * Arvind going on vaction next Thursday for three weeks.
      * Will plan to have infrastructure in place for the SAM before
      * Scott Kronefeld will be the point of contact for RSV
   * Xin: at BNL experiencing a problem restarting RSV, not removing stale Condor processes.  Unique installation? Scott investigating.
