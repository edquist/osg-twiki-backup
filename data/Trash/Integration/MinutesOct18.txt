---++ RSV status (Arvind)
   * RSV SAM reporting status update
   * Any *follow-up* on the issue:
      * Condor-devel brought in because production condor installations (6.8.x) don't support cron functionality
      * RSV should use existing condor if user points to the a condor 6.9.x installation 
      * In general case condor should work, but there might be a conflict between ManagedFork and RSV since both use the local universe
      * Scott Kronenfeld thinks this might not work, but Terrence will try it out on a system to check
