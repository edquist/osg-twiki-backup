Instructions for the ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable for each service need to be created so that sites may begin checking off.
   * Need the GIP validator - it has been setup.
   * Suchandra will setup an SVN repository for testing scripts.

   * Need to dig up where that is.
   * You can indicate whether its an ITB site or not.
   * Does it get monitored?

---++ Documentation
   * ReleaseDocumentation.DocumentationTable: do we have a good starting point?
      * for the most part its accurate
      * gaps are: ws-gram config, vdt certificate updater, syslog-ng
   * Pre-install fest editing needed.
   * Consider Anne's proposal,  DocsComm.AnnePre080Sandbox
