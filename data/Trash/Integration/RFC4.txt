---++ Motivation
The proposal is to simplify the config.ini file and settings that admins will need to change in the config.ini.  The settings in the =Installation Locations= section are not needed since the canonical location for these values can be derived from the =VDT_LOCATION= environment variable. Given this, admins don't need to be asked to set these values and removing these settings eliminates the possibility of incorrectly specifying these settings as well as simplifies the config.ini file.

---++ Scope
The config.ini section will be altered by removing the =Installation Locations= section from the config.ini section.  

---++ Effects
Configure-osg will output a warning indicating that this section is deprecated  if it encounters a =Installation Locations= section.  The settings in this section will be ignored and the values from the environment or path to the =configure-osg= binary will be used instead.  The value of =VDT_LOCATION= will be compared with the location of the configure-osg binary and an error will be raised if there's a discrepancy between the two to catch instances where the setup.sh from the wrong OSG installation is still in effect.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.8. 

---++ Current Status
Posted to osg-int for discussion.
