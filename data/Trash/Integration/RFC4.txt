---++ Motivation
The proposal is to simplify the config.ini file and settings that admins will need to change in the config.ini.  The settings in the =Installation Locations= section are not needed since the canonical location for these values can be derived from the =VDT_LOCATION= environment variable. Given this, admins don't need to be asked to set these values and removing these settings eliminates the possibility of incorrectly specifying these settings as well as simplifies the config.ini file.

---++ Scope
The config.ini section will be altered by removing the =Installation Locations= section from the config.ini section.  

---++ Effects / Changes
The Install Locations section will be removed from the default ce template.  Configurations without this section will use values derived from =VDT_LOCATION=.  If the section is present the values defined in the section will be used, however a log message at the =WARNING= level will be issued indicating that this section is not needed for normal resources.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.9. 

---++ Current Status
Approved and planned for OSG 1.2.9.
