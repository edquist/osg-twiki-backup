         * After install, two cron jobs were activated:

            * gratia-probe-gridftp activated
         * They send an email indicating that they are not configured
         * condor rpm depends on globus rpms - due to dynamic linking, vdt rpms are statically linked

         * Had questions about how to configure rsv run times in condor_cron  
   * UC_ITB
      * Two things of note when updating to latest ITB release
        * SEG dependency on torque-server rpm
        * gratia condor probe not reporting -- investigating whether this is due to misconfiguration or bug in gratia probe
