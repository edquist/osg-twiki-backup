   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Trash/Trash/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]]
Bosco documentation is available also in:

---++ BOSCO Testing 
[[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

The three main use cases are:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check Trash/Trash/CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing.

Horst failed the test because the submit host was 32bit and Bosco is not supported. He will look for a 64bit machine and perform some tests before the next meeting using his LSF cluster.

Xin needs to add custo attributes to the jobs sent to his Condor cluster.
This is now documented in https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/BoscoInstall#7_3_Custom_submit_properties
He will use this customization and perform a test before the next meeting.

---++ Feedback to Developers
It would be nice to have support for 32 hosts, specially RHEL5 32bit. And in the current documentation it is not clear that only 64bit machines are supported. (Horst)

---++ Installation support and issue tracking

OSG All Hands meeting is on 3/11. On the Thursday there will be some hans-on sessions including a Bosco one
