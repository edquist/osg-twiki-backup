---++ Introduction
Describes the recommended hardware for a site which can be a small Integration Test Bed site or a small production. From [[Main.StevenTimm][StevenTimm's]] talk on [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=455][Lessons Learned & Best Practices]].

---++ Compute Element head node
   * At least 4GB of RAM. We have 6GB and we still swap.
   * At least 2 CPUs, as fast as you can get.
   * Enough disk to hold the VDT software and logs (~250GB).
   * For small­/medium size cluster, this machine can be an NFS server for home areas, too.
   * For large cluster we strongly recommend getting a separate enterprise-class NFS server for home areas and APP and DATA areas too.
   * The major loads of memory on a CE are the following:
   * Globus-ws container, 700MB
   * CEMon, 450 MB
   * For a condor-based system, one condor_shadow process per job that is running (7MB apiece).
   * See CondorBatchSystemHints for hints on how to move the condor master off of your head node  (this helps out reliability a lot).
   * See PBSBatchSystemHints for how to split the PBS master off of your head node.

---+++Load Limits
   * One example:  system fcdfosg2, 2x3.2GHz Xeon (hyperthreaded) vintage 2005, now 8GB of RAM.   Averages 6000 grid jobs a day, 2050 job slots running simultaneously.  Works ok but sometimes goes up to load of 50 during rapid job submission sequences.


---++ For VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS Support
If you are supporting a VO, use a 2nd machine of with these specifications to be your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.  VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS can be installed on the same machine and the same VDT installation as VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.

---++ GUMS Support
If you are running GUMS, use a 3rd server with these specifications. 

---++ Storage Element node
