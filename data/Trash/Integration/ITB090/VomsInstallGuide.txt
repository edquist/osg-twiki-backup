---+ Introduction

The Virtual Organization Membership Service (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS - https://twiki.cnaf.infn.it/cgi-bin/twiki/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/WebHome) has three main parts: 
   * !MySQL database which is a persistent repository for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership information, 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat.
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server, a daemon process which services the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests.

Also included in the installation is a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS client containing the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> for testing.

Here we describe how to install and configure VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS on your Linux machine. When you install VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS as described here, you get all three parts.  It comes with a test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called VDT. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.

We also describe how to remove a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS if the need arises.
