---++ Validating supported VOs and Unix accounts
There are 3 files created during the execution of the _edg-mkgridmap_ and _gums-host-cron_ scripts that are intended to aid in verifying that you have configured your authorization service for all the VOs you intend to support and, also that all the Unix accounts have been created on your CE node.  This verification/validation can only be determined on each of the CE nodes your authorization service supports.
   * VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt
   * VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-undefined-accounts.txt
   * VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-supported-vos-list.txt

The _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ is a critical component to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome][OSG Accounting Services]] in accurately collecting grid resource usage and metrics by VO.   It is also used by the [[GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Provider (GIP)]] in advertising resource availability on a VO basis.

The _osg-undefined-accounts.txt_ file provides a list of those UNIX accounts that can be assigned by your authorization service, but have not been defined on your CE node.

The _osg-supported-vos-list.txt_ file provides an easy means of determining which VOs your sites will support based on your authorization service.

These files should never be manually modified if either the _edg-mkgridmap_ or _gums-host-cron_ are enabled (both are cron initiated processes).


---++ osg-user-vo-map.txt
The _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file provides the ability to map from a UNIX account (assigned by the CE's authorization service) back to  the grid user's VO subgroup and VO.

<pre class="programlisting">
<b>Example content: (this example will be referred to by the other subsections on this topic)</b>

#voi cdf fermilab  uscms  miniboone usatlas
#VOc CDF FERMILAB CMS FERMILAB USATLAS
cdf cdf
fnalgrid fermilab
uscms124 uscms
uscms132 uscms
minboone miniboone
</pre>
The file is interpreted as follows:
   * The uncommented lines are the mapping of UNIX account (token 1) to VO subgroup (token 2).
   * The mapping from subgroup to VO is performed using the tokens on the _#voi_ and _#VOc_ lines for which there is a one-to-one positional relation:%BR%
       - The _#voi_ lines represent the VO subgroup (currently only used by fermigrid).%BR%
       - The _#VOc_ lines represent the VO

Thus, from the above example, the mappings would result in:
|  __UNIX%BR%Account__  |  __VO%BR%Subgroup__  |  __VO__  |
|  cdf  |  cdf  |  CDF  |
|  fnalgrid  |  fermilab  |  FERMILAB  |
|  uscms124  |  uscms  |  CMS  |
|  uscms132  |  uscms  |  CMS  |
|  minboone  |  miniboone  |  FERMILAB  |

As mentioned earlier, those CE nodes using either the _edg-mkgridmap_ or _gums-host-cron_ cron processes will have the 3 files programmatically maintained based on these lines in the respective configuration files:

__edg-mkgridmap.conf__ %BR%
<pre class="programlisting">
# USER-VO-MAP cdf CDF 
group vomss://voms.cnaf.infn.it:8443/voms/cdf cdf
</pre>%BR%
The _# USER-VO-MAP_ identifies this as a candidate for the _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file%BR%
   * the 3rd token (_cdf_) is the VO subgroup
   * the 4th token (_CDF_) is the VO.
Any uncommented line(s) following the  _# USER-VO-MAP_ line identify the source of the VO membership and account to be assigned
   * the 3rd token (_cdf_) is the UNIX account.


__gums.config__ %BR%
<pre class="programlisting">
&lt;groupToAccountMapping
    name='cdf'    description=''
    accountingVoSubgroup='cdf'  accountingVo='CDF'
    userGroups='cdf'  accountMappers='cdf-mapper'/&gt;
</pre>
The _groupToAccountMapping_ element identifies this as a candidate for the _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file%BR%
   * the  accountingVoSubgroup attribute (_cdf_) is the VO subgroup
   * the  accountingVo attribute (_CDF_) is the VO.
The accountMappers attribute identifies the UNIX account assignment to be used which, is this case, will result in _cdf_ being assigned (the _accountMapper_ is not shown in this example).  The _hostToGroupMapping_ element is also a factor in the GUMS authorization service for a particular CE node (also not shown in this example).

It should be noted that if a group mapping is defined on the GUMS server but the group is currently empty, there will be no entry for that userid and vo in the osg-user-vo-map.txt.  The presence of a username in the osg-user-vo-map.txt as generated by GUMS means that there is at least one DN in the VO that can map to that group.

Additionally, a verification is made to determine if a UNIX account exists for any that can be potentially assigned by the authorization service.  If the UNIX account does not exist, that UNIX account is removed from the _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file since any grid user being assigned that account will never be able to successfully run a job. These discarded UNIX accounts are listed in the [[OsgSupportedVos#osg_undefined_accounts_txt][osg-undefined-accounts.txt file]].

Finally, when all UNIX accounts have been validated, the _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file is re-evaluated to determine the set of OSG VOs  that this CE node will support.  By that, it is meant that at least one VO's member can expect to the authorized and successfully assigned an account that will run for this CE node.  The [[OsgSupportedVos#osg_supported_vos_txt][osg-supported-vos.txt file]] contains this list of VOs.

This _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file's timestamp will only change when the contents of the file changed. To assist in verifying the currency of the file, another file called _osg-user-vo-map.txt.last_checked_ is created ('touched')  each time the processes are run. 



---++ osg-undefined-accounts.txt

This file contains a list of those UNIX accounts that have been eliminated from the _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file because the UNIX account assigned by the authorization service does not exist.  

The test used to determine the UNIX account's existence is 'id -u &lt;account&gt;'.  However, there is __no__ verfication performed  to determine if a HOME directory exists for the account.

This file contains a list of all VOs that this CE node will support.  It does not mean that all members of the these VOs will be able to run jobs here, but that at least one member will be capable.
