---+++ Handling incremental facility upgrades
It is expected the upgrade to OSG 0.6.0 will need to be performed incrementally, not all sites upgrading at the same time, and perhaps upgrading their services one at a time.  This will additionally have implications on the ITB, but also for the deployed production OSG facility.

Questions:
   * How to characterize a site's provided services?
   * How to publish, disseminate plans for these upgrades (deployments), so as to set VO expectations.
   * Starting point for installation is: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html

---+++ Policy
Need to revisit the description and publication of site and VO policies.
   * Site policy templates
   * VO policy templates


---+++ Compute Element
The following is taken from slides at the Florida OSG consortium meeting (1/06):
<pre>
AAA based on RBAC with certs from VOMS.
GLUE schema 1.2
Possibly extensions for storage
Version 2 not likely before LHC startup.
Plans for June 06:
No ws as part of baseline services in LCG
New RB using condor-c is part of this release. Not clear how exactly this will be deployed. Will figure this out between now and May!
Concern about interoperability!
Gt4 pre-ws -> ok
Gt4 ws
Condor-c
</pre>
