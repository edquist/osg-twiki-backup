---++ Introduction
The OSG_GRID directory is read-only storage area where CE administrators install the [[WorkerNodeClient][OSG-WN-Client package]].

OSG_GRID includes client utilities for Grid middleware, such as Pegasus and srmcp.  It should be writable by root and readable by all users. It must be accessible by both gatekeeper and worker nodes via a shared filesystem, or different installations on local disks using a consistent pathname.

Relative paths and content must be consistent between the gatekeeper and worker nodes, even if the base OSG_GRID directory is different. If OSG_GRID differs between the CE/gatekeeper and worker nodes, create softlinks on the worker node that will recreate the gatekeeper's base path for OSG_GRID.

Site administrators must provide a shared directory or locally install it on each machine.   If this is locally installed on each worker node, you need to take additional steps to make sure that the certifcates used by the worker node client tools are updated correctly.  Please review the [[WorkerNodeClient][OSG-WN-Client package page]].

OSG_GRID may be included directly into the PATH defined for jobs running at the CE.
