---++ Introduction

This checklist provides some environment variables you may need to set before starting the software installation process and some facilities considerations that may need to be addressed.

---++ Previous OSG Installations

   * ReusingConfigurationInformation describes how you can maintain your OSG configuration when installing a new OSG release.  Typically you should pre-set ==OLD_VDT_LOCATION== to  <i>location-of-previous-vdt-installation</i>.
   * You do not need to shutdown OSG services before running the new install on the same machine. However before you start services from the new installation, you will need to shutdown the old services. See [[ShuttingDownCE][OSG Shutdown Guide]] for details.

---++ Exporting Condor environment variables for VDT install

Define and export the variables VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION and VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION to point to your Condor installation (i.e., the directory directly above bin, etc, lib, and so on) and Condor configuration file.  

   * Typically: <pre class="screen">
export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_LOCATION
export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG=$CONDOR_CONFIG 
</pre>

where ==$CONDOR_LOCATION== =<i>/my/condor/location</i> and ==$CONDOR_CONFIG== =<i>my condor_config file</i>

---++ Configuring Condor to optimize Gratia probe performance.

For versions of Condor 6.9.0 and above, one can configure Condor such that it writes !ClassAds into an area watched by the Gratia accounting system upon job completion. If this is the case, the Gratia Condor probe will get all of its information from this !ClassAd file and have no need to execute =condor_history=. This will relieve your gatekeeper of a potentially time consuming and costly operation (especially if you're running Quill). In your Condor schedd configuration (the machine-local condor config file should be sufficient),  add:

<pre>PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR = /<i>path-to-vdt-installation</i>/gratia/var/data</pre>


---++ Condor-cron installation with OSG-RSV
   As of VDT 1.10.0, =condor-cron= (a specially configured installation of condor, previously called condor-devel) is automatically installed with the OSG CE for running OSG-RSV.   If, however, sites choose not to run OSG-RSV on the CE (because it's run on separate monitoring system for example) or otherwise have any problems with installing =condor-cron=, the installation will be skipped if pre-set:

<pre class="screen">
  export VDTSETUP_NO_CONDOR_CRON=y
</pre>

<!--  S. Timm 4/11/08 comment out obsolete info
   * For OSG-RSV, if you want to use a pre-existing Condor *6.9.x* installation, be sure the following variable is set appropriately, otherwise VDT will bring down a full installation of all the condor-devel (i.e. Condor 6.9.4) binaries. The Condor 6.9.x =bin/=, =sbin/=, =etc/=, =lib/= ...  directories should be directly under this location, e.g. =/opt/condor-6.9.3=.
<pre class="screen">
# export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_DEVEL_LOCATION=<i>/my/condor-<strong>6.9.x</strong>/location/</i>
</pre>
-->

---++ Setting !GUMS environment variables for VDT install
To save yourself some steps later on in the privilege (authorization) configuration, set the variable VDT_GUMS_HOST to your GUMS host now.  For example:
<pre class="screen">
# export VDT_GUMS_HOST=<i>mygumshost.domain</i>
</pre>

---++ Operating System and Networking Requirements

   * No Compilers are required to install CE
   * Working network connection is required.  If your site is inside a firewall, has a host firewall (ipchains/iptables), or is using TCP wrappers (/etc/host.{allow,deny}), please review the [[ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Document]]
   * Disk footprint for the OSG CE is ~900MB or ~1.2 GB if Condor for Managed Fork is included
   * Time Synchronization: <b>NTP</b> should be supported on all systems as lack of synchronization complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with grid security infrastructures.
   * Reverse Name Lookups (DNS):  both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system

 
<!-- Jeff Porter 6/11/08: simplified & updated these comments below in the above list
---+++!! Compilers
From OSG 0.5.1 and greater no compilers are required to install the CE. Previous VDT installations presumed that you have a working C and C++ compiler as part of the install.  The gcc and g++ that come as rpms with most Linux distributions are fine.  

---+++!! Network setup
It is assumed that your hardware has a working network connection through which packages may be retrieved and from which services may contact your system. The full OSG CE package is ~900 MB or ~1.2 GB if Condor is installed for ManagedFork. 


---++++!! Firewall
If your installation is inside a site firewall, has a host firewall (ipchains/iptables), or is using TCP wrappers (=/etc/hosts.{allow,deny}=), you'll need to review the [[ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Document]] of this guide and arrange for appropriate Internet access.

---++++!! Time synchronization (NTP) 
Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of e.g. proxy lifetimes. 

---++++!! Reverse name lookups (DNS)
For the middleware to correctly function both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system.

---+++!! Previous OSG or Grid3 Installations
If there is a _previous installation_ of the OSG or Grid3 environment or other Globus middleware, please _stop the processes_ which are currently running. This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), !Integration.MonALISA and other services configured to start upon initialization on your system. Also, if you've sourced the =$VDT_LOCATION/setup.[c]sh= on your previous VDT install, just log out and log back in to clear out your environment.  From VDT 1.6.1 and later (OSG 0.6.0 and later) this can be done with the vdt-control - -off command.

More information is provided in the current [[ShuttingDownCE][OSG Shutdown Guide]] or the Shutdown Guide for the version being upgraded.

---++ Local Account Information

<!--
---+++!! Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs for OSG 
-->

   * Accounts for OSG VOs:  UNIX user accounts need to be created by the system administrator for the VOs. You will need to create at least one local user account (with the appropriate configuration) for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to which you wish to provide resources.  The uid and name of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later during the configuration process.  Since VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's are frequently added to the OSG, you should access the current list of registered VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's at [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/][http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/]] (click VOs). Any new VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's will also appear in on the CE in the file =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt=.
   * Service Accounts:  The Web Service container will be installed to run as the user ==globus== if that account exist. Otherwise it will run as ==daemon==.

<!--
%ICON{"tip"}% *Note:* If there is already a "globus" user on the system, the Web Services container will run as globus, else it will run as "daemon".
-->

---+++!! Do you have a user certificate?
You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests in your =$HOME/.globus= directory.  If you don't have a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy (grid-proxy-init, etc),  see [[UserCertificates][User Certificates]].
