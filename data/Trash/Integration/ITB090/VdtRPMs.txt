---++ VDT Software provided as RPMs

Most VDT software is only provided via Pacman. There are three exceptions to this:

   1. The VDT dCache installation is provided only via RPMs.
   1. The Globus software can be optionally downloaded as RPMs. This is only the raw bits: none of the VDT scripts for configuration are included. It will probably not be useful to most people, but is used by [[http://www.eu-egee.org/][EGEE]. [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installing-rpms.html][Minimal documentation on VDT RPMs from the VDT web site]]
   1. There is an RPM available for the public certificates of the Certificate Authorities distributed by the VDT. It can be downloaded and installed manually or you can use YUM.
