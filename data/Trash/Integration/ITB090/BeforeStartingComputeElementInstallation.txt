_Some suggestions before starting your installation._

%EDITTHIS%

   * Read the [[SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] and know the other servers that will be necessary to get your site going.
   * Most site admins install OSG compute element services as root. Paraphrasing from the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_think.html][VDT site]], if you install as root the VDT's programs can be made available to all the users on your system. Additionally, the VDT will be able to configure and start some of the grid services you might be installing.  Some services can only be run if you are root. _Corollary:_ If you don't install as root, you cannot do these things.  Unless your local policy states otherwise, you will want to install the OSG compute element as root.
   * Consult [[SiteFabricBestPractices]] which may be helpful, and the [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] notes for installation and best practices.
   * Consult [[OperatingSystems][here]] for supported operating systems.
   * You must have a supported batch system (Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE) installed on your CE host machine, or accessible to it.  We provide instructions for installing [[StandaloneCondorInstallation][Condor]] as a batch system if you'd like to use it.
   * You'll need a personal [[UserCertificate][grid certificate]] to run post-install tests.
   * You can apply in advance for [[GetGridCertificates][Host and Service Certificates]] needed by your CE host. There are also [[Trash.IntegrationCertScripts][scripts]] that come with the installation that simplify the process somewhat.
   * Consider the configuration values needed (resource name, server location, local storage locations, and so on); this is discussed in [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationPrepareForComputeElementConfigure]] and [[LocalStorageConfiguration]].
