---++ Installing Standalone Condor Batch System from the VDT

Most site administrators find it convenient to 
have a Condor installation that is independent from the rest of the OSG CE installation.
This allows for upgrading Condor independently of the rest of the VDT, and also allows
for persistent log files even though the VDT is wiped and reinstalled.  We advise to install
Condor in a separate directory from the rest of the VDT.  This installation should be 
done before installing the CE software.

The Condor installation from the VDT will, by default, make a standalone Personal Condor in which 
one machine runs all the daemons, master, collector, negotiator, schedd, startd.   For large condor
clusters there is more information at CondorBatchSystemHints.  For a minimal condor install there
is more information at MinimalCondorHints.

   * Pick an install directory different from where you're going to install the OSG CE software, and =cd= to it. 
   * See CondorBatchSystemHints and MinimalCondorHints for more information.
   * Use pacman to install Condor (shown for VDT %VDT_VERSION%):

<pre class="screen">
# pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/%VDT_CACHE%:Condor
</pre>
      *  By default Condor runs as user daemon, it can use user condor if it is there.
      * Answer =y= when asked about trusting the caches and agreeing to license.
      * Answer =y= when asked if you want to update the CRL's automatically.
      * Answer =l= when asked where to install the CA files.
      * Answer =y= to Condor running automatically.
      * See [[CondorBatchSystemHints]]. 
      * Once the installation is complete, =source setup.sh= and =vdt-control --on= to start up condor.


---++ Alternative install methods
Condor can also be installed via RPMS or .tar.gz files directly from the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads][Condor] Web site.  See that site for instructions 
on how to do this.  This can sometimes prove beneficial since not all bug fix releases of Condor are
necessarily released as updates to the VDT.
