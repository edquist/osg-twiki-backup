---++ Use of trouble tickets in OSG

The OSG uses the [[http://www.grid.iu.edu][GOC]] for central ticketing. From here there are several directions a ticket can be routed, to the VO, service, peering grid, or other OSG collaborator. If you would like to submit a ticket directly to the !GOC  click [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/contact.pl][here]]. Automated ticket exchange from the GOC has been set up with the VDT, EGEE, ATLAS, CMS, and FNAL. If you would like to submit directly to a collaborator some ticketing links are located below.
