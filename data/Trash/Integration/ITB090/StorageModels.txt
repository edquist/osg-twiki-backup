---+ OSG storage models
There are four storage models that a compute element can follow in order to provide storage that have various levels of complexity.  The models are listed below in order of increasing complexity.  

   1. Grid3 Model
   2. Modified Grid3 Model
   3. LCG Model
   4. !dCache Model

All of these models require that directories be shared between the CE and compute nodes using NFS or an equivalent file system.
