An introduction and explanation of the LCG storage model.

---++ LCG Model
The LCG Model follows the LHC Computing Grid's (see further reading below) standard model for storage.  It associates a default storage element (SE) with the CE that can be used to stage data in and out of the CE.  This model replaces the [[StorageParameterOsgData][$OSG_DATA]] or  [[StorageParameterOsgSiteRead][$OSG_SITE_READ]] and [[StorageParameterOsgSiteWrite][$OSG_SITE_WRITE]] directories with a [[StorageParameterOsgDefaultSe][$OSG_DEFAULT_SE]].    However, since many VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo applications don't support or understand how to use a SE to stage data in or out of a site, those directories should be provided as well if your site will provide support for more than a few VOs.  The required areas in this model are
   * [[StorageParameterOsgGrid][$OSG_GRID]]
   * [[StorageParameterOsgApp][$OSG_APP]]
   * [[StorageParameterOsgDefaultSe][$OSG_DEFAULT_SE]]
   * [[StorageParameterOsgWnTmp][$OSG_WN_TMP]]

However, you should also provide [[StorageParameterOsgData][$OSG_DATA]] as well in order to support VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo applications.

A dataflow example may be: 
   * Site admin intervention or external transfer 
   * =srmcp=: $OSG_DEFAULT_SE &rarr; $OSG_WN_TMP
   * Job execution
   * =srmcp=: $OSG_WN_TMP &rarr; $OSG_DEFAULT_SE
   * External stage-out
