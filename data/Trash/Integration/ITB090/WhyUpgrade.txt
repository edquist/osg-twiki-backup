---++ Summary
*OSG %OSG_VERSION%* is based on *VDT %VDT_VERSION%* which contains several new features and bug-fixes from previous versions. For a comprehensive list of changes VDT Version %VDT_VERSION%, see the VDT website:  http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/%VDT_VERSION%/release.html.

We recommend that all resources and clients upgrade to OSG 1.0. <br>
We do not know of any incompatibilities with OSG 0.8.0 clients and OSG 1.0 installations. Please let us know if you encounter any.

---++ Highlights going from OSG 0.8.0 to OSG 1.0
   *  The VDT package no longer includes a version of !OpenSSL. The installation will now rely on the pre-installed version of !OpenSSL. 
   * LCG-Utils has been added to the VDT, and in OSG it appears in the worker-node client package.  LCG-Utils is a collection of tools developed by LCG to access storage elements efficiently. 
   * Several Gratia probe updates, including dCache SRM probes, support for local accounting repositories.
   * Several GIP updates
   * RSV v2 updates, including condor-cron, and new probes for SEs
   * glexec updates
   * [[Bestman]] updates
   * Operational tools to help administrators of storage resources. 
   * Updated version of VOMS and VOMS-ADMIN
   * VOMS Client updates - correct exit status return codes.
   * New names for SRM v2 clients in two flavors, LBNL and Fermi. Support for opportunistic use of storage using SRM V2 interface.
   * Several Globus patches
   * Several CEMon upgrades resulting from experiences in OSG 0.8.
