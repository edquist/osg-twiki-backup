---++ Finding all services that are part of your install

You can use the =vdt-control= command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:

<pre class="programlisting">
# <b>vdt-control --list </b>
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
gris               | init   | do not enable
globus-gatekeeper  | inetd  | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
globus-ws          | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron     | cron   | do not enable   
MLD                | init   | do not enable           
vdt-update-certs   | cron   | do not enable    
condor-devel       | init   | enable                  
osg-rsv            | init   | enable                     
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-5           | init   | enable
syslog-ng          | init   | enable                     
gratia-condor      | cron   | enable
</pre>

For debugging purposes _only_, you can look at =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/state=. This file is automatically generated and should _not_ be edited by hand. It contains all the information used by vdt-control to start and stop services in the VDT. 

Below we break down the services that you can expect to be on your system. All of these are listed by =vdt-control=: they are broken down here in order to give you more information.  Note that the corresponding files will not be moved in /etc/xinetd.d, crontab, or /etc/init.d until the vdt-control --on command is executed, and then only for those 
that are marked "enable" in the list of services above.

---+++ !!The xinetd services that are included
Two services are run via xinetd:
| *Service* | *Description* |
| gsiftp | !GridFTP |
| globus-gatekeeper | The GRAM 2 (pre-web services) interface |

---+++ !!/etc/services
Two entries have been appended to your =/etc/services= file:
| *Service* | *Port* |
| gsiftp | 2811/tcp | 
| globus-gatekeeper | 2119/tcp |

---+++ !!The init.d services that are included in /etc/init.d

| *Service* | *Description* |
| globus-ws | Globus web services |
| mysql     | used by globus-ws |
| condor    | setup optionally by ManagedFork or Globus-Condor-Setup |
| MLD       | MonALISA - setup optionally by configure-osg.py |
| tomcat-5  |  used by CEMon and BDII and optionally globus-ws |
| apache    | In front of Tomcat |
| condor-devel | A new version of condor that is used only to manage the crons from the RSV process | 
| osg-rsv | Resource and Service Validation probes | 
|syslog-ng | optional service to share syslog-ng logs with central ITB staff for debugging purposes | 


---++ Cron jobs
Some cron jobs are installed with random times. Look at =crontab -l= to see which ones you have. Likely candidates are:

| *Cron Job* | *Description* |
| fetch-crl | Update the certificate authority revocation lists. Verify importation for security purposes |
| vdt-rotate-logs | Rotate log files periodically, to keep them from growing too large |
| edg-mkgridmap | If you use a grid-mapfile, keeps it up to date | 
| gums-host-cron | If you use GUMS, generate the osg-user-vo-map.txt file | 
| gratia-condor | Report accounting data from Condor | 
| gratia-pbs-lsf | Report accounting data from PBS or LSF |
| vdt-update-certs | optional way to get new CA-Certificates packages without doing pacman -update | 

---++ Log file rotation
The following is an example of the log files that are configured for rotation. To see exactly what files are rotated in your installation, look in =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt.logrotate=:

<pre class="programlisting">
# Rotate daily
daily
# Keep a week's worth
rotate 7
# Compress old files
compress
compressoptions -9f
# Truncate, instead of moving, files to avoid problems with apps
copytruncate
# Just ignore it if they're not there
missingok
# Rotate these files
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/globus/var/grid-info-system.log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/globus/var/accounting.log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/globus/var/log/gridftp.log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/apache/logs/access_log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/apache/logs/error_log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/apache/logs/mod_jk.log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/apache/logs/ssl_request_log {}
/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/tomcat/v5/logs/catalina.out {}
