---+++ wn-client installation screen

The purpose of this document is to provide a screen capture of the installation process so that the questions presented here can be viewed in their context before reviewing the answer options shown on the parent (Trash.ReleaseDocumentationWorkerNodeClient) page.  The beginning installation asks to trust the caches. A " ==n== " answer will terminate the process.

As seen above, the pacman process discovers all packages specified by the =wn-client= package and begins downloading each one.  As certain  packages are downloaded, the series of questions will be asked to guide the installation are covered here.  The next set of question begins with a license agreement where a " ==n== " answer will terminate the installation (after this series of questions).

Downloading [CA-Certificates-1.8.1.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/questions/1.8.1]...
 
VDT 1.8.1 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:
 
     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.8.1
 
After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.
 
Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] <b> y</b>

The next two questions in this series deal with Certificate handling. The first is where to install certficates: in a system area ( ==r==), locally to the package ( ==l== ), or not at all ( ==n== ).  The second question is whether to setup a daily cron-job to fetch certificate revocation lists from the various CAs.  In the example here, we've answer " ==l== " and " ==n== " for local installation without the fetch-crl cron-job (see options 2 or 3c in Trash.ReleaseDocumentationWorkerNodeClient).

<pre class=screen>
The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).
 

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html
 
Where would you like to install CA files?
 
Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install

<b>l</b>
 
Do you want to run a cron job that will update the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

The last question is about setting up log-rotation - not a issue for the wn-client package: " ==n== " is a reasonable answer.

Downloading [vdt_globus_info_client-VDT1.8.1-x86_rhas_4.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software//globus/4.0.5_VDT-1.8.1]...
Downloading [Globus-WS-Client-1.8.1.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/questions/1.8.1]...
 
Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.
 
Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?
 
Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically
 
Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.
