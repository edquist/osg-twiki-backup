---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  Jeff, Charles, Suchandra, Stu, Rob
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Monday, 4:00pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes

---++ Report from test planning

   * Charles and Suchandra worked out the sets of test-jobs to be run this week via condor-G on UC cluster
      * sets include short and long jobs (to isolate service overhead)
      * sets include gt2 and gt4 for service comparison
      * sets in 2 groupings, small number ~100 and larger number ~1000 to compare to scale
   * In setting up tests, Suchandra will evaluate client settings 

---++ Recent Test Results

   * no explicit news.  Jeff reported that when moving bulk submission test back into Condor-G, RFT timeouts reappeared since Condor-G starts up a gridftp server independent of the globus server.  Fix included adding a gridftp.conf file to condor/etc/ with the line =control_preauth_timeout 300= and editing the condor/libexec/gridftp_wrapper.sh to use this file


---++ Writeup of current round of tests:

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/WSGramWorkingGroupReport][Strawman Group Write up]]
      * set of tests with command line tools are complete and ready to include results
      * set of tests with condor-g are not complete, will include tests Suchandra is setting up as well as bulk tests with data transfers from Jeff
      * Stu would ask Terrence if he will have any results prior to next week
      * Rob suggested including the writeup as part of the WS GRAM testing page instead of a link from it.
