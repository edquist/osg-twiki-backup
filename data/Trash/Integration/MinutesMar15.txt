      * Increasing memory to 1G; turn off prima callout; changing the persistent dir helped.

      * Will post the simple test script on the web.
      * Stu - reference the Nebraska cluster to duplicate tests.  See posted container log.
   * David Meyers also working on WS gram submission with nanohype validation suite.
   * Stu - very interested in getting some Condor-G results.

---++ Preparations for OSG 0.8
   * Comments from OSG-ITB regarding Alain's VDT plan, see [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/documents/PossibleVDTGoalsForOSG0.8.0.pdf][here]]
   * Discussed in today's VDT office hours.
   * Especially we need to make sure GIP related updates get in (Steve, Gabriele).  Steve will circulate a list of joint issues.
   * OSG 0.4.1 attributes are still supported, and they worked with interoperability already, so should be good for 0.6.
   * Xin: storage srm 2.2; need to invite Ted (convening storage group) to integration meeting.  US ATLAS to be involved.
   * David: request to move VDT to Java 1.5. Will follow up with Alain.

---++ VTB and Syslog-ng
   * Discussion of a VTB deployment monitoring a la syslog-ng.
   * Readiness plan - Integration.SysLog
   * Timestamps, zones, log rotation, etc.
   * Central repository per site.  Within a site probably doesn't have to be encrypted.
   * Easy to deploy, config files.
   * Security - may want *not* want to encrypt.  For 0.8 release.
   * Lets start with a simple install on a single host, and collect ws-gram logging info.
   * Brian will circulate a survey to osg-int, to get feedback from site-admins,  sensibilities, concerns.
