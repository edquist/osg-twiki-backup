   * Last meeting, MinutesMay19
   * MeetingMinutes

---++Coordinates

2:30pm Central, 1-510-665-5437 #1212

---++Attending

Sorry everybody - I overwrote the attendees list. 

---++Agenda

   * Installation of ItbRel016
   * SrmDrm testing?

---++Issues

   * Documentation: there are many ITB 0.1.5 and VDT 1.3.5 references embedded.  Long discussion about twiki variables. Needs revisting, and an articulated princple.  Other documation issues?  Anne has some concerns and is moving documents around.  CE install guide very much improved.
      * Note: from the release description there are links to the individual components and services that are referenced by multiple ITB releases.  The service providers are responsible for maintaining notes that affect different releases.

   * VDT 1.3.6 issues comments
      * Sun grid engine job manager can be installed if a site decides to use it.  Note that its not compatible with MIS-CI; breaks GridCat displays and content. Issue for deployment.
      * Athlon64 problems in 1.3.6. (Nate)  Affects Dane's machine, Teraport, and Caltech clusters, UB.
      * Install 32bit perl, overwrite system 64 bit perl? (first in path)  Need to try this, see if there are other problems.  Report back to Nate.
      * BNL: Globus job manager memory leak problem, caused by Nexus security scan. Not much that can be done. VDT will take a look, not sure what can be done since Globus isn't supporting patches to GT3.

   * Anybody with experience to flesh out a description for GenericInformationProviders?
      * Most info is static, except for the batch system variables.
      * Look at the output from an ldap query.  Or run the lcg info generic.

   * Question about what we're using as the GRIS.  GIP 1.2 can work with MDS4.  This is in the MIS roadmap.

   * ITB Site roundup:
      * TTech - configuring with 0.1.6.
      * FNAL-Steve; just finished, no show stoppers; pending temporal GUMS issues.
      * OU - Horst, has installed 0.1.6. All okay.  Karthik working on GUMS.
      * UB - Mark - revevved to latest. Installed on several internal machines.  Only problem with 64 bit.
      * BNL - Xin - finished 0.1.6.  Went well. MIS-CI config needed changing.  There is an option --choose user.
      * UC - Rob - grid03 install. All well so far.

   * GridEx discussion. Mark suggests that gridex check for free processors. Then its only a preemption issue. There needs to be a forum for technical issues that are policy related. The opinion is that grid exerciser should never queue jobs.  There are condor/pbs differences in this perspective.  Another point - getting the results out there so they provide meaningful feedback.  We need to find a compromise here.  Suggest taking this issue to Deployment.

   * Need to document the GridCat site state flag.  Mark feels this should be off by default rather than on.

   * New: AmateurHour - place to log installation notes or other casual tests of ITB.


   * SrmDrm testing.  Interest expressed by BNL, OU, UF in helping with the testing.     


   * ITB 0.1.6 Validations - ATLAS submitting to two sites (BNL, OU).  OU  - 1 job completed successfully.  At BNL, long simulation job is running, 6 queued.  New Caltech tier2d cluster?  Opteron cluster.  Xin will install.

---++ Action Items

   * Work on ITB 0.1.6 installs and documentation fixes; VDT and ITB version twiki variables rationalized.
   * Validations - service and applications.
   * GridEx continues to stir controversy; can this be discussed with both Mark and Jeff present at a future Trash/Deployment meeting, or at the OSG applications workshop?
   * No meeting next week (OSG Applictions Workshop)
