---++ Featured tutorial: Mathematica on a Campus Grid (Lincoln Bryant )
In this tutorial Lincoln Bryant (University of Chicago) will show how it is easy to run Mathematica, a popular computer algebra system, on a campus grid with HTCondor and the CERN Virtual Machine Filesystem (CVMFS). I will also briefly mention how even more resources can be accessed via Parrot.

*About the presenter:* Lincoln is a Systems Administrator at the University of Chicago working with the ATLAS Midwest Tier 2 center and the
University of Chicago Computing Cooperative. He also works with the ATLAS Tier 3 group at UChicago.


   * The tutorial's material is available on [[https://wiki.uchicago.edu/display/uc3/Campus+Grid+Application+Example+-+Mathematica][the UC3 wiki]]
   * Follow Lincoln on Adobe Connect, http://osg.adobeconnect.com/cic-interactive/
   * Recordings form past !iForums or CIC Webinars are available [[http://www.youtube.com/opensciencegrid/][on Youtube]] and at [[http://www.campusgrids.org/#!iforum/cnpt][campusgrids.org]].


---++ BOSCO 1.2 testing
BOSCO is and important product of OSG Campus Grids. It is a different way to connect to HTC resources.

BOSCO version 1.2 beta is available and we are looking for beta testers!
Check the background section here below if you are not familiar with BOSCO.

---+++ BOSCO and BOSCO testing background
If you are not familiar with BOSCO, there is a short introduction, describing also the tests, attached to the [[MinutesCampusItb130110][1/10 minutes]]:
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]]
Bosco documentation is available also in:
   * http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoSCO
The easiest way to install BOSCO is using the [[CampusGrids.BoscoQuickStart][quickstart guide]]

BOSCO testing focuses on three main use cases:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing and how to contribute to it.
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives also an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

---++ Feedback to Developers

---++ Installation support and issue tracking


---++ AOB  
   * Next meeting will be on 6/13

<!--
- Recruitment of early testers, starting with Integration community but open to others
- Providing testers with precise instructions most useful to the BOSCO development team
- Defining specific tests for various platforms and modes

        > single user versus multi-user
        > platforms
        > target clusters
        > required functional testing
        > scale testing
        > operational issues, monitoring

- Collection of feedback
- Tracking issues and bringing to bosco development group
