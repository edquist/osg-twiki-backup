---+!!<nop>Documentation Best Practices - =WHU= Variable for "Where Used" backlinks
%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
---++ =WHU= Variable & Where Used backlinks
%EDITTHIS%

A twiki variable (WHU) has been created to simplify putting the "Where Used" backlinks onto a topic. Normally, this feature is at the bottom, after the STOPINCLUDE statement so that it does not appear in any pages including the topic. 

This variable implements a normal include of WhuReferences:
<verbatim>
   * Set WHU = %INCLUDE{ "Integration.WhuReferences" }%
</verbatim>

An example of output is at the bottom of this page.

   $ *%RED% NOTE %ENDCOLOR%*: This variable only works when set in WebPreferences for the web, unless it is also set in [[Main.WebPreferences][Main.WebPreferences]].

%STOPINCLUDE%
