---++ Agenda
   * Follow-up on issues raised by Alan Sill
   * Follow-up on Condor-G testing
   * Suchandra's testing

---++ Alan's testing
   * Ran Suchandra's submission scripts,  streaming jobs from a client to a ws gram host.
   * Observed things overload on the submit host rather than the gram host.  
   * Made sure to start from  a clean slate.  Believes this is not a standard use case, however.
   * Ravi discussing his tests. Will redo the results for the current installation.
   * Streaming output from host to client not realistic.
   * Stu notes that the gridftp should not be running on the CE.

---++ Condor-G
   * Jeff - doing both WS and gt2 submissions via Condor-G
   * Submitted up to 600 jobs, comparing response of Condor-G. Finding about a factor of 4 longer for WS response.
   * Will include Condor-G settings in report. 
   * Report now linked - JeffTestPage

---++ Discussion
   * For data staging, WS gram requires a gridftp server which is by default on the same host as the ws-gram service.
   * May need to come back to the config instructions in case gram is used for staging.
