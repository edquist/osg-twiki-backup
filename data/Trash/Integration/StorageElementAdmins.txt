---++ Introduction
This page contains how-to guides and other necessary information for ITB Testers who are either setting up a Storage Element or testing a Storage Element Implementation.

*What is a Storage Element ?* 
		
		A SE on OSG is a node/cluster of nodes which

	* Satisfies OSG Requirements (need to point to Marco's link)
	* Provides Storage Space.
	* Is accessible to applications running on OSG through either gridftp and/or srm interface. 
	* Has GIP setup and configured properly which publishes its information.
	* Has well-defined policy for cleanup and usage.
	* Is registered with OSG.

	Graphical view available at http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/pub/Storage/WebHome/WhatisaSE.bmp

For information about CE-Storages ($DATA, ...) and their configuration please refer to LocalStorageConfiguration and LocalStorageRequirements (for requirements and specification).

				  Not Available
Making a Gridftp-based File System that is also a CE-Storage (like OSG_DATA) involves creating a data directory and mounting it on all worker nodes so the storage is accessible to applications running on that site via some environment variables. The SE (host, port, path) has then to point to the same data directory.
---+++ How to Setup SE based on SRM dCache
				  Not Complete. Current Information available at http://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book
Srm/dCache is not directly supported by OSG please see dCache documentation at [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache documentation]].
---+++ How to Setup SE based on SRM DRM
				  Not Complete. Current information available at Integration.SrmDrm

[[http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist/client/][Srm/Drm Installation and Configuration]]


				  Instructions for Installing and Configuring GIP are available at http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/StorageElementAdmins#Generic_Information_Provider_GIP	  
	  

		Not Available 
The SRM Client Tools are an optional module in the OSG Cache. They are supported by the SRM-dCACHE team srm@lbl.gov.
