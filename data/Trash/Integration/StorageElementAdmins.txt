---++ Introduction
This page contains how-to guides and other necessary information for ITB Testers who are either setting up a Storage Element or testing a Storage Element Implementation.

*What is a Storage Element ?* 
		
		A SE on OSG is a node/cluster of nodes which

	* Satisfies OSG Requirements Integration.LocalStorageRequirements
	* Provides Storage Space.
	* Is accessible to applications running on OSG through either gridftp and/or srm interface. 
	* Has GIP setup and configured properly which publishes its information.
	* Has well-defined policy for cleanup and usage.
	* Is registered with OSG.

	Graphical view available at [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/pub/Storage/WebHome/WhatisaSE.bmp][WhatisanSE.bmp]]

For information about CE-Storages ($DATA, ...) and their configuration please refer to LocalStorageConfiguration and LocalStorageRequirements (for requirements and specification).

				  [[Integration.GridftpFS][Setup SE based on Gridftp-based File System]]
Making a Gridftp-based File System that is also a CE-Storage (like OSG_DATA) involves creating a data directory and mounting it on all worker nodes so the storage is accessible to applications running on that site via some environment variables. The SE (host, port, path) has then to point to the same data directory.

				  [[Integration.SrmCache][Install and Configure Srm/dCache]]
Srm/dCache is not directly supported by OSG please see dCache documentation at [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache documentation]].

		[[Integration.SRMTESTER][SRM-TESTER]] is available to test SRM based storage sites as well as popular file transfer protocol such as gsiftp, http or ftp, based storage sites. SRM-TESTER is integrated into the Integration.GridCat and also available as a stand-alone tester. SRM-TESTER can be installed through VDT pacman, or downloadable from http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-dist.
The SRM Client Tools are an optional module in the OSG Cache. They are supported by the SRM-dCACHE team srm@lbl.gov.
