---++ Process and Schedule (Rob)
*Process:*
   * VDT 1.8.0 release
   * VTB test
   * ITB release and testing based on VDT release
   * VDT 1.8.1 release incorporating fixes and minor updates
   * VTB testing of 1.8.1
   * ITB testing of 1.8.1
   * OSG 0.8.0 release 
*Schedule:*
   * Week of 7/30/07: 
      * VDT 1.8.0 released 
      * VTB tests 
      * ITB ITB 0.7.0 testing: packages, cache, central services, core sites
   * Week of 8/6/07:
      * Release ITB 0.7.0 and deploy on: FermiGrid, BNL, UC, CIT, LBNL, OU, TTU.
      * BNL, FNAL, UC and UCSD will provide OSG SEs based on SRM-dCache, in order to support full functional tests for VOs requiring local storage.
   * Week 8/13/07:
      * ITB install fest?
      * Start sites and service validation
*Other notes:*
   * VO validation schedule 
      * Open up for VO validation soon as above happens August 13 earliest or up to August 20, depending on problems, responsiveness of experts who can fix problems, etc.
   * The ITB is expected to start at 0.7.0, but will likely experience at least one upgrade for example, to a incorporate changes that result from the validation process leading to, eg., VDT 1.8.1
   * Interoperability validation: 
      * Jobs running through LCG; will need to describe specific requirements.  Allan will volunteer to help burt
   * Documentation
      * In parallel to this will be the creation of the OSG 0.8 documentation set for CE, SE, and Client installations.
   * The final, signed-off ITB 0.7.x will provide the basis for the next deployment of OSG 0.8.  The speed at which this happens will depend on how quickly the ITB, VDT, VO applications can validate.   We will set a specific deadline within the next two weeks.

---++ VTB testing (!Suchandra)
   * ValidationTestbed
   * VDT 1.8.0 released
   * 4 VTB sites (UC, FNAL, LBNL, Caltech)
   * Default package is pointing to 1.8 VDT.
   * Needs help for gratia (Chris Green)  and cemon validation (Ress- Gabriele); validation via twiki.
   * There are a few bugs Suchandra is fixing - OLD_VDT_LOCATION not being picked up properly.
   * Another change - a request from Chris Green to update Gratia probes for sites with multiple gatekeepers.
   * UC, LBNL, CIT
   * Suchandra will announce.

---++ ITB Trash/Deployment Readiness (!RobQ)
   * ITB 0.7 release web: ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
   * Need to have plans for installing and validating storage element  *any update?*
      * should encourage VOs to have workflows that test storage element
      * should check and validation how information about SE is advertised
      * OSG Storage group should be contacted to get their involvement
   * Need to incorporate information service and advertise well defined attributes
   * Need to start discussing documentation and release process for documention
      * Install guide
      * Should have VO roundups and checking (what Abhishek did in the last cycle)

---++ ITB Validation (Charles)
   * Need to setup equivalent of Trash/Integration.SiteValidationTableITB052
   * Jeff will get this setup for ITB 070, and will bring Charles up to speed.

---++ Documentation (Anne)
   * Goal:
      * Provide documentation that sys admins are happy with.
   * Current plan: Anne's 1st draft list of "to-do" items for release doc prior to 0.8.0 release
   1. Have non-integration group persons review each doc in release doc table for readability, structure, order of steps, etc. (Maybe selected sysadmins)
   2. Have integration group modularize each release document as they update it (moving further in direction that was started in 0.6.0)
   3. Have integration group read and evaluate [[Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]] as model for simplified, special-case installation guide.
   4. Create simpler install guides for special (common, recommended) cases from modularized pages.
   5. Determine task-to-document and role-to-document relationships,
   6. Create doc hub structure accordingly, to provide structure for and links to release doc table

   * Documentation.WebHome
      * I'd like people to review [[Documentation/AdminDocHub]] to see if "areas of responsibility" are reasonable, and to help me complete the list.
      * Your impressions of [[Documentation/VoManageDocHub]]; and review of "areas of responsibility"
      * I need help figuring out who needs and wants what information.  Contextual and procedural.
      * I want to assign responsibility for some pages to others. Identified so far are:
         * Documentation/AdminDocVOApp -- Chris and Abhishek
         * Documentation/SupportCenterDocHub -- Rob Q and ops people

   * Jay will provide some GUMS.

---++ WS gram testing update (!Suchandra)
   * Currently running a series of tests (sleep jobs of 30, 60, 120, and 300s) with a varying number of jobs (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200)
   * Will have tests comparing prima vs. non-prima tests
   * Will have tests with staging in and staging out data
   * Will run tests with condor 6.9.5 
   * Other tests will be run over the next days and results will be circulated by end of weekend
   * will create initial draft of performance memo next week with goal of having final version done for executive board within 3 weeks
   * Suchandra is pulling results together - will provide draft EOB.


---++ ITB Central Resources Readiness (!RobQ)
   * BDII
   * VORS
   * Gratia
   * !ReSS
   * Rob reports all okay.  Will prune these to only the current

---++ ITB Site readiness

      * Tanya will install dcache 1.8
   * BNL is setting up a ITB testbed (gateway, 5 worker nodes, 50GB dcache SRM)
      * hardware set up and waiting for software
      * SRM testbed ready by end of next week, 16 TB Sun thumper;  will also worker nodes.
   * UC
      * Will setup dcache srm; reconfigure pbs to use compute nodes.   Ready by end of week.
   * CIT
      * One gk, 5 wn, FC4.
   * LBNL
      * VTB site will be re-used as ITB site; 1 gk and three wn.  Potentially another cluster?
   * OU
      * ITB cluster - 8 node, 1 gk.
   * TTU
      * 1 gk, 2 dual cpu nodes; srm-bestman
   * IU  
      * 1 gk, no wn.
   * CIT-CMS
      * Will put up a ITB site;  install on top of production 240 batch slots with default priorities.  Will dedicate 8-12 slots for ITB.  Next Friday at earliest.

---++ SE Testing Plan (Alex Sim)
   * OSG 0.8 testing of the SRM interface.  Accounting, next release.
   * SRM functionality to v1.2 - availability monitoring.  Need to link to the OSG ITB storage monitoring service.  This was done by John R in the past; Arvind will check with !RobQ. 
   * Testing performed daily.  20-30 minute tests, including gridftp file transfers.  Published results will be available.

---++ Syslog-ng (Alain Roy)
   * Its setup as an option at the moment.
   * Will collect logfiles at ITB sites; expand to some other logfiles (example, potentially tomcat files).
   * Decide later what to collect before deployment of OSG 0.8.

---++ AOB
   * ws-gram results will be discussed vtb meeting on Aug. 7
   * Late news - Alain reports a problem in the current VDT release, if the pathname is too long in VDT_LOCATION.
