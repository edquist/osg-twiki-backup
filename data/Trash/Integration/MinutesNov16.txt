---++Introduction
Minutes of the Integration meeting, November 16, 2006
   * Last meeting: MinutesNov9
   * Previous meetings: MeetingMinutes
   * Coordinates: 2:30pm Central, 1-510-665-5437 #1212

---++Attending
   * Rob Gardner, Jeff Porter, Shreyes Choila, Steven Timm, Horst Severini, Karthik Arunachalam, Doug Olson, Illya Narsky, Philippe Canal, Tanya Levshin (for Gabriele Garzoglio).
   * Apologies: David Meyers, Shaowen Wang & GROW.

---++ Gratia testbed in the ITB
We need to develop a plan for testing Gratia fully in the ITB or VTB environment.
   * Philippe gave a review of the installation method. 
   * Goal is to gather accounting information from service providers. Probe on CE's (from Condor,  eg). 
   * An rpm is provided.  Point to the right Gratia server (both OSG and ITB hosted on the same server).  See guide. 
   * You'll see information begin to show up on the server after 15 minutes.
   * In order to get the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo information correct - you need to use the reverse gridmapfile.  Will upgrade to use GUMS.
   * Have a PBS and LSF probe.  Shreyes at LBL is developing a sun grid-engine Gratia probe.  Will work with Chris.
   * A patch is needed for Globus; its also in VDT 1.3.10 has it as a pacman package.
   * Validation - if everything works, you should see the proper VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo association, and time used by a job.  We can probe more deeply after this.
   * Sites that will deploy for this ITB cycle:
      * LBL - upon completion of the SGE probe.
      * UC - will deploy Condor probe on ITB site.
      * OU - already has a Condor accounting probe running, reporting to a different server - its slightly different than Gratia.  
      * FNAL_FERMIGRID_TEST, FNAL_GPFARM_TEST - will install Condor probes.
      * CMS-ITB @ fnal (Burt) has this installed, but pointing to production Gratia server.
   * OSG needs to standardize on the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo naming (HorstsVONamingIssue).  Rob will follow-up. See Main.SupportedVODataForCENode for more information.
   * Philippe will attend in two weeks to follow-up with us.

---+++Background information for Gratia
_an email from Philippe:_

Gratia has 2 main 'components'.  The probes (Condor Probe, PBS Probe) and the Servers (Collector and mysql database).   The servers are not quite ready for full scale deployment and it was decided to (at least until the release of OSG 0.6.0) have only one Server are Fermilab. VDT 1.5.x already includes an alpha release of the Servers.

The server at Fermilab supports a few 'instance':

   * - the production server for OSG: http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/
   * - an identical server for the ITB: http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8881/gratia-reporting/
   * - a production server for 'daily/summary' report

Within a week the VDT team will provide pacman based patch mechanism for the 2 VDT release in production in the OSG.  This patch release and/or applying the patch by hand to 'fix' the file condor.pm is a pre-requisite to install the Gratia Condor probe, which can be done via rpm.

So depending of the time scale we are looking at, one could today already start to install the Condor, LSF or PBS probe and do the patch to condor.pm 'manually' and point the probe to connect to the ITB Gratia Server.

All the information need should be at  http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/ProbeInstallation

Cheers,
Philippe.

---++ Clarification on glue schema usage for application release publication, consis w/  WLCG

Begin forwarded message:
<pre>
From: "Wang, Shaowen" <shaowen-wang@uiowa.edu>:
Date: November 16, 2006 1:02:03 PM CST
To: Robert Gardner <rwg@HEP.UCHICAGO.EDU>, OSG Integration <osg-int@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG>
Subject: Clarification on glue schema usage for application release.

Hello,

GROW will not be able to attend today's ITB. Most of us are at SC|06.
Here is a short summary about how application info is published through
GLUE schema in WLCG/OSG.

Both WLCG and OSG publish software name information in
GLUEHostApplicationRunningEnvironment. Currently, some LCG sites publish
software version and path info through GLUELocation entities. OSG does
not yet push installed software information to GLUELoation entities. 

But if ATLAS or other VO applications wish to use installed software
info within GLUELocation entities, it is straightforward to collect and
publish such info in OSG. 

Cheers,
-Shaowen
</pre>
   * Steve - what is new is that we can now put in a GLUELocation entities.  Will follow-up with Shaowen.
   * Xin will need to examine the convention used by ATLAS in LCG, and follow that for OSG.

---++ ITB 0.5.1 
   * Issues from the SiteValidationTableITB051 
   * From here on out, lets submit these as RT tickets (see email to =rt-osg-itb at bnl.gov=) --see below.
   * UC - still need to install 
   * CEMon failures - Tanya
      * Most site admins not available for comment.
      * At CIT_ITB_1,  - not installed and no plans.  We need to indicate this in the twiki.  Add a new catagory "Not installed".
      * Need to follow-up with BNL_ITB_Test1, 
---++ VTB
The Validation Testbed is described in IntegrationProject.
   * Leigh has created a VTB cache, http://software.grid.iu.edu/vtb/.
   * Usage:
<pre>
    CE:
    pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/vtb:ce-151

    Client:
    pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/vtb:client-151

    WN-Client:
    pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/vtb:wn-client-151
</pre>
   * This will be kept current with the most up to date VDT versions.
   * A request will be sent to Saul to add a short name for the cache as VTB.

---++ RT queues for osg-itb, osg-vtb
We are introducing RT as a system for "issues" management in both the ITB and VTB, courtesy Brookhaven National Lab (special thanks to Tomasz Wlodek for kindly setting these up).   To create an issue, simply send an email to: 
   * =rt-osg-itb at bnl.gov= for ITB issues
   * =rt-osg-vtb at bnl.gov= for VTB issues
Anyone can send email these lists, no special permission is required.  To be able to submit and view pending and resolved tickets via a web interface, and more importantly to become a "watcher" of the queues (you get an email for all submitted tickets and replies), you need to send an email to =RT-RACF-UserAccounts at bnl.gov=.   Then, you can go directly to the web interface to view tickets:
   * [[https://rt-racf.bnl.gov/rt/Search/Results.html?Query=Queue%20%3D%20'OSG-ITB'][ITB tickets]]
   * [[https://rt-racf.bnl.gov/rt/Search/Results.html?Query=Queue%20%3D%20'OSG-VTB'][VTB tickets]]
When you receive an RT email, you can reply to that mail and the ticket is updated automatically.


---++ AOB
   * Next week is Thanksgiving; meet again in two weeks.
