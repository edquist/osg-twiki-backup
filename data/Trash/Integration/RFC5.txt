---++ Motivation
The proposal is to restrict the allowed settings for the =authorization_method= setting in the =Misc Settings=  was requested by the security group so that admins are required to specify how their resource handles authorization and so that this is properly configured for the resource.

---++ Scope
Configure-osg will be altered to require the =authorization_method= setting to be set to either =xacml=, =gridmap=, =prima=, or =local-gridmap=.

---++ Effects / Changes
Admins currently setting this to =UNAVAILABLE= will need to change this to either =xacml=, =gridmap=, =prima=, or =local-gridmap=.  The =local-gridmap= setting will be added to support resources that are using a local gridmap for authorization.  

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.8. 

---++ Current Status
Posted to osg-int for discussion.
