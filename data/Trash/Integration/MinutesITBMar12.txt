   * CE doesn't have any problems,
   * CDF is having problems with SE, srmls is returning problems, investigating
---+++  LBL - Keith/Iwona  - CE/GUMS (in VTB)/Bestman/GLExec 
   * Things back up after adding 2 new disks, CE is verifying again
   * DZero validated
   * CDF needs to do SE validation now that SE is back up
   * Have seen an intermittent error in gip validation page (appears to on other sites)
      * Burt looking at this
---+++ UC_ITB - Suchandra CE/SE/GUMS
   * Dcache and Bestman SEs up
   * CE up but tracking down a pbs issue
    
---+++  TTU  - Alan - CE/SE

   * WLCG 
      * Waiting for list of sites passing tests
   * Clients
      * Iwona would test this after SE 
   * GLExec
      * FNAL was able to test against GLExec,  couldn't get the job load needed to check intermittent error
   * VO Validation
      * ATLAS -- testing against UC_ITB
      * CDF -- completed sleep job, testing monte carlo 
         * Sleep jobs
            * Completed
               * BNL
               * FNAL
               * Caltech
            * Fails
               * UC_ITB
               * LBNL_ITB
         * SE
