---++ Attributes review document
   * Anand: I have put together pages containing all attributes being published by OSG-GIP as was agreed upon at the attributes meeting last Tuesday. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/GIPAttributes The page also reflects my understanding their current status. I also have added a comments column, where people can add comments. Please feel free to update the and let me know if you need any extra information there.
   
---++ Overview
   * Excellent start - discussing the process for identifying critical attributes, reviewing.
   * Six categories, identifying whether static or dynamic for attributes, and default values.
   * We need to concentrate on attributes we're not clear about, those we identify as critical and required to be correct.
   * Note John R is working on storage testor modules in gridscan, with Steve.

---++ Subcluster 
   * A subcluster is a group of nodes with similar characteristics.
   * Presently cannot gather details about how the cluster is split, or what is considered a "subcluster".
   * Note - this will require more thought for the next version; for now, we need to just note the considerations.

---++ Crucial attributes
   * Networking: Glue network host adaptor
   * Question about multiple CE's on a site - how are they uniquely identified?
   * Question about double-counting in the case of having two CEs in front of a single cluster.  Eg. number of CPUs.   Currently no easy way around this problem.  This should be noted in the attributes description.
   * We're probably not going to get number of cores, and memory.
   * !GlueCEInfoLRMSVersion  -leave off for first version

---++ Tools and Tricks
   * Steve's cemon wrapper script - Steve
   * Java ldap browser - David http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gawor/ldap/

---++ Next steps
   * Anand will provide a little more text to go around the attribute descriptions.
   * Then will send request for comment from osg-int and osg-users.
   * Discuss again on Thursday.
