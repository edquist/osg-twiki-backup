---++ Follow-up on WS Gram testing and issues (Jeff)
   * See meeting notes from yesterday, MinutesWSGramFeb26

Meeting yesterday goal to test and doc on the ITB. Most sites are correct, Jeff is running test using Condor-G. Stress testing. Advertising of service ports, are we picking up this port information? Not currently with VORS. Alain will tell John R how to find port and modify site verify run by gridscan. Terrence was going to contact groups using WSGram, needed more informaiton. Jeff built list for him. Problem, how do we grab information needed to run WSGrams, can we put this in a place where they can get to it? How are people accessing BDII? LIGO uses VORS back end interface to pull information for submission. Other WSGram issues? No known showstoppers at the moment.

---++ ITB Survey (David M)
   * Integration.SiteValidationTableITB052  - validation table overview.

Testwulf now has low error rate on PBS batch manager. Turned down priority of GridEx jobs. David will try running again. Top 5 sites are stable with LIGO tests. More VOs are now testing. A lot of success this week, a few problems still exist. 


---++ Follow-up on VO testing on ITB: progress and issues (Abhishek)

From mail sent by Abhishek:

  "Fermilab, LIGO, SDSS -- have completed validation!
  GADU, GROW, CompBioGrid -- hopefully reaching final stages!
  CMS, ATLAS, NANOHUB -- work in progress.
  DZero -- have agreed to go ahead without validation.
  CDF -- have probably decided to go ahead without validation?"

  "An update -- GADU, GROW, Fermilab, and SDSS have now confirmed a completed validation"

ATLAS 2/5 sites work, CalTech does not support the way ATLAS runs. ATLAS will try again on IUB-ITB. 

CompBioGrid problems with stage in, moving on to SRMCP. 

CDF may not be able to validate this week. Just rely on squid, they think things will work.

Most sites were up all the time. 

---++ Gridscan update (John R)
   * http://dev2-scan.grid.iu.edu/

Link sent in mail by John, storage element testing with storage_verify.pl. Working with FNAL to see where it works. Do we have a configuration script for SE? Not at this point.They should register with the GOC. Storage elements will be integrated into OSG, more progress will be forthcoming.  

---++ Follow-up on LDAP certificate issue: (John W)
   * From last week: %BLUE% LDAP cert not needed - since we're not running MDS?  Does the gums probe use this?  Perhaps the host cert could be used.  Ownership (by tomcat) issue (and renewal)?  Note - this is covered in the GIP documentation.  *John W will take this issue offline with Steve, Gabriele, and Anand*. %ENDCOLOR%

No new news on this issue. Is this a real problem, or a documentation issue. Could be a doc issue. John will add this to the docs. 

---++ Follow-up on CEMon stability (John W.)

Tonya is looking into this. It will not affect the release.
