---++ Motivation
The proposal is to replace the =site_name= setting in the Site Information section with =resource= / =resource_group= settings.  The change is to match the current terminology and information in OIM/myOSG and to reduce the effort needed in reconciling gip and gratia information with site registrations.  The changes were requested by Brian Bockelman.

---++ Scope
Configure-osg will be altered to support a =resource= and =resource_group= setting in the =Site Information= section.  Backward compatibility will be achieved as follows

   * If =site_name= is present but resource_group is not present:
      * =site_name= will be used as the =resource_group=
      * a warning will be issued to the console indicating that =site_name= is being deprecated
      * if =resource= is also missing, a warning message indicating that this should be set will be issued
   *If resource_group and site_name are present:
      * =resource_group= will be used in preference to =site_name=
      * a warning will be issued to the console indicating =site_name= is being ignored 
      * =$OSG_SITE_NAME= will be populated using =resource_group= or =site_name= with =resource_group= being preferred

---++ Effects
The changes will be backward compatible.  Admins with existing =config.ini= files will not need to make any changes and will be able to use existing =config.ini= files.  To switch to new =config.ini= formats, an admin will need to remove the =site_name= section and add the =resource= and =resource_name= groups and make sure that they are appropriately populated.

=$OSG_SITE_NAME= in =osg-attributes.conf= will not be changed so job environments will not be altered.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.5 (the release after the current release in testing) in order to facilitate changes needed in gratia and gip.

---++ Current Status
Implemented in configure-osg and in ITB testing.
