Subject: RE: [Fwd: Fwd: Gratia OSG Daily reports]

Hi all,

we're working on having our ATLAS Tier2 cluster report to Gratia as well,
and we're testing this out right now, and in the process I noticed that
there are some inconsistencies with VO names in various places,
which we should probably fix.

I think this is partially due to the odd way in which 
monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt maps is case sensitive and 
insensitive names:

#voi cdf fermilab fmri gadu grase ivdgl mis sdss star usatlas uscms ligo dzero 
dosar des glow grow gridex nanohub geant4 i2u2 mariachi osg osgedu
#VOc CDF FermiLab fMRI GADU GRASE iVDgL MIS SDSS STAR ATLAS CMS LIGO DZERO DOSAR 
DES GLOW GROW GRIDEX NANOHUB GEANT4 I2U2 MARIACHI OSG OSGEDU

ATLAS and CMS are the only two VOs which have different names in those
two lines. Why? Well, too late to argue about that now, since it'll
probably be hard to change that now, since Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA accounting
probably depends on it.

But there are other, more important places which we should fix to be
consistent:

On the Gratia page,

http://cd-psg2.fnal.gov:8884/gratia-reporting/

we currently have cms, uscms, and usatlas reporting.

Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA,

http://monalisa.grid.iu.edu/

currently knows about ATLAS, USATLAS, CMS, and USCMS, but only 
ATLAS and CMS are apparently being filled, since the two US... VOs
have no entries as far as I can see.

GridCat,

http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/

shows usatlas and uscms as VOs for the various sites.

The VORS pages,

http://vors.grid.iu.edu/

use CMS and USATLAS.

The VOMS Monitor,

http://voms-monitor.grid.iu.edu/

uses CMS and USAtlas.

And the GUMS template file has

accountingVo="usatlas" accountingDesc="ATLAS"
accountingVo="uscms" accountingDesc="CMS"

which I guess is consistent with grid3-user-vo-map.txt, not surprisingly.

And the DOEgrids Certificate request page,

https://pki1.doegrids.org/

gives you the options CMS and USATLAS.

By the way Doug, could you please request an additional note at the
bottom of this page that people HAVE to select the 1024 bit key.
Most browsers these days start with a default of 2048 bit, but everybody
I know who recently requested a certificate and left it at 2048 
was not able to export their certificate from their browser,
no matter that OS or browser they used, and had to request a new
certificate with 1024 bit, and that worked fine then.
So there seems to be a pretty strong correlation/indication that 2048 bit
just doesn't work.

I'm sure there are other places which use/monitor/report VOs in various
spellings and capitalizations, too, but I can't think of any more right now.

So, what should we converge on for the names and capitalizations 
of the actual VOs in the future, like for Gratia, which is just 
starting to collect data?

I'd say ATLAS and CMS, since that's what Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA is using, 
and that seems to be the most wide spread tool these days.
Comments?

Oh, this reminds me of another VO related issue.
Ruth, you asked a while back if DOSAR was going to provide dedicated
resources. We now do -- the OU Condor pool and the new OSCER cluster
(topdawg) -- but how would we count them and get credit for them? 
The Resource registration page,

https://goc.grid.iu.edu/registration/main.php?whichReg=rp

doesn't give you the option to register VO as a resource owner,
but only a support center, which is not exactly the same thing.

And Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA doesn't give you the option to extract something like
"jobs run on sites owned by a particular VO", but only 
"jobs run by a particular VO on any site". So I guess the OSG model
doesn't really track VO owned resources much, or at all?
Just curious.

Thanks,
have a good weekend,

	Horst
