---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  Stu, Jeff, Gabriele, Tanya, Neha, Anand, Suchandra, Charles

---++ WS GRAM Service Information in ReSS 

   * Below are questions raised in Gabriele's email we used as a starting point for discussion (though some were not dealt with directly):
      * what is being filled today for WS GRAM? %BLUE% Answer: Nothing & GIP is not collecting any information %ENDCOLOR%
      * how mature is the schema?  Will the Service Name and Type values be changing?
      * how many WS GRAM interfaces per site?
      * how to add WS GRAM service information to current Computing classads
         * append in a comma separated list?
         * if more complex, how to connect this information to a given cluster / CE?

The general discussion moved on to the question of how to add information for WS GRAM.  Currently there is a Service Entity defined in Glue Schema 1.3 that may be suited for WS GRAM as a Service.  That entity, however, is currently being used for other purposes (e.g. web-proxy, authorization services, ...) and using it to advertise WS GRAM could pose 2 problems:  1) overloaded attributes in the Service Entity  2) the information is not well connected to the Compute Element. The latter problem of not connecting to the CE seems critical for how one should use the WS GRAM information.  Thus we  decided to begin by having the information as part of the Compute Element Entity.   With this choice, we should ensure that pre-WS GRAM and WS GRAM can be managed independently so that having both or either GRAM is allowed.    It was also suggested that having 2 CE entities (one pre-WS and the other WS GRAM) pointing to the same sub-cluster was OK.  That is likely how we will proceed. 


   * compare with direct query to GRAM service via =wsrf-query= as part of globus mds.  %BLUE% The wsrf-query could be a useful starting point for a GIP implementation though it was noted that the current implementation is GlueSchema 1.1 %ENDCOLOR%

   * Related question from Rob G %BLUE% Never got to this question %ENDCOLOR%
      * Will we require a tool like =lcg-siteinfo= to query information specific to WS GRAM?

---++ Summary & Action Items

   * We noted this effort needs to begin now if we're to have an implementation in time for OSG 1.0.
      * Anand does not currently know if he will be responsible for this GIP implementation.
   * Gabriele and/or Anand will provide example (filled) Compute Element and Service Entities from pre-WS system
   * Stu, Charles and Jeff will review those examples and translate to a WS GRAM model for a straw-man starting point
   * Considerations for the straw-man and subsequent iterations:
      * should not extend the CE Glue Schema as it causes problems for the GOC to maintain - Anand
      * the globus MDS team may be of help for retrieving the relevant information from the service as accessed by GIP - Stu
      * verifying the completeness of the information relative to meaningful workflows, perhaps interacting with Condor-G folks is important - Charles
