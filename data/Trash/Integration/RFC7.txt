---++ Motivation
This proposal is to  provide a copy of the latest =config.ini= used to configuration a CE apart from =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=.  This will allow admins to compare their =config.ini= file with the file distributed for CEs.

---++ Scope
A new file will be present with a copy of the latest =config.ini= for ce configurations.

---++ Effects / Changes
=$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/ce.ini= will be present in new installs and after updating.  This file will have the a pristine copy of the latest config.ini.  No other changes will occur, =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= will still be used for configuration.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.8. 

---++ Current Status
Posted to osg-int for discussion.
