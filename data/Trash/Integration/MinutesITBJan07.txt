   * Initial testing done at !UoC (Jose)
   * Automated feed of info about ITB sites into Panda schedconfig - work in progress (Maxim)
      * GOC ticket filed: jobmanager data was dropped from !MyOSG and this needs to be fixed before we can proceed

      * working out details in scheduler configuration and testing in Panda
      * intermittent ITB installation problems in the past couple of days
   * Next steps:
      * Configuring extra sites: queue configurations for 6 sites listed
      * Pilots coming in using VO osg and vo-role pilot      
      * FNAL - needs glexec for glideins 
         * gLExec support in ITB Panda pilot is an action item
         * GUMS configuration issue: message from Steven Timm: <verbatim>
              it appears that the Fermilab GUMS server never adjusted for a change in the OSG VO gums entry.  We have the OSG VO configured
              for matchFQAN="exact" and nowadays the GUMS template says matchFQAN="vo".  So since you are coming with /osg/Role=pilot
              instead of /osg GUMS is rejecting you.  We will look into this and see what we want to do. For most other VO's we make a separate
              user id under which to run the pilot jobs and that is probably what we will do here too.
