---++ !CEMon / Gratia configuration (Suchandra)
   * There was a change in the behaviour of the services from being on by default in OSG 1.2.3 to being off by default in OSG 1.2.4
   * See [[Integration.RFC3][RFC 3]] for details
   * Changes in default settings will go into OSG 1.2.6
   
---++ Documentation Issues (Brian / Jim)
   * The conclusions from our November meeting with Suchandra & Marco:
      1 For major releases with many changes, the release documentation tree will be copied to the ITB TWiki and then modified for the new release.  When the release goes to production, this tree will become the new production tree and the old tree will be moved to the a previous release tree.  Changes that are made to improve documents that are independent of the new release will have to be made in the ITB and production TWiki.
      1 For point releases with few changes, the documentation will be modified with notes and a new document tree will not be created.
      1 For point releases with changes concentrated in a particular area, only that area will be copied to the ITB TWiki for extensive modification and then put into production as above.  (Note that the entire documentation tree will have to be preserved under the previous release number and the new release tree is formed with the previous tree with the modified area.  This will become possible after the documentation is reorganized into directories related to the architecture. %ENDCOLOR%
   * Suggestions:
      * Create a document tree for OSG 1.0 and strip out the OSG 1.2 notes from that
      * Remove OSG 1.2 tags and keep text in OSG 1.2 document tree
          * May need to create a judgment call and split documents specific to certain pages if things get too unwieldy
