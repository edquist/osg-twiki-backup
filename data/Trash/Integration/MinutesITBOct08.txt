---+++ Grid Colombia Workshop (Rob)
   * OSG will be hosting a workshop in Bogota, Colombia during two weeks in October.  The themes are:
      * October 20-23, 2009: Scientific Computing on Grids: Introductory Grid Computing Overviews and User Capabilities
      * October 26-30, 2009: Building Grid Infrastructure: Towards a National Colombian Science Grid
      * The first week follows the traditional "grid school" model introducing grid technology to students and researchers new to distributed computing
      * The second week will consist in building a small prototype grid in Bogota as a means of introducing site administrators to the techniques of installing grid service.
      * Think of it as the very first "ITB Install Fest" (held in Chicago, 2005 - website no longer exists!) 
   * *Would like to enlist ITB experts in remotely assisting our Colombian colleagues in their endeavors*
      * We will use Campfire; Bogota is in the same time zone as Chicago.
      * Dates: *October 27, 28, 29* for assisting grid administrators
      * Please let me know if you're interested in volunteering for this OSG service activity (eg. by donating a couple of "on-call" hours).  We will follow up with more organizational details.
   * *We are also looking for sites to accept student submitted jobs via the OSG EDU VO*
