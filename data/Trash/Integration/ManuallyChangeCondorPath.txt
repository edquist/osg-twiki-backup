---++Introduction

A prerequisite for the OSG installation is a locally installed batch system.  That is, OSG does not install a batch system for you, aside from the basic personal condor install that is suitable only for testing.  If you need to reinstall a batch system after the installation then the existing OSG installation can get confused.  This page describes what needs to be changed to update the OSG install to point to a new Condor installation in a new directory.

---++Modify Configuration Files

When the VDT is installed, the location of the batch queue is passed to many configuration files.  The following files must all be modified so that the original condor location is replaced with the new condor location.  After making these changes, be sure to restart MonALISA.

   1. *$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/condor-env.csh*
   1. *$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/monalisa.properties*
   1. *$VDT_LOCATION/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/condor.pm*
   1. *$VDT_LOCATION/globus/libexec/globus-script-condor-queue*
   1. *$VDT_LOCATION/globus/setup/globus/condor.pm*
   1. *$VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Service/CMD/site_env*
