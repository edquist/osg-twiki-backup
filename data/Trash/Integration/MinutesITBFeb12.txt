---++ ITB ticket 11868 - GIP/configure-osg changing VO names in their code (*folllow-up*)
%BLUE%----------------------------------%BR%
Main.JohnWeigand comment 2/5/09%BR%
This is a tough one to explain so be patient.

With this release of GIP and configure-osg.py, there is a subtle transformation of the VO name used for advertising (GIP) and validating (configure-osg.py) VO names that are defined in these OSG provided
templates:
   1 edg-mkgridmap.conf
   1 gums.config

Both of these files are used to define the "sub-vo/group" as defined in the generated osg-user-vo-map.txt file on:
   1 the #voi line... for example,
   <verbatim>#voi cdf uscms   </verbatim>
   1 the detail line... for example   <verbatim>
#---- accounts for vo: cdf-cnaf ----#
cdf cdf
#---- accounts for vo: uscmsuser ----#
uscms01 uscms   </verbatim>

The value 'uscms' is derived from:
   1 in edg-mkgridmap.conf, the 3rd token is used for the #voi entry and for the detail lines mapping unix account to vo/subgroup/whatever      <verbatim>
# USER-VO-MAP uscms CMS -- 11 -- (uscms-ops@fnal.gov)
group vomss://voms.cern.ch:8443/voms/cms uscms01</verbatim>
   1 in gums.config, the accountingVO attribute value is used for the same<verbatim>
<groupMapping name="uscmsuser" accountingVo="uscms"
accountingDesc="CMS"/></verbatim>

Both GIP and the configure-osg scripts are reading the detail lines (unix account to vo/subgroup). They are stripping the 'us' from all entries that being with that value, as in 'uscms' being 'cms, 'usatlas' being 'atlas', et al.
   1 GIP uses the changed value for advertising the support VO for the site.
   1 configure-osg.py uses the changed value for validating the sponsor option of the Site Information section of the config.ini.

The issue I am raising is that we should not be "burying" this type of data translation within the code of a service.

We should be making changes to the source of the data. In this case, the 2 templates mentioned above.

I recognize the potential for a transitional period where some sites may not have made the necessary changes and this type of implementation (where it is done in the code) seems justified. However, in the log run and as this kind of thing proliferates, these things will come back to haunt us. There really needs to be a better solution.

   * Will check with VOs and service providers

---++ VO naming and support issues (Suchandra) 
   * gums-host-cron / edg-mkgridmap error reporting
   * other issues
   
---++ Documentation Issues 
    * *gums-host-cron/edg-mkgridmap log location need to mentioned in configuring prima section (John)* 
    * Edit section button / view section button switch
    * Global cache name has a problem (currently set to OSG ITB)

---++ Bug Review (*follow-up*)
