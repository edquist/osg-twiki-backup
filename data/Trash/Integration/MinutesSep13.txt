---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: 
   * Apologies: 
   * Coordinates: Thursdays, 2:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1122
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes

---++ ITB 0.7.0 background
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.WebHome
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.SiteValidationTable   <--- Please update w/ latest


---++ VO Validation (Jeff, Charles, Abhishek)
   * Integration/ITB_0_7.SiteValidationTable#VO_Site_Validation_Table

---++ WS Gram problems
   * Xin apparently is still having problems
   * Neha apparently solved the problems she has encountered but we should verify this and make sure the patches to condor-g that fix this are going into vdt 1.8.1

---++ Interoperability (Burt)
   * (last week) *Burt's site and Purdue are the only sites currently reporting correctly. Sites should apply patch and new patch should be applied and configure_gip should be rerun.*  Has this happened?

*From Burt*

<pre>
Report on EGEE PPS / OSG ITB interoperability efforts:

* EGEE has given us simple guidelines on validating CEs (mainly simple "hello world" type jobs, but using the full WMS chain).  No guidance yet on SE validation.

* We will send out a document stating what minimal environment OSG is guaranteed to provide to all users.  We'll write the proposal in time for meeting on Tuesday.  I expect it will outline OSG_GRID, OSG_APP, and a handful of utilities in OSG_GRID (srmcp, uberftp, etc.)

* OSG ITB sites require a patch which I sent out a few weeks ago in order to properly show up in the EGEE PPS BDII.  The following sites appear properly in the PPS BDII:
  - CIT_ITB_1
  - CMS-BURT-ITB
  - FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB
  - LIGO-CIT-ITB
  - Purdue-ITB
  - TTU-TESTWULF

  The sites only partially reporting (or not reporting at all):
  - BNL_ITB_Test1
  - UC_ITB
  - IUPUI-ITB
  - UCSDT2-ITB1 (note: we are doing some other interoperability testing involving multiple ITB gatekepeers reporting a single site name, so UCSDT2 may not show up correctly).

Andreas Unterkircher has begun submitting gLite tarballs to unpack on $OSG_APP with an eye on forwards compatibility (EGEE plans to centrally install WN software across the entire EGEE at some point in the future). We now have effort at FNAL to submit validation jobs via gLite WMS that will use the existing OSG WN client, and will start testing shortly.
