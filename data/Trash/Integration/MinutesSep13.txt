---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: Neha, Charles Huang, Rob Gardner, Suchandra, Doug, William Law, Ted, Steven Timm, Horst, Karthik, Abhishek, Jeff Porter, Michael Thomas, Stu, Rob, Charles Bacon, Xin, Alan Sill, Alain Roy, Anne Heavy
   * Apologies: 
   * Coordinates: Thursdays, 2:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes

---++ ITB 0.7.0 background
   * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
   * ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable   <--- Please update w/ latest


---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Validation (Jeff, Charles, Abhishek)
   * ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable#VO_Site_Validation_Table
   * Several VOs started testing
      * Fermilab was successful on all sites on the table
      * SDSS had similar success
      * LIGO had problems with a few sites ( CIT_ITB, UC_ITB, BNL_ITB )
         *  Charles will follow up on problems with sites
         *  Abhishek has details
            * BNL_ITB_Test1: Job 1 queued since 09/10/07 10:01 AM
            * UC_ITB: Job 1 queued since 09/07/07 11:46 AM
            * CIT_ITB_1: Can't run due to NFS-lite issue.
            * IUPUI-ITB: Idling at job8 since 09/07/07 12:18 PM
      * Engage will start testing soon as well
      * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo testers will email itb list as problems arise to facilitate troubleshooting  
      * More VOs expected to test next week

---++ WS Gram problems
   * Xin apparently is still having problems
      * Problems due to condor configuration not including gt4 configuration
      * Changing configuration fixed this
   * Neha apparently solved the problems she has encountered but we should verify this and make sure the patches to condor-g that fix this are going into vdt 1.8.1
      * Two problems:
         * Globus security algorithm not found
         * Gridftp mapping to wrong user
      * Problems solved by updating to more recent version of condor (first problem) or by using the workaround described in the ws-gram validation page
      * VDT 1.8.1 has condor-g patch that will fix second problem as well
      * Second problem was present in earlier osg releases -- due to assumption that client and server are on different machines 
   * Problems due to clients running older condor version should be highlighted
   * Validation and documentation for ws-gram should be clarified in regards to condor-g submissions, need better client validation documentation
   * Information services don't advertise ws-gram availability and presence (bdii, ress, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS)
    
---++ Interoperability (Burt)
   * (last week) *Burt's site and Purdue are the only sites currently reporting correctly. Sites should apply patch and new patch should be applied and configure_gip should be rerun.*  Has this happened?

*From Burt*

<pre>
Report on EGEE PPS / OSG ITB interoperability efforts:

* EGEE has given us simple guidelines on validating CEs (mainly simple "hello world" type jobs, but using the full WMS chain).  No guidance yet on SE validation.

* We will send out a document stating what minimal environment OSG is guaranteed to provide to all users.  We'll write the proposal in time for meeting on Tuesday.  I expect it will outline OSG_GRID, OSG_APP, and a handful of utilities in OSG_GRID (srmcp, uberftp, etc.)

* OSG ITB sites require a patch which I sent out a few weeks ago in order to properly show up in the EGEE PPS BDII.  The following sites appear properly in the PPS BDII:
  - CIT_ITB_1
  - CMS-BURT-ITB
  - FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB
  - LIGO-CIT-ITB
  - Purdue-ITB
  - TTU-TESTWULF

  The sites only partially reporting (or not reporting at all):
  - BNL_ITB_Test1
  - UC_ITB
  - IUPUI-ITB
  - UCSDT2-ITB1 (note: we are doing some other interoperability testing involving multiple ITB gatekepeers reporting a single site name, so UCSDT2 may not show up correctly).

Andreas Unterkircher has begun submitting gLite tarballs to unpack on $OSG_APP with an eye on forwards compatibility (EGEE plans to centrally install WN software across the entire EGEE at some point in the future). We now have effort at FNAL to submit validation jobs via gLite WMS that will use the existing OSG WN client, and will start testing shortly.

</pre>
   * Need more detailed  work with William to identify and clean up attribute presentation and display before production deployment
   * Will relaunch attributes subcommittee to work on this

---++ Other problems
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS file
      * Host DN for LIGO had extra characters and need to be fixed
      * *Charles will follow up with Rob Quick to get this updated*
      * RobQ will remove characters that Charles mentioned
      * RobQ will discuss other field with Alain and John Weigand to determine if it can be removed

---++ Site Status Reports (Site Admins)
   * BNL
      * VOs should be able to run jobs on site now
      * Firewall issues should be resolved now
   * FNAL 
      * working on glExec 
   * UC
      * !ReSS has problems due to firewall issues
      * Working on dcache 
   * CIT ITB
      * only issue is nfs-lite remote initial dir problem, still working on fixing
   * CIT LIGO
      * no problems seen so far
   * TTU 
      * have itb bestman up and running
      * tested pre-itb versions of voms and vomrs and those appear to be running
   * UCSD 
      * no major updates, expect ligo to use se at some point

---++ Documentation (Anne)
<pre>
 - working through vomrs install and organizing voms and vomrs doc

- Ruth brought up UserCertificate -- it's full of Fermilab info; I will look through it and make it generic

- need to redo WN install now that I have a host cert

- need to finish ce install

- finished voms install and doc update

- are people actually updating twiki pages as they find things? Also, people need to review what I've changed -- for correctness and to answer red questions.
</pre>
   * Will start efforts next week
   * Document sections will be handed out to people to review
   * Will have another report next week

---++ AOB
   * glexec testing
   * squid testing
