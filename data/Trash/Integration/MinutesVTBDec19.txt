---+!! VTB Meeting, Dec 19, 2006
%TOC%


---++ Attending
   * Suchandra, Rob, John, Jeff, David, Alain

---++ VDT 1.5.2 Testing
   * VDT 1.5.2 testing in a number of ways - three sites (FNAL, UC, CIT)
   * David reports that the Condor-Globus job manager setup seems to be causing problems. He thinks his Condor job manager was not configured correctly at all.  Alain believes this is working.   Alain will have a closer look at David's installation before the end of the week.

---++ VDT 1.6.0 Status
   * Still nailing down remaining bugs - there are some small changes still being made.
   * Aiming for a Thursday release.  
   * Configure GIP - new things from GROW.

---++ VTB
   * Suchandra now adding versioning.
   * Has added a package for VDT 1.6.0.
   * More on VTB below.

---++ Compatibility service checking
   * GUMS and VOMS checking for backwards compatibility - can the VTB test this?  Yes.

---++ Using Xen environments
   * John is limited in his tests to a single host, so he is using Xen for multiple services (gram, gums, voms) but has some limitations.

---++ Configuration script
   * John is worried about lots of changes being made to this configuration OSG script, making it modular and introducing dependencies that he solved with his rewrite some time ago.
   * Alain explained what the concurrent configure GIP script does, how it relates to the OSG configuration script, etc.  He will send around an email with the details.
   * John will have a look at this script and suggest changes; *will it require an osg-configure.sh rewrite?*
   * Suchandra suggests setting up CVS repository for this script and VTB packages.   He will set something up at UC based on SVN.

---++ Schedule and Sumary
   * We have ITB completion *deadline* for OSG 0.6.0 deployment on 2/15/07.
   * VDT 1.6.0 to be released on Thursday.
   * VDT 1.6.1 to be released at the end of the the first week of January and will include things we find during VTB testing.  This will be the ITB release (*for ITB 0.5.2, to be released on 1/8/07*.) 
   * Suchandra will have VTB packages for each of these VDT versions (1.5.2, 1.6.0, and the changing 1.6.1).
   
---++ AOB
   * Need an osg-vtb mailing list.
   * Next VTB meeting on *January 2, 2007 (3:30 pm CST)* to check-in and re-focus.
