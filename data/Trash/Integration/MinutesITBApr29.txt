---++ Validation Table Review
 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB090/SiteValidationTable][Validation Table]]
      * CE validations:
         * General: Jeff reports from Burt that sites failing to report to ITB-BDII is under investigation 
         * FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB - mostly Validated.  advertising to ITB-BDII fails, glite-ce-monitor.log claims connectino refused to ress-4 but appears to work, will be installing new wn-client
         * CIT_ITB_1 - is updating with VDT-1.10.0.a today 
         * BNL_ITB_Test1 - CE appears ready but is double reporting in GIP. Xin and Brian are working on this. 
         * UC_ITB - CE is ready.  Will be running the fermi-test-suite on the dcache SE
         * LBNL_DSD_ITB - CE appears ready. Some config problems with ubuntu-7's sh linked to dash leaving some classad attributes to fail. Don't know if other problems will appear due to this. 
         * LBNL_VTB, OUHEP_ITB, IU_COBRA_ITB are on the table as test sites and have validated most components
         * CIGI-ITB - will do new install with 1.10.0a and validate. Current ITB-0.9.0 install doesn't show up on ReSS service. Will re-check after new install and report problems if any.
         * General classads comments/questions:
            *  PBS sites still fail the overall "isClassAdValid" due to "GlueCEInfoTotalCPUs=0". Should we remove this criteria?
            *  new CEMon now reports more attributes, should we replace/augment current validity checks?
            *  should there be a SE check on validity? 
      *  SE validations
         * Ted notes that the SE validation table will be modified slightly, after that we will begin to fill it out.
         * Also new link is shown pointing to a new [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB090/InstallationITB][StorageElement-ITB-How-To]] set of docs currently being developed
         * opportunistic storage will be tested by selected VOs targeting selected ITB sites.
      * VO validations
         * DOSAR, LIGO, and NANOHUB have begun testing and checked off some sites
         * LIGO problem (no pegasus) on LBNL_DSD_ITB understood and fixed
         * Dzero has started some test.
