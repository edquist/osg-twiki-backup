---++ BOSCO introduction
In these attached slides there is a short introduction to BOSCO and the tests.
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]]
Bosco documentation is available also in:
   * http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/BoSCO

---++ BOSCO Testing 
[[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

The three main use cases are:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check Trash/CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing.

Xin did some tests but his Condor cluster requires special Classads in order to run jobs, so the submission worked but jobs did not run.

Horst will perform some tests before the next meeting.

---++ Feedback to Developers

In the BOSCO 1.2 meeting earlier this week we discussed the features of BOSCO 1.2:
   * mainly improve usability and error reporting
   * provide an easy update mechanism
   * add Gratia probe for accounting
   * add the possibility fo have per-cluster attributes like the ones required by Xin or to submit to osg-xsede

---++ Installation support and issue tracking

Joel Snow expressed his interest to Horst but was unable to attend. Marco will follow-up.

Rob had some issues running jobs but he was using a couple months old version of BOSCO. The problems he was having cannot be reproduced with the current version. At this stage of development BOSCO is changing quickly, so adopters should update to the latest version (BOSCO 1.1 at the moment).


---++ AOB  

Rob Quick needs to run many short-lived jobs (over 30 millions 2-3 min jobs). There is no sutomatic way to group them to reduce the load on the submit host. Pegasus is doing something like that. Derek and the HCC group manually grouped similar jobs.

---+ Tasks

Next meeting will be on 1/24

<!--
- Recruitment of early testers, starting with Integration community but open to others
- Providing testers with precise instructions most useful to the BOSCO development team
- Defining specific tests for various platforms and modes

        > single user versus multi-user
        > platforms
        > target clusters
        > required functional testing
        > scale testing
        > operational issues, monitoring

- Collection of feedback
- Tracking issues and bringing to bosco development group

What if only few
