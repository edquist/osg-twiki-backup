---++ Discussion
   * Charles:
      * Pprocess undertaken with Globus toolkit. Think about target audience we're aiming for. Current docs seem to be focused on site admins.  Users, VO's.  
      * Decide on the user groups, then think about what they want to know.  Site admins - how to install.  Users - how to get clients.
      * Lay out an empty grid. 
      * Re-use existing - perhaps using auto-include.  Weakness is that it doesn't necessary flow well in all situations.  Perhaps then works better as a reference document.
      * Need a well-defined template for reference material.
      * Synopsis documents are needed - eg. CE guide.  Needs to be process driven, separate advanced reference material.  Too easy to get lost. 
   * Ian SR: so much twiki documentation.  Am I reading the same documentation?  Agreed this is a problem.
      * Will have someone starting part time for OSG support - fresh set of eyes going through the process.
   * Who should revise?  Old hands, new hands - need input from both sides.
   * Alain:
      * Do we have a charge?  Seems like its indirect.  And no effort.
      * Get-together for two days.
   * Abhishek: wiki structure is well-suited for bringing in input - but it does affect coherence.  Does lend a problem with keeping coherent.
   * Charles - docbook is used in globus. Note that osgedu uses docbook for their presentation modules.  Use of templates helps keep information coherent.
   * Suchandra - not much effort.  We've focused on the server side, but user tools and SE information have not received much focus.
   * Jeff - focus on the user. "What can you do with the OSG?"    Twiki - have found to be slow. 

---++ Action items
   * Need to get a clear charge.  Will circulate a statement among this group, forward to Ruth.
   * Plan on a two-day sit-down meeting soon after OSG review
   * Perhaps add a session at the all hands in March.
