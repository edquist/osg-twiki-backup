---+++/etc/xinetd.d services
Ensure that you've disabled the Globus Gatekeeper and <nop>GridFTP from inetd or xinetd.  If you are using xinetd, you can do
<pre>
&gt; chkconfig globus-gatekeeper off
&gt; chkconfig gsiftp off
</pre>

If you do not have chkconfig, edit <i>/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper</i> and <i>/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp</i>, and set disable = yes.

If you are using inetd, then edit inetd.conf, and comment out the lines for globus-gatekeeper and gsiftp.  

Lastly, restart xinetd and inetd by:
<pre>
&gt; /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
            or
&gt; /etc/init.d/inetd restart
</pre>


---+++/etc/init.d services
The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down, it may fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading (see sample shutdown session below):

<pre>
&gt;   /etc/init.d/gris stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/mysql  stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/globus-ws stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/MLD stop 

&gt;   /etc/init.d/apache stop     <b><i>(if CEMon has been activated)</i></b>
&gt;   /etc/init.d/tomcat-5stop   <b><i>(if CEMon has been activated)</i></b>

&gt;   /etc/init.d/condor stop   <b><i>(or other installed job manager)</i></b>
</pre>

For OSG 0.4.1 or prior, there is a CRL update service that needs to be stopped.  In OSG 0.5.0+ releases, this is a crontab and is addressed in that section.
<pre>
&gt;   /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop 
</pre>

---+++crontabs
For OSG 0.4.1 and prior releases, the <i>root</i> cron processes that should be commented out are:
<pre>
0 0 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
</pre>

For OSG 0.5.0 and beyond, the <i>root</i> cron processes that should be commented out are:
<pre>
34 5 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
0 0 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
</pre>

For OSG 0.5.0 and earlier releases, the <i>mis</i> cron entry for MIS-CI can be removed by executing the following:
<pre>
&gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh    <b><i>(for OSG 0.5.0 and earlier releases)</i></b>
       or
&gt; crontab -r -u mis
</pre>

---+++Additional considerations
---++++<nop>MySql / <nop>Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA / Globus web services
Bear in mind that <nop>Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA also uses a database backend.  Here is how to find out whether [[Trash.Trash/IntegrationMonALISA050][Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA]] is running, and if so, under what user:
If you are using OSG 0.4.1 or higher, <nop>Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA is most likely using the postgres database.  

If you have installed/activated Globus web services (<i>/etc/init.d/globus-ws</i>), it will be using a <i>MySql</i> database as it's persistent storage for the current state of the services.
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww | grep -i monalisa
</pre>
and for the mysql or postgres daemons associated with !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA, check using:
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww | grep -i mysql
       or
&gt;  ps -efwww  | grep -i post[master,gres]
</pre>

If you are running a Rocks cluster, be sure to kill only the OSG-related mysql processes and avoid inadvertently stopping any cluster-related ones.  In general, pay attention if you need to kill any database-related processes explicitly; for example, look to make sure they are related to !Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA or Globus web services,  and/or are running out of your VDT installation area before stopping them.

If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you should
remove the <i>/etc/init.d/MLD</i> link if it exists, as this will link to the <i>ML_SER</i> in your old <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i>.


Also check to see whether there are any stray OSG-related processes, such as run-mis-ci.sh, globus-job-manager, and so forth still running, and kill them manually if necessary.  

---++++If VOMS and/or GUMS is Running on Machine
This is not recommended.<br>
The process involves bringing down the tomcat servlet container, the included apache distribution, and mysql server.

<pre>
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/tomcat-5 stop
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/apache stop
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/mysql stop
</pre>
