Describes recommended best practices for OSG site monitoring and metrics. From [[Main.SteveTimm][SteveTimm's]] talk on [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=455][Lessons Learned & Best Practices]].

---++ Monitoring Packages in the OSG
There are four major monitoring packages in the OSG:
   * *<nop>MonALISA*
   * *MIS-­CI*: feeds GridCat, did feed ACDC dashboard)
   * *<nop>CEMon*: feeds the Generic Information Provider
   * *GRIS*:  feeds Generic Information provider

Frequencies of all monitoring software in the OSG are adjustable. See documentation for more information. Going slower than the default frequency is essential to a smooth operation.

The more things that are calling =condor_q=, the more potential for trouble.

Recent report suggests that grep can be faster if <tt>LOCALE=C</tt> rather than =US-­ENGLISH=

If a VO is listed in =grid3-­user-­vo-­map.txt=, your site needs to support it. =grid3-­user-­vo-­map.txt= has to be right before the Generic Information provider (GIP) is configured

Be sure Generic Information Provider (GIP) advertises the right number of job slots. Otherwise, it's a &#8220;kick me&#8221; sign to the LCG.
Be sure Generic Informatin Provider (GIP) advertises the right number of job slots. Otherwise, it's a &#8220;kick me&#8221; sign to the LCG.

CEMon is new. We have been running it at FNAL under OSG 0.4.1.  It can be memory­-hungry.

Do we have to split some monitoring off to another node? Maybe eventually, especially with advent of web services. 

Monitoring should use =condor_q ­-format= and =condor_status ­-format=.
