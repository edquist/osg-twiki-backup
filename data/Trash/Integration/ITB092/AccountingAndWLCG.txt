---++ Overview
Accounting records collected by Gratia are forwarded to the EGEE accounting system, APEL.    This is important for US-LHC Tier1 and Tier2 facilities which have to demonstrate to the LHC project delivered computing resources on behalf of ATLAS and CMS collaborations, in accordance with signed Memorandum of Understanding agreements.  A service outside the OSG software infrastructure (VDT) runs at Fermilab, parses and analyzes accounting records for a resource, scales wall time figures into SPEC_int2000 for the processor type, and then forwards to an APEL server at the EGEE GOC.

For a more detailed description of the interface, refer to the OSG Accounting APEL/WLCG interface document at Accounting.GratiaInterfacesApelLcg.

---++ Known issues
   * An effective SPEC_int2000 rating must be computed based on the admixture of processor types behind a CE.  A [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Admins/SurveyFormSite.html][site survey]] was conducted by OSG to determine this initially. SPEC_int2000 figures for a given set of resources installed since this survey should be reported to John Weigand at Fermilab.
   * The issue of using SPEC_int2000 as a performance benhmark is becoming increasingly problematic as the benchmark has been deprecated, replaced by SPEC_int2006.  There are additional complications arising from differences in server/motherboard manufacturer, compiler option settings, etc.   There has been discussion of forming an agreed set of metrics for OSG using information collected through !HEPiX, evaluations within labs participating in OSG, etc.  At present, the following table has been prepared: see [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Admins/AccountingP2.html#Scaling_factors][this table for Fall 2007]] for *Fall 2007* figures.
   * The file =osg-user-vo-map.txt= *must* be kept up to date to correctly associate resource usage by specifc Unix accounts in the accounting records to the corresponding VO.
