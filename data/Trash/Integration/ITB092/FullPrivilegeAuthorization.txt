---++ This page is obsolete

This Web page is obsolete. It is here just to host a few bits of information that have not been verified to exist elsewhere.

Please refer to for [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationFullPrivPreConfig][the Full Privilege Authorization information]] from now on.

---+++!! Web services configuration files
The default authorization mode for WS_GRAM is Local or Compatibility.  It uses the =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= as the basis for authorization.  

To enable Full Privilege mode you must run the =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.py= script after you have completed the previous configuration steps. During the execution of this script, a check is made to determine if you have already configured your node to use the Full Privilege authorization mode.  It does this by looking for the existence of the =/etc/grid-security/prima-authz.conf= file.

If that file exists, the script extracts <i>Your-GUMS-Server</i> information from the file and executes the command:

   * <pre class="screen"> $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_prima_gt4 --enable -gums-server <i>Your-GUMS-Server</i> </pre>

The script modfies four WS-GRAM security configuration files,  activating the PRIMA callout functionality for the Full Privilege authorization mode, in =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/=:
   * =globus_delegation_service/factory-security-config.xml=
   * =globus_wsrf_core/global_security_descriptor.xml=
   * =globus_wsrf_rft/factory-security-config.xml=
   * =gram-service/managed-job-factory-security-config.xml=
