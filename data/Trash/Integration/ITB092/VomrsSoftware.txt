When you install the VOMRS node, it comes with quite a bit of software.  This section will help you learn how to find out the details for yourself.

---++ Discovering exactly what software has been installed
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
&gt; <b>vdt-version </b>
You have installed a subset of VDT version 1.8.1a:
    Apache HTTPD 2.2.4
    CA Certificates v32 (includes IGTF 1.17 CAs)
    Fetch CRL 2.6.2
    GPT 3.2
    Java SDK 1.4.2_14
    Java 5 SDK 1.5.0_12
    Logrotate 3.7
    MySQL 4.1.22
    MySQL Connector/J 5.0.6
    Apache Tomcat 5.0.28
    Apache Tomcat 5.5.23
    VOMRS 1.3.1c
    VOMS 1.7.20.1
    VOMS Admin (client 1.2.15-1, interface 1.0.5-1, server 1.2.19-1) 1.2.19-1-0
</pre>

---++ Finding all services that are part of your install
You can use the =vdt-control= command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  vdt-control --list
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-55          | init   | enable
tomcat-5           | init   | enable
voms               | init   | enable
vomrs              | init   | enable
</pre>

For debugging purposes _only_, you can look at =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/state=. This file is automatically generated and should _not_ be edited by hand. It contains all the information used by vdt-control to start and stop services in the VDT. 

Below we break down the services that you can expect to be on your system. All of these are listed by =vdt-control=: they are broken down here in order to give you more information.

---++ The init.d services that are included
The services installed and enabled are:
| *Service* | *Description* |
| apache | In front of tomcat |
| tomcat-5 | used by VOMS WEB UI webservices |
| tomcat-55 | used by VOMRS WEB UI and webservices |
| mysql | Used by VOMS and VOMRS |
| voms | this is the voms server that services =voms-proxy-init= requests |
| vomrs | vomrs server that perform notification, synchronization with voms etc |


In addition, during the installation, a test VO called =VDT= will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the =VDT= VO will have to be performed separately.
