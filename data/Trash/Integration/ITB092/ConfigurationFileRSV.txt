---++ Introduction to RSV Section

This section gives information about setting the options in the RSV section.

---++ Options

The options given in bold type are mandatory.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *enabled* | =True=, =False= | This indicates whether the rsv  service is being used or not.  It should be set to True or False. |
| rsv_user | String | This gives username that rsv will run under.  If this is blank or set to UNAVAILABLE, it will default to rsvuser. |
| *enable_ce_probes* | =True=, =False= | This indicates whether rsv should run ce probes is being used or not.  It should be set to True or False. If this is enabled, several of the following options must be set as well |
| ce_hosts | String | This option lists the FQDN of the CEs that the RSV CE probes should check.  This should be a list of FQDNs separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3). This must be set if enable_ce_probes is set. If this is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE, the CE's hostname is used by default. | 
| *enable_gums_probes* | =True=, =False= | This indicates whether rsv should run gums probes is being used or not.  It should be set to True or False. If this is enabled, several of the following options must be set as well |
| gums_hosts | String | This option lists the FQDN of the CEs that use GUMS servers that the RSV GUMS probes should check.  This should be a list of FQDNs separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3).  This will default to the ce_hosts option if it is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE | 
| *enable_gridftp_probes* | =True=, =False= | This indicates whether rsv should run gridftp probes is being used or not.  It should be set to True or False. If this is enabled, several of the following options must be set as well |
| gridftp_hosts | String | This option lists the FQDN of the gridftp servers that the RSV gridftp probes should check.  This should be a list of FQDNs separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3).  This will default to the ce_hosts option if it is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE | 
| gridftp_dir | String | This should be the directory that the gridftp probes should use during testing.  It must be given if enable_gridftp_probes is enabled. This defaults to /tmp if left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE. |
| *enable_srm_probes* | =True=, =False= | This indicates whether rsv should run srm probes is being used or not.  It should be set to True or False. If this is enabled, several of the following options must be set as well |
| *srm_hosts* | String | This option lists the FQDN of the srm servers that the RSV srm probes should check.  This should be a list of FQDNs separated by a comma (e.g. my.host,my.host2,my.host3).  This will default to the ce_hosts option if it is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE | 
| srm_dir | String | This should be the directory that the srm probes should use during testing.  It must be given if enable_srm_probes is enabled. |
| srm_webservice_path | String | This option gives the webservice path that  SRM probes need to along with the host: port. For dcache installations, this should work if left blank or left out. However Bestman-xrootd SEs normally use srm/v2/server as web service path, and so Bestman-xrootd admins will have to pass this option with the appropriate value (for example: "srm/v2/server") for the SRM probes to work on their SE. | 
| *use_service_cert* | =True=, =False= | This option indicates whether rsv should use a service certificate or not.  If this is enabled, the following three options must be set as well.  This should be set to True or False. |
| rsv_cert_file | String | This option should point to the public key file (pem) for your service  certificate. If this is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE  and the use_service_cert  setting is enabled, it will default to /etc/grid-security/rsvcert.pem | 
| rsv_key_file | String | This option should point to the private key file (pem) for your service  certificate. If this is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE and the use_service_cert  setting is enabled, it will default to /etc/grid-security/rsvkey.pem . |
| rsv_proxy_out_file | String | This should point to the location of the rsv proxy file. If this is left blank or set to UNAVAILABLE and the use_service_cert  setting is enabled, it will default to /tmp/rsvproxy. |
| proxy_file | String | If you don't use a service certificate for rsv, you will need to specify a  proxy file that RSV should use in the proxy_file setting.  This needs to be set if use_service_cert is disabled. |
| *enable_gratia* | =True=, =False= | This option will enable RSV record uploading to central RSV collector at the GOC.   This should be set to True or False. |
| *print_local_time* | =True=, =False= | This option determines whether rsv will display times in the local time in the web pages that it produces.  If this is disabled, times displayed will be given in the GMT time zone.  This should be set to True or False. |
| *setup_rsv_nagios* | =True=, =False= | This option indicates whether rsv try to connect to a local  nagios instance and report information to it as well. This should be set to True or False. |
| rsv_nagios_conf_file | String | The rsv_nagios_conf_file option indicates the location of the rsv nagios  file to use for configuration details. |
| *setup_for_apache* | =True=, =False= | The setup_rsv_nagios option indicates whether rsv try to create a webpage that can be used to view the status of the rsv tests.  Enabling this is  highly encouraged. |
