An introduction to the format of the configuration file used by configure-osg.py.

---++ General Layout

The configuration file used by configure-osg.py is similar in format to the ini configuration file used by windows.  Long lines can be split up using continuations as specified in RFC 822.  A config file is separated into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. =[Section 1]=) .  Lines that begin with a =;= or a =#= are treated as comments and ignored.  Options can be set using either =name : value= or =name=value= pairs.  Finally, variables and variable subsitutions are supported.

---++ Variables and variable substitution
The configure-osg.py parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file.  Within a given section, any option set in that section can be used as a variable.  Note, this means that you will need to be careful not to try to use a option name as a variable in order to avoid a infinite loop when resolving the variable substitution.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name =myoption= in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as =%(myoption)s= .  Please note that the trailing =s= is required.  Also the variable substitution will only occur when setting an option, so option names can not have a variable substitution in them.

---++ Default Section
The config file also supports a special section labeled as =[Default]= .  Any option defined in this section can be referenced as a variable at any point in the file.  In the sample =config.ini= file, this section is used to define the =enable=, =disable=, =unavailable= variables as well as some variables that may be handy throughout the configuration file.
