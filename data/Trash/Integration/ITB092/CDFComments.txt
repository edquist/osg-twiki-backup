as of 28-May-08 

CDF glidein's startup at BNL but there are authorization problems on the CDF side
(So we feel that the test is successful enough)

CDF glidein's return no error or log files for the UC (working with UC admin's to solve)

---++ ITB Validation

This section discusses comments from CDF regarding validation on ITB 0.9.2 for OSG 1.0.

*Status as of March 02, 2009*

We are using the service certificate of SAM for accessing the SE.  Its host/key method is being used for authentication with the storage element. There  exists
problem in accessing all the  ITB SE using the SAM service certificate.  The concerned site admins had been informed.  Following 
are the response from the site admins.

*From FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB*

The SAM cert is failing because it does not have a VOMS attribute.
All accounts in the CDF VO are required to have a VOMS attribute
to successfully map in GUMS.  I realize that it is impossible
to use a SAM service cert in its intended method, as a host/key
pair, that way.

Comment:  We are using the SAM service certificate for accessing the SE provided by UCSD and Gridka.  It seems that the problem is related to FNAL site.

*From BNL_ITB_Test1*

The  SE  "srm://grid19.racf.bnl.gov"  don't exist. It is not feasible to check the SRM operations with the available gridftp server only.

We are waiting for response from other site admins.
