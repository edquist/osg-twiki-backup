---++ 64 bit support
VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS nows runs on 64-bit computers. However, there are some known problems with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin.

VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin is the web interface to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS. VDT 1.7.1 has version 1.2.19-2-pre2-0. There have been persistent failures when installing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin on Fedora Core 4, x86-64. Although this is not a widely used platform, the problems are not well understood and it is not known if they will manifest elsewhere.

If you install VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin and the installation fails while installing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS:

<pre class="programlisting">
Package [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VOMS] not [installed]: 
Package [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VOMS] has not been installed.  Can't setup. 
Package [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VDT] not [installed]:
Package  [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VDT] has not been installed.  Can't setup.
</pre>

Look in the +$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log_. If you see an error like this while installing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-Server, it may be the same problem and the VDT team would like to know about it. Contact them via email at vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org.

<pre class="programlisting">

</pre>

Also, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Admin 1.2.19-2-pre2-0 contains a known bug ([[https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=13863][https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=13863]])for which VDT has installed a workaround. However, the workaround disables the automatic request clean-up feature. It is hoped a that this will be resolved in a subsequent release before any automatic clean-ups would occur.
