---++ *Introduction*

We validated the DOSAR VO by running a theoretical particle physics test code. 
This prgram takes numerical values as an input file and produces its results on stdout.
It was condor_compiled to run in the Condor Standard Universe via Condor-G -- both gt2 and gt4-ws -- on OUHEP_ITB (running osg-0.9.0), and all jobs finished successfully. 

---++ *Submission Procedure*

The binary was submitted with the following Condor-G submit files for gt2 and gt4-ws, respectively.

<pre>
GT2:
----
universe        = grid
grid_resource   = gt2 osgitb1.nhn.ou.edu/jobmanager-condor
stream_output   = False
stream_error    = False
globus_rsl      = (jobType=condor)
transfer_input_files = cteq6l1.tbl
WhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT
executable      = test.exe
output          = test.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
error           = test.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
log             = test.$(Cluster).log
queue 5

GT4-WS:
-------
universe        = grid
grid_resource   = gt4 https://osgitb1.nhn.ou.edu:9443 Condor
stream_output   = False
stream_error    = False
globus_rsl      = (jobType=condor)
transfer_input_files = cteq6l1.tbl
WhenToTransferOutput = ON_EXIT
executable      = test.exe
output          = test.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
error           = test.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
log             = test.$(Cluster).log
