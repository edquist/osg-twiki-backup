---+++ Introduction to GIP Section

This section gives information about the options in the GIP section of the configuration file.

---+++ Options

The options given in bold type are mandatory.

| Option | Values Accepted | Explanation |
| *batch* | String | This should give the name of the batch system in use on this CE.  It should be one of pbs, fbs, sge, lsf, or condor. |
| *advertise_gums* | =True=, =False= | If you want GIP to query your gums server set this to True, otherwise set this to False. |
| *advertise_gsiftp* | =True=, =False= | If you want GIP to advertise your gridftp server set this to True, otherwise set this to False. |
| gsiftp_host  | String | This should be set to the name of the gridftp server GIP will advertise if the advertise_gridftp setting is set to True. |
| gsiftp_path  | String | This is the location on the gsiftp server that incoming data can be placed in. This should should be set to OSG_DATA if your gsiftp server is your CE. |
| vo_dir | String | This directory will give the suffix that should be applied to the se_root_path  setting above.   If you enabled the simplified_srm setting, set  this to the path that all VOs should use. If you are using VO specific directories, enter the path that VOs should use, PLEASE NOTE: VONAME in the path will be replaced with the VOs actual name.  The VOs that will be advertised are obtained from the osg-user-vo-map.txt file. E.g. if you are enabled the simplified_srm setting and set se_root_path to /pnfs/myhost/data and set this setting to vo_location, then the path used by VOs would be /pnfs/myhost/data/vo_location |
| special_vo_dir | String | This option allows directories for specific VOs to be entered directly.  This should be done using the following format: vo1:/vo1/dir,vo2:/vo2/dir  | 
|srm|True, False|This setting indicates whether you have a SE associated with this CE whose information you would like GIP to publish. Set this to True or False.|
|se_name|String|If you want GIP to publish on your SE, then you should fill in the registered OSG name of the SE in the next setting (e.g. UC_ITB_SE) . If srm is set to True, then this is required.|
|se_host|String|If srm is set to True, then this should be set to the hostname of your SE.|
|srm_implementation|String|If srm is set to True, then this setting should have the SRM implementation that you are using (e.g. dcache, bestman, etc)|
|dynamic_dcache|True, False|If you are using a dcache based se, GIP can query it dynamically to obtain the values it should advertise, however you'll need to do some other configuration in order to accomplish this See https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/InformationServices/DcacheGip if you have enabled this setting. This should be set to True or False.|
|srm_version|String|If you are advertising a SE through GIP, this setting should have the version of your srm implementation (e.g. 1.8.0-12pl4)|
|se_access_number|Integer|This setting gives the number of gsiftp access points available for your SE|
|se_access_version|String|Set this to the protocol version that should be used to access your SE. Set to 1.0.0 for gsiftp and 2.0.0 for gsiftp2 . This should probably be set to 1.0.0|
|se_access_endpoints|String|Set this option to the urls endpoints of your SE's gsiftp servers separated by commas if you have multiple servers (e.g. gsiftp://ftp.host1:port,gsiftp://ftp.host2:port)|
|se_control_version|String|Set this setting with the protocol version that your SE supports e.g. 1.1.0, 2.2.0|
|se_root_path|String|Set this to the path to the base path to your SE's storage area. E.g. /pnfs/your.site/data|
|simplified_srm|True, False|If you want all VOs to use a single path on your SE enable this setting below, otherwise set this to False|

For each subcluster, enter cluster information by creating a new Subcluster section with a unique name in
the following format:  [Subcluster CHANGEME] where CHANGEME is the globally unique subcluster name.  All
the information contained in the options should be for the worker nodes in the cluster.  The information
needed is:

|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation |
|*name*|string|This is the same name that is in the Section label.  It should be globally unique|
|*node_count*|Integer|This is the number of worker nodes in the subcluster|
|*ram_mb*|Integer|Megabytes of RAM per node.|
|*cpu_model*|String|CPU model, as taken from /proc/cpuinfo.  Please, no abbreviations!|
|*cpu_vendor*|String|Vendor's name: AMD, Intel, or ??|
|*cpu_speed_mhz*|Integer|Approximate speed, in MHZ, of the chips|
|*cpus_per_node*|Integer|Number of CPUs (physical chips) per node|
|*cores_per_node*|Integer|Number of cores per node|
|*inbound_network*|True, False|Set to true or false depending on inbound connectivity.  That is, external hosts can contact the worker nodes in this subcluster based on their hostname.|
|*outbound_network*|True, False|Set to true or false depending on outbound connectivity.  Set to true if the worker nodes in this subcluster can communicate with the external internet.|

For each storage element, add a new SE section.  Each SE name must be unique for the entire grid, so make sure to not
pick anything generic like "MAIN".  Each SE section must start with the words "SE", and cannot be named "CHANGEME".

There are two main configuration types; one for dCache, one for BestMan.

For BestMan-based SEs:
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|*name*|String|Name of the SE - set to be the same as the OIM registered name|
|*srm_endpoint*|String|The endpoint of the SE.  It MUST have the hostname, port, and the server location (/srm/v2/server in this case).  It MUST NOT have the ?SFN= string.|
|*provider_implementation*|String|Set to: 'bestman'|
|*implementation*|String|Set to: 'bestman'|
|*version*|String|Version number; the "bestman" provider implementation will attempt to auto-detect this also.|
|*default_path*|String|Default paths for all of your VOs; VONAME is replaced with the VO's name.|
|*use_df*|True, False|Set to TRUE if the bestman provide can use 'df' on the directory referenced above to get the freespace information.  If set to false, it probably won't detect the correct info.|

For dCache-based SEs:
|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|*name*|String|Name of the SE - set to be the same as the OIM registered name|
|*srm_endpoint*|String|The endpoint of the SE.  It MUST have the hostname, port, and the server location (/srm/managerv2 in this case).  It MUST NOT have the ?SFN= string.|
|*provider_implementation*|String|set to 'dcache' for dcache 1.8 (additional config is required), 'dcache19' for dcache 1.9, or 'static' for default values.   If you use the dcache provider, see http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/InformationServices/DcacheGip.  If you use the dcache19 provider, you must fill in the location of your dCache's information provider|
|infoprovider_endpoint|String|Url to the dcache information provider|
|*implementation*|String|set to: 'dcache'|
|*version*|String|dCache version; non-static providers will also attempt to auto-detect this.|
|*default_path*|String|Default paths for all of your VOs; VONAME is replaced with the VO's name.|

If you want to restrict the advertisement of particular storage spaces in dcache to particular VO's, add the following 
settings to the dCache SE section:

|Option|Values Accepted|Explanation|
|spaces|String|comma delimitted list of all the spaces that should be restricted by VO|
|space_CHANGEME_vos|String|Create one of these settings for each space listed in spaces.  CHANGEME is one of the space names in the list specified in spaces.  The value should be a comma delimitted list of VO's for this particular storage space|
