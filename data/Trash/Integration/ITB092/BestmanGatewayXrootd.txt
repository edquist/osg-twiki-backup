 !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd  implements SRM v2.2 for generic posix file systems and provides storage that spans on multiple file systems. The installation of !BeStMan  in “full mode” on top of  the existing FS might be sufficient for small sites [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/DocumentationAboutStorageElements  OSG Storage Documentation]] 
 
The configuration of this distributed storage is pretty complicated, so we will not be able to provide automatic configuration scripts for all options available for each components for the time being. The goal of this document is to give enough information for system administrators to do initial simple configuration of the storage as well as provide references to the documents that 
may help to accomplish more sophisticated configuration. 
%EDITTHIS%

---++ Proposed Architecture 
 
!BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd storage consists of the following components: 
   *  FUSE -   [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net File System in User Space]] is required for !XrootdFS 
   * !XrootdFS -  is a Posix filesystem for an Xrootd storage cluster ([[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/xrootdfs.html XrootdFS Home Page]] ), is required for !BeStMan, !GridFTP to work with  Xrootd  
   * !BeStMan-gateway is a partial implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by LBNL, for disk based storage systems maintenance ( [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman BeStMan HomePage]] ) 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer ( [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp GrdiFTP Documentation]] ) 
   * Xrootd   provides POSIX-like access to files and their enclosing directory namespace ( [[http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/papers/Scalla-Intro.htm Xrootd Home Page]] )

---++ Configuration decisions 
 
The following questions should be answered before you can proceed with installation and configuration of !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd storage solution: 
 
Q. _How many nodes could be used for storage?_
 
      The absolute minimum number of nodes is 3: 
   1. !BeStMan, !XroodFS, FUSE, !GridFTP  
   1. Xrootd redirector 
   1. Xrootd data server node 
Usually one would prefer to separate !GridFTP from !BeStMan for better 
performance.   More machines could be added as Xrootd data server nodes or 
!GridFTP servers. The decision should be based on your load and storage 
requirements.  Below, we lay out a few tips on deciding your site deployment:

   * If your site will be allowing VOs to do heavy data movement (dedicated or opportunistic), you should have a node dedicated to !BestMan.  At the time of this writing, the VOs that use storage heavily are CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0.
      * If you serve one of the above VOs and have more than 250 cores, you should *definitely* have a dedicated !BestMan node.
   * If your site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space, you should have a node dedicated to !BestMan.
   * If none of the above apply, you can co-locate !BestMan and your !GridFTP server on the same node.
   * If you have less than 1Gbps bandwidth to your site, then you need only one !GridFTP server - at most, 2 servers will be needed.
   * If you have more than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one !GridFTP server per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the server) if you want to maximize throughput.  If you do not have 10Gbps interfaces, make sure you have roughly 1.5 Gbps of network interface cards per 1 Gbps of WAN bandwidth.  In this case, you should not co-locate your !GridFTP and !BestMan server.

If you have absolutely no idea what your site's usage will be, we recommend 1 server (!BestMan + !GridFTP combined) for 0-200 cores, one to two dedicated !GridFTP servers for 200 - 500 cores, and 2 to 10 dedicated !GridFTP servers for over 500 cores, depending on your site's load.
 
Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_ 
 
You have to decide if you want to use grid-map-file or !GUMS server for users’ 
authentication and authorization. 
More details about !GUMS could be found at 
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS  GUMS Documentation]]

 Q. _Do you need to support space tokens?_
  
!BeStMan-gateway supports predefined, static space tokens that should be 
included in configuration. It doesn't keep trace or enforce static space tokens.  If 
you want partition your storage space and have a “designated” space for some 
VOs or users you can choose to use space tokens. You will have to decide the 
names and descriptions of the tokens as well as the size of the area. This 
information will be used in !BeStMan configuration, and Xrootd server 
configuration on data server and redirector nodes. 

%ICON{"warning"}% Due to the current limitation of Xrootd the maximum length of space token name is 15 characters!

 
Q. _What is your Mount Point for !XrootdFS  on !BeStMan node?_
 
 You will need this information for !XrootdFS, !GridFTP and Xrootd configuration. 
 
Q. _How to partition storage areas on Xrootd redirector and data server nodes?_ 

Xrootd is using two storage areas. One storage area (referred as _storage_path) could be accessed by clients using xroot protocol. This area contains symbolic links to the data files that are located in the cache storage area (referred as  _storage_cache_).
The Xrootd developers recommended to use a separate partition for each storage area, but  in principal for _storage_path_ a directory can be used as well. In Xrootd 
production instillation at SLAC an ext3 partition is used for  _storage_path_. This storage area requires a significant amount of inodes. However, too many inodes 
means small block size. For real file, that means a limit of file size (though not clear about sym linked files, which are big in size but are filled with empty holes). At 
SLAC, the block size is set to 1k (thus put a limit of real file size at ~256GB). 
 

Q. _Do you want to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_

If you want to report all the transfers in and out of your storage you would need to install or enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes. More details should be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome  Gratia Home Page]]. The reported information will include the source and destination of transfer, certificate subject of transfer initiator, size and status of the transferred file.   
 
---++ VDT packages 
All the required components but FUSE can be installed from  [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/download.html VDT cache]]: 
 
   a. !BeStMan 
   a. !XrootdFS 
   a. Xrootd-GridFTP and !PRIMA (if you would like to use !GUMS as authorization server)  
   a. Xrootd
   a. Gratia gridftp-transfer probe  
   a. srm-lbnl-client 
Please follow the instructions provided on the VDT web page about how to download 
and install them. In this document we are using XXX to indicate current 
production version. 
 
You have to select the root directory for your installation of VDT packages.  In this 
document we will refer to this directory as $INSTALLATION_DIR. 

---++ !BeStMan-gateway installation and configuration 
 
!BeStMan, !XrootdFS  and !FUSE should be installed on same node. !BeStMan and !XrootdFS should be installed under the same directory. 

%ICON{"warning"}%The _storage_path_ is used throughout this document and it  refers to the path that has to be provided while accessing !BeStMan-gateway, !GridFTP, !Xrootdfs and Xrootd. For !XrootdFS the _storage_path_ is a !XrootdFS mount point that is mapped to  _&lt;xrdr_host&gt;:&lt;xrdr_port&gt;:storage_path_. On the node where !XrootdFS is installed you can access data files directly. For !GridFTP the _storage_path_ is virtual mount point that allows to redirect user requests to  _&lt;xrdr_host&gt;:&lt;xrdr_port&gt;:storage_path_.  The  _storage_path_ should be the same for !GridFTP and !XrootdFS in order for !BeStMan to operate correctly.
For Xrootd the _storage_path_ is a directory that client (user , !XrootdFS, !GridFTP) can access using xroot protocol directly. This directory contains the symbolic links to the actual data files that is stored in _storage_cache_ area (Xrootd cache partition that should exist on every Xrootd node).   

---+++ !FUSE 
!FUSE is a kernel module that intercepts and services user requests to the !XrootdFS.  

!FUSE can be installed via “yum install” or rpms. You will need three packages: 
   * fuse
   * fuse-libs
   * kernel-module-fuse

or you can download it  from   
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121684&package_id=132802 and build according to instructions  provided at http://fuse.sourceforge.net.   
 
You will need to have root access to install it. 
It is essential that FUSE version ( &gt; 2.7.3) and flavor match your kernel. Contact your sys admin if you have any questions.

---+++ Create an installation directory 
Create a directory, e.g.  /opt/%CACHE%-bestman. Make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 
We will refer to this directory as _&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_. 

---+++ !XrootdFS 
!XrootdFS is a Posix filesystem  that allows !GridFTP, !BeStMan and other grid applications to work with Xrootd storage system. !XrootdFS works on top of !FUSE. !XrootdFS can be installed from %CACHE% cache. The installation described here is done as root even though services does not  run as root:

    * A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed.
      Please answer y (yes) so that the software can be retrieved. 

<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
pacman -get %CACHE%:XrootdFS 
. setup.sh 
</pre>
 
 
In order to configure !XrootdFS you will need to do the following: 
<pre class="screen">
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_xrootdfs \ 
 --user &lt;user&gt; \ 
 --cache &lt;storage_path&gt; \ 
 --xrdr-host &lt;hostname&gt;  \ 
 --xrdr-storage-path &lt;storage_path&gt;
</pre>
 
Where _$VDT_LOCATION_  is a directory where the package is installed,<br/> 
_user name_ of the non-privileged user that runs xrootdfs daemon and  is an owner of <br/>
_hostname_ is a FQDN of Xrootd redirector host <br/> 
_storage_path_ is  a !XrootdFS mount point that will be created for you  and storage area on redirector node  <br/> 

---+++ !BeStMan-gateway 
 
!BeStMan-gateway is a generic SRM v2.2 load balancing frontend for GridFTP servers. It is developed by the Scientific Data Management Group of Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory. It implements a subset of SRM v2.2 specifications that includes: 
   * !srmPing() 
   * !srmGetTransferProtocols() 
   * !srmLs()  
   * !srmRm()  
   * !srmMkdir()  
   * !srmRmdir() 
   * !srmPrepareToPut()  
   * !srmPrepareToGet()  
   * !srmPutDone()  
   * !srmReleaseFiles()  
   * !srmGetSpaceTokens() 
   * !srmGetSpaceMetaData()  
Some of the abovementioned specs are just partially implemented. 
For more information see [[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/bestman-gateway.html BeStMan-gateway Home Page]]
 
!BeStMan can be installed from %CACHE% cache in the same directory where !XrootdFS has been  already installed (see !XrootdFS installation). The installation described here is done as root even though services does not  run as root:

    * A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed.
      Please answer y (yes) so that the software can be retrieved. 
      
You have to decide what authorization mechanism you will use, if you want to use gridmap-file generated from VOMS servers, you should answer  _y_ (yes) to the following question:
 <pre class="screen">
Do you want edg-mkgridmap daemon to be run via cron? [y/n] y
</pre>

If you want to use GUMS you should answer _n_ (no)  to that question. Also, if you are using GUMS you should setup environment variable before you start the installation:. 
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt;GUMS hostname&gt;      # if you want to use GUMS for GridFtp and Gratia GridFTP probe authorization
pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman 
 . setup.sh 
</pre>
 
Follow the instructions provided in _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README_ to configure CA package updates.


---++++ Configuring !BeStMan-gateway 
You will need to configure !BeStMan to enable gateway-mode. In gateway-mode !BeStMan is not managing your disk but rather relies on !Xrootd to do so. You have to 
choose what authorization mechanism to use. Also, you have to decide if you would like 
to use static space token reservation, and in this case to come up with a list of token 
names, description and size of space allocated for each token. 
 
The example below shows how to configure !BeStMan in gateway-mode, enable !GUMS
and space token usage: 
<pre class="screen">
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y \ 
 --user &lt;user&gt; \ 
 --cert  &lt;service_cert&gt; \ 
 --key   &lt;service_key&gt; \ 
 --http-port  &lt;public_port&gt; \  
 --https-port  &lt;secured_port&gt; \ 
 --gums-host  &lt;GUMS hostname&gt; \ 
 --gums-port  &lt;GUMS port number&gt; \ 
 --use-xrootd  \ 
 --with-tokens-list  "&lt;TOKEN_1_NAME&gt;[desc:&lt;TOKEN_1_DESC&gt;][&lt;TOKEN_1_SIZE_GB&gt;];&lt;TOKEN_2_NAME&gt;[desc:&lt;TOKEN_2_DESC&gt;][&lt;TOKEN_2_SIZE&gt;]"   \ 
 --with-transfer-servers &lt;GridFTP server list&gt;
</pre> 

Where  _user_ name of the non-privileged user that runs !BeStMan,</br>  
_service_cert_  path to service certificate (the certificate file should belong to the _user_)<br/>
_service_key_  path to service certificate private key (the certificate key file should belong to the _user_). Currently some clients (lcg-utils tool) require that service certificate is a host certificate <br/>
_public_port_http_ public port (default : 10080;commonly used port is 8080 unless there is a conflict) <br/> 
_secured_port_http_ private port (default: 10443;commonly used port is 8443 unless there is a conflict) <br/> 
_GridFTP server list_  is FQDN of your !GridFTP servers,  <br/>  
_GUMS hostname_ the name of  !GUMS server, <br/>  
_GUMS port number_ the port of !GUMS  server,   <br/>  
_Client DN for GUMS interface_ is  a service certificate subject. <br/>  
<pre class="screen">
openssl x509 -subject -noout -in &lt;service_cert&gt; 
</pre>
token list example: <br/>
"ATLASDATADISK[desc:ATLASDATADISK][40000];ATLASPRODDISK[desc:ATLASPRODDISK][30000];ATLASGROUPDISK[desc:ATLASGROUPDISK][30000]"

_GridFTP server list_  is a list !FQDN of your !GridFTP servers, separated by ; . e.g. 
“gsiftp://host1.domain.tld;gsiftp://host2.domain.tld” <br/> 
 
If you want to use grid-map-file for user authentication and authorization do not specify 
the following options: </br>  
--gums-host   </br>  
--gums-port </br>  
   
 
If you do not want to use statically reserved space tokens do not specify the following 
options: </br>  
--with-tokens-list 
 
Please, make the appropriate modification to _/etc/sudoers_ described in !BeStMan 
documentation, namely add the following lines to this file: 
<pre class="screen">
Cmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/ls 
Runas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root 
&lt;user_name&gt; ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD 
</pre>
Please keep in mind that this is just an example, you can choose more  be more restrictive policy for your site.



---+++ !GridFTP-Xrootd 
Generic !GridFTP server comes with  !BeStMan installation but you will need to install additional package in order for !GridFTP to work with !Xrootd. This package should be installed in the same directory where !BeStMan is installed.  

<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt;GUMS hostname&gt;  # if you are using GUMS for authorization 
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd-GridFTP 
. setup.sh
</pre>

Now, you have to configure  !GridFTP to work with !Xrootd

<pre class="screen">
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gridftp --use-xrootd \ 
 --xrootd-host &lt;hostname&gt; \ 
 --xrootd-mount-point &lt;storage_path&gt; \ 
 --xrootd-storage-path &lt;storage_path&gt; 
</pre>
Where _$VDT_LOCATION_ is a directory for !GridFTP installation,  <br/>
_hostname_ is a FQDN of the Xrootd redirector host,  <br/>
_storage_path_ is a !GridFTP virtual mount point and storage area on redirector node 

If you are using GUMS for authorization perform the following commands:
<pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre> 

If you are dealing with firewall the gridftp port range should be properly set. In order to do so you will have to modify _vdt-local-setup.sh_.
<pre class="screen">
#edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=&lt;low_port,high_port&gt;
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=&lt;low_port,high_port&gt;
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
</pre>

Where _low_port,high_port_ - controls all outbound globus connections for gridftp (e.g GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=40000,49150)
 
---+++ Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe
If you are using !GridFTP server that is installed during the !BeStMan installation you will need to enable, configure Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe and perform the actions described in
 [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]]


---++ Standalone !GridFTP-Xrootd 
If you want to use several !GridFTP servers (e.g for load balancing) you will need to install !GridFTP on each dedicated node. In order to that 
Create a directory, e.g.  /opt/%CACHE%-gridftp. Make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 
We will refer to this directory as _&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_. 
 
The installation described here is done as root:

    * A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed.
      Please answer y (yes) so that the software can be retrieved. If you do not want to use grid-map file to set up the mappings from global identities (user certificate names) to local accounts please answer n (no) to the following question:
<pre>
Do you want edg-mkgridmap daemon to be run via cron? [y/n] n
</pre>


<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt;GUMS hostname&gt;   # if you want to use GUMS for GridFTP authorization
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd-GridFTP
. setup.sh                          #DON'T forget to do that otherwise PRIMA will not work
pacman -get %CACHE%:Gratia-GridFTP
. setup.sh
</pre>
 
Where _GUMS hostname_ is a !GUMS server and   
_&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_  is a root directory of %CACHE% installation. 

Now, you have to configure  !GridFTP to work with !Xrootd:
<pre class="screen">
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gridftp --use-xrootd \ 
 --xrootd-host &lt;hostname&gt; \ 
 --xrootd-mount-point &lt;storage_path&gt; \ 
 --xrootd-storage-path &lt;storage_path&gt; 
</pre>
Where _$VDT_LOCATION_ is a directory for !GridFTP installation,  <br/>
_hostname_ is a FQDN of the Xrootd redirector host,  <br/>
_storage_path_ is a !GridFTP virtual mount point and storage area on redirector node 
 

Then copy two files from _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install_ to in _/etc/grid-security_: 
 
<pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>

Follow the instructions provided in _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README_ to configure CA package updates. 

If you are dealing with firewall the gridftp port range should be properly set. In order to do so you will have to modify _vdt-local-setup.sh_.
<pre class="screen">
#edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=&lt;low_port,high_port&gt;
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=&lt;low_port,high_port&gt;
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
</pre>

Where _low_port,high_port_ - controls all outbound globus connections for gridftp (e.g GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=40000,49150)
 
---+++ Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe
 You will need just to enable and configure Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe and perform the actions described in [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]]

---++ Xrootd data server node 
You will have to install Xrootd on each data server node. The installation described here is done as root even though services does not  run as root:

   1. Stop !XrootdFS,!GridFTP and !BeStMan. Login on !BeStMan node, then: <pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –off
</pre> 
   1. Stop standalone !GridFTP servers. Login on each !GridFTP server node, then: <pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –off
</pre>  
   1. Stop Xrootd redirector. Login on redirector node,  then: <pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –off
</pre> 
   1.. Stop Xrootd on all the data server nodes. Login on each Xrootd data server node, then: <pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –off
</pre> 

---++ System sanity check 
In order to verify that the system is functional you will need to download wn-client package. Create a directory, e.g.  /opt/%CACHE%-xrootd. Make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 
We will refer to this directory as _&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_.  

<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
pacman -get %CACHE%:wn-client
. setup.sh 
</pre>
You will need to get your _voms-proxy_ certificate:
<pre class="screen"> 
voms-proxy-init –voms &lt;voname&gt;:/&lt;voname&gt;
</pre>
 
Execute srm-ping: 
<pre class="screen">
 srm-ping srm://&lt;BeStMan_host&gt;:&lt;secured_port_http&gt;/srm/v2/server 
 </pre>
Expected results:
<pre class="screen">

If you have reasonable result you may try to srm copy. In order to do so create a file _test1_ in _/tmp_ directory and execute: 
<pre class="screen"> 
srm-copy   file:////tmp/test1 srm://&lt;BeStMan_host&gt;:&lt;secured_port_http&gt;/srm/v2/server\?SFN=&lt;storage_path&gt;/test1 -spacetoken &lt;TOKEN_1_NAME&gt;

If you turn on Gratia !GridFTP transfer probes you should be able to see the accounting information by accessing your Gratia collector. See details in  [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]].


 
---++ Troubleshooting – What could go wrong with such trivial tasks? 
 
If   sanity checks failed you would probably need to check the each component in order 
to verify what went wrong with your installation. In order to do so you should ,probably, 
check all them in the following order: 
   * Xrootd 
   * !XroodFS 
   * !GUMS (if in use) 
   * !GridFTP 
   * !BeStMan 

---+++ Verifying Xrootd 
Login on the node where you have installed !BeStMan, then 
<pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib 
export LD_PRELOAD=$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib/libXrdPosixPreload.so 
echo “This is a test” >/tmp/test 
cp /tmp/test xroot://&lt;XRDR_host&gt;:1094//&lt;XRDR_storage_path&gt;/test 
cp xroot://&lt;XRDR_host&gt;:1094//&lt;XRDR_storage_path&gt;/tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
</pre>

---+++ Verifying !XrootdFS 
Login on the node where you have installed !XrootdFS, then 
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;storage_path&gt;
echo “This is a test” >test1 
ls –l test1 
cat test1 
</pre>

---+++ Verifying !GUMS 
Make sure that the service certificate you are specified for !BeStMan  configuration with  
--cert &lt;service_cert&gt; , --key  &lt;service_key&gt;  options and !GridFTP service certificate are 
accepted by !GUMS  (see [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/notes/GUMS.html GUMS Installation Documentation]])   
 
Get mapping _uid_ for your certificate and verify that this _uid_ exists on !BeStMan and !GridFTP node. 
 
---+++ Verifying !GridFTP 
Login on the node where you have installed have your certificate installed and  access to %CACHE%:wn_client.

You will need to get your voms-proxy certificate: 
<pre class="screen">
voms-proxy-init –voms &lt;voname&gt;:/&lt;voname&gt; 
</pre>

Then test !GridFtp: 

<pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION 
. setup.sh 
echo “This is a test” >/tmp/test 
globus-url-copy -dbg file:///tmp/test gsiftp://&lt;GridFtp_host&gt;/tmp/test 
</pre>

---+++ Verifying !BeStMan
Make sure that !BeStMan is running and there is no error in the log file (_$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log_). Login on the node where you have installed !BeStMan then

<pre class="screen">
[root@cmswn085 itb_bestman]# ps auxww|grep $VDT_LOCATION/bestman|grep -v grep

|^|replace "xrd.port any" with a particular port in $VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg| |

---++ Log file and configuration locations 
 
If any of the tests described above have failed or you are just curious to see what’s going 
on you could find log and configuration files for each of the module in the following 
location on a relevant node: 
|*Module Name*|*Configuration files*| *Log files*| 
|!BeStMan| $VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc |$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log| 
|!GridFTP|$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/vdt-run-gsiftp.sh.env | $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log |
