 Generic Information Provider (GIP) Configuration

%EDITTHIS% 
%BR%

---++ dCache Provider
 The GIP has the ability to query dCache directly for its configuration, allowing admins to avoid hardcoding info. If you need to advertise a dCache storage element in your Generic Information Provider, please note that you need to follow the instructions at [[InformationServices.DcacheGip][dCache Information Provider]]

---++ PBS Provider
 By default, the GIP advertises that all PBS queues are available to all VOs. This is not correct at many sites - some queues might be VO specific, and some might be dedicated to local users. To correct this, PBS sites should refer to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/InformationServices/GipConf][GIP Configuration File]] to setup whitelisting and blacklisting for queues.

---++ More information
 More information about the Generic Information Provider can be found at GenericInformationProvider. Information found here include administrator overrides, removing GUMS status information being published through GIP, configuring GIP to not count VMs in "Owner" State in Condor Batch system, and adding site defined constraints.
