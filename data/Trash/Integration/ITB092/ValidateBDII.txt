Note:  This page refers to the ldapsearch command.  The ldapsearch command is not part of the standard OSG installation, it is commonly
on many standard linux installations. If you do not have it and would like to get it
from the VDT it is part of the VDT OpenLDAP package that can be pulled using pacman
and refer to the VDT Package 'OpenLDAP.'

---++ Validating BDII

   * Check the GIP validator 
      * http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu
      * http://is-itb2.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/status.cgi
   * Next check your system is reporting via:
<pre>
ldapsearch -x -LLL -p 2170 -h is-itb.grid.iu.edu -b mds-vo-name=YOUR_SITE_NAME_HERE,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
</pre>
   * If the information if not being reported correctly, run the following on your CE
<pre>
$VDT_LOCATION/gip/bin/gip_info
</pre>
If this information is correct, then your local GIP is configured correctly.
   * If your information is still not reported to BDII, you might have a problem with the CEMon publishing service. To troubleshoot your CEMon installation see the [[ResourceSelection.CEMonTroubleshootingGuide][CEMon troubleshooting guide]].
