---++ Featured tutorial: Connecting to OSG to analyze images (by Marco Mambelli)

Let's assume I have a lot of scientific data to analyze, e.g. I want to count the cells in many images stored on my computer, and I don't have the computing power to complete in a timely manner.
Opportunistic resources on Open Science Grid and some tools available to its community can help me get the task done.
In this tutorial I will show:
   * how to register on OSG Connect to get access to OSG resources
   * how to easily move your data so that it can be available on the Web and used by your jobs
   * how to install and use BOSCO to submit the python jobs and retrieve the results on your laptop or workstation

*Marco Mambelli* is a computer scientist in the University of Chicago. Mats is a PALMS and BOSCO developer, and leads OSG site coordination and support.
