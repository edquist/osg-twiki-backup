---++ Featured tutorial: Connecting to OSG to analyze images (by Marco Mambelli)

Let's assume you have a lot of scientific data to analyze, e.g. you want to count the cells in many images stored on your computer, and you don't have the computing power to complete in a timely manner.
Opportunistic resources on Open Science Grid and some tools available to its community can help me get the task done.
In this tutorial Marco will show:
   * how to register on OSG Connect to get access to OSG resources
   * how to easily move your data so that it can be available on the Web and used by your jobs
   * how to install and use BOSCO to submit the python jobs and retrieve the results on your laptop or workstation
Marco runs 100 jobs on OSG, each counting the cells on a different image, and at the end sums the results to find the total number of cells.

*Marco Mambelli* is a computer scientist in the University of Chicago. Mats is a PALMS and BOSCO developer, and leads OSG site coordination and support.
