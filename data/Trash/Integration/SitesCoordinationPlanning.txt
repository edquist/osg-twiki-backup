---++ Site Coordinators Meeting Input (July 30-31, 2007)
   * ITB mailing list is busy, and we should have a low-bandwidth channel with clear instructions for how to install the ITB, and when to do it. And the process of installing it needs to be simple.
   * Quarterly face to face meetings, with following format:
      * One day meetings, roughly noon-to-noon
      * Meeting location - Fermilab, for its centrality.  WH1W well-liked. *Don't use Curia II.*
      * Schedule tutorials on morning of first day
      * Lightning talks are good
      * Demand for remote video
      * Next meeting - early December 2007
   * Monthly telecons
      * Metrics review (Deputy Facility Coordinator)
      * Report from OSG Users  (OSG Users Coordinators)
      * Lightning talks
   * Concern about having too many meetings when we factor in the user group meetings (quite a few were interested in the user meeting) and the all-hands meeting. 
   * We should figure out when it's appropriate to co-locate the site admin meetings with other meetings.
   * osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org for communication

---++ Action Items
   * Follow-up on the issue Xin raised: representing logical and physical sitenames in the information and accounting services.
   * Establish "best practices" clearing house  (done, by Steve, see further his [[https://indico.fnal.gov/contributionDisplay.py?contribId=20&sessionId=15&confId=866][talk]])
   * Fix dates for next face-to-face meeting.
   * Encourage people to register to osg-sites.
   * Need a osg-sites-notify mail list for important communications (separate from discussion threads).
