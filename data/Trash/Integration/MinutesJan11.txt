This sounds like an Operations issue, but Alan would like to see if others in the Integration group have experience with this:

<pre>
These are actually OSG-specific problems with the currently distributed template at

http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/tarballs/vo-version/gums.template

and not GUMS software setup problems.  (Sorry, I should have been more clear about this.)

I have sent a message to John Weigand and Rob Quick to check on these, as below at the bottom of this message.  Wanted to see if anyone else in the ITB had encountered them and if so, what to do.
