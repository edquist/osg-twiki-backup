---++ SE validation
   * Need a clear SE validation table and methods.


---++ VO validation
   * Schedule, getting ready.

---++ Documentation
I'll (AH) plan to call in about 3:15 CDT.

   * Consider Anne's proposal,  DocsComm.AnnePre080Sandbox
   * I've had two people successfully use my "streamlined" guide to install a CE.  I'm starting to adapt it a bit, and include it in the 0_7 doc as an alternate guide for ITB testers to try (!CEInstallStreamlined). It will mostly consist of includes of standard or special "streamlined" pages.
   * I asked Forrest to coordinate with people putting together SE doc; apparently there's some dcache doc from DESY; Alan S will do bestman, I believe. Forrest will not write the doc, but may test and edit it and fill in the doc hub area appropriately to nav to it.

Updates to itb 0_7 doc:
   * took out essentially all text from ce install guide; it's just includes now
   * created new page: !OsgRegistration (needs to be put in doc table)
   * modified a few other pages just so headings work right
   * there's a commented out link to !DiscoveryServiceInstallation in ce install guide; not in doc table. Status?
   * updated !CESimpleTest, !CESoftWare, !CESiteAdminGuide, !ManagedFork per my email 8/6 3:07pm
   * per same email, in !PacmanInfo, under "unsupported platforms", check colon after "pretend-platform". Error?
