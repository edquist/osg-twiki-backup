   * Apologies: none

---++ ITB 0.7.0 background
   * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
   * ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable

---++ Broken things
   * From Tuesday's meeting (to follow-up)
      * osg-site-validate installs a development version of condor.  May or may not break something.  (=site-verify= still exists)
         * Condor-devel issues corrected in VDT 1.8.0d
         * Still have problems with site-validate tests
         * RSV will have a new name ( OSG-RSV )       
      * Jeff's sge issue
      * John W: Questions during install of managed-fork - enabling condor - being asked multiple times.  Alain investigating.
      * In Globus WS Gram init script - if you run a second time it causes vdt-control to fail - Alain will investigate.
   * New things
       * UW network down currently, should be back up soon
       * Documentation is confusing and has places where OSG is used instead of OSG, need more work on resolving general documentation information (macros or caveat to indicate that OSG references should be ITB for ITB install)

---++ Status and issues of core sites
   * FNAL
   * BNL 
   * UC - reconfiguring the installation to match the permanent values, expect complete by EOB.
   * CIT - still working on the dcache install, then ligo wf validation. will do itb 0.7.
   * LBNL - installed itb 07. next goal is to gums.
   * TTU
   * IUPUI-ITB
   * CIT-CMS - working on gums install (trying to do an upgrade from an O.6.0 install); will work on ITB later.
   * OU - upgrading from an old OSG install - looking good.  (RHEL5, too). 
   * Arvind's RHEL5 - problems are getting discussed, no resolution at the moment. 
   * Others?

---++ CE Validation
   * Status and review of validation methods.  Lets go across the table in ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable service by service.
   * Each site admin needs to go through and run validations themselves and mark it down in the table
   * William Law will be asked to help with validation tests with OSG integration services
   * ValBDII page correct, YOUR_SITE_NAME refers to the site name (e.g. UC_ITB )
      * %S% Aggregator needs to be updated with new schema, which is preventing interoperability and validation
      * BDII information is missing / not registering for some sites
   * William Law will take over GIP Validator code
   * Chris Green says that the Gratia Page is populated and ok
   * WS-GRAM page is complete except for a job with staging to verify WS-GRAM functionality
   * GUMS -- Jeff Porter will install and test / come up with a validation for it
      * %S% validation can be done by doing successful mapping either using the gums web interface and a mapping from the gateway or by a mapping from the gatekeeper and verifying it in the host log
      * maybe give example configurations and examples? 
   * %S% Syslog-ng -- Suchandra will populate today
   * RSV probes instructions are present
   * RSV infrastructure -- placeholder will be filled out later
   * VOMRS page has been filled out by Tanya
   * %S% VO Access will be populated by John
   * %S% Interoperability will be populated by Burt
   * Deadline of Wed to get validation updated and completed for sites

---++ Interoperability validation (Burt)
   * Basically making sure that jobs from glite system can send jobs to ITB sites
   * Should be relatively simple, making sure the glite wms jobs can be sent and run correctly
   * depends on information systems
   * storage validation is more complex
   * Alan Sill volunteered to learn how to submit glite jobs to OSG 
   * Work will progress in september when european members get back from vacation
   * Burt will send out a link to web page with contact string links that will get polled by LCG BDII

---++ SE validation
   * Need a clear SE validation table and methods.
   * Section on site validation page with storage information and validation
   * Not clear if any other tests other than srm tester are being done
   * Storage group will contact RobQ to get storage-verify code
   * Will add columns for protocol tests
   * Information on page for itb testers


---++ VO validation
   * Schedule, getting ready.
   * Abhishek will be working on this during this cycle as well
   * Will take about a week to get VOs engaged but after start up time, VOs should be good to go
   * Need to be careful to make sure that enough time is given for this validation after installfest and prior to the actual 0.8 release
   * VO validation is expected to take about 2 weeks
   * A few VOs would be willing to test SEs as well
   * VO validation exercise is usually limited to the persistent sites on ITB, thus waiting for more sites to join the 3 currently listed in the table

---++ Installfest Scheduling
   * Scheduled tentatively for Thursday
   * %S% Suchandra will email ITB list and get a rough headcount of the number of sites that will be participating

---++ Documentation
I'll (AH) plan to call in about 3:15 CDT.

   * Consider Anne's proposal,  DocsComm.AnnePre080Sandbox
   * I've had two people successfully use my "streamlined" guide to install a CE.  I'm starting to adapt it a bit, and include it in the 0_7 doc as an alternate guide for ITB testers to try (!CEInstallStreamlined). It will mostly consist of includes of standard or special "streamlined" pages.
   * I asked Forrest to coordinate with people putting together SE doc; apparently there's some dcache doc from DESY; Alan S will do bestman, I believe. Forrest will not write the doc, but may test and edit it and fill in the doc hub area appropriately to nav to it.

Updates to itb 0_7 doc:
   * took out essentially all text from ce install guide; it's just includes now
   * created new page: !OsgRegistration (needs to be put in doc table)
   * modified a few other pages just so headings work right
   * there's a commented out link to !DiscoveryServiceInstallation in ce install guide; not in doc table. Status?
   * updated !CESimpleTest, !CESoftWare, !CESiteAdminGuide, !ManagedFork per my email 8/6 3:07pm
   * per same email, in !PacmanInfo, under "unsupported platforms", check colon after "pretend-platform". Error?

---++ AOB
   * Gabrielle is working on a way of improving gums probes 
      * needs a new gums configuration template
      * will coordinate with Rob
