---++ OSG 1.0.1
   * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
   * Cache - everything is settled. 
   * configure-osg.py is okay in the production cache
   * CE install test - Suchandra testing, Tony; John has tested on 6 nodes.
   * VOMS and GUMS also installed.
   * SE install not been tested pre-release
   * updater script was used to update osg-client.
   

---++ Tests of the update scripts for old OSG 1.0.0 services
   * *last week*
      * Steve successfully tested the updater script on installs and tested the pacman -update on client
      * Robert ran into issues with manual update procedure on CE, will run the updater script and see if that those issues are still there
      * John ran into issues 
      * UC_ITB tested updater script, will test pacman -update procedure and revised updater script
      *  Iwona updated bestman storage process manually, and didn't run into problems
   * *this week*
      *  Iwona attempted this from the production OSG cache, but ran into problems due to a specific local hybrid setup - does not think it will be issue for standard install. The updater script assumes its installed by root or as single user.
      * Robert - tried on LIGO-CIT, ran into a problem with configure-osg.py. Was starting from an OSG 1.0.0, VDT 1.10.99u. Hmm.. perhaps not a standard OSG 1.0.0 install.  Alain will try to diagnose, make recommendations.  
      * We're not hearing enough success about OSG 1.0.0 upgrades to OSG 1.0.1 with the updater script. 


*PLAN*
   * Alain and Rob will update an existing OSG 1.0.0 installation to check.

      * deferred, pending new dCache.
