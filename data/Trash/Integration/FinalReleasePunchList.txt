   * Suspend ITB changes (IMO this should have happened last week, but should absolutely be stopped ASAP!)
   * Archive current production software cache
   * Create new software cache
   * Update pacman pointers to new cache
   * Suspend changes to the ITB documentation
   * Move to production documentation in twiki
   * Make release announcement (RSS/Mail)

Alain:

- Change CEMon subscription to be production server?

Finalize documentation
  - Do we have documentation on how to upgrade from an old VDT?
    I forget, but I think it might not be there, and it would be useful
    for folks. This is one thing we didn't test very much.

  - Has everything been looked at yet? Do we need a second read-over
    to make sure it all looks good?

vo-version-0.6
  - Do we need to any any new VOs to the vo-version package?

  - The vo-version package doesn't include the new comment
    format that include a voi and a voc for each VO. Should it?

WS GRAM
  - Publish WS GRAM port numbers (John Rosheck can do this).

Release notes
  - We should have release notes that tell people what is new in
    OSG 0.6.0. I haven't seen any.
