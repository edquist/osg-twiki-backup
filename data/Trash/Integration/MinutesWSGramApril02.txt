---++ Agenda

---++ Meeting consolidation
   * Everyone is fine with meeting on tuesdays at 3:30pm

---++ Further Testing (Jeff, Suchandra)
   * Will run globusrun-ws test with -batch option to see how that affects the naive test
   * An european middleware group experienced similar problems as the naive test (globusrun-ws) when benchmarking
   * Load issue with Jeff's testing where a linear increase in per job completion time as number of jobs increase
   * Argonne testing discovered that with the globusrun-ws tests increasing the file descriptor limit for the account running the globus container allowed the service to stay up
   * Need to investigate the file descriptor limit
   * Stu would like to see comparisons of David's test using gt2 and gt4   
   * Suchandra will rerun naive testing using increased file descriptors and with the batch type submit
   * Future testing should eventually include a combination of condor-g submits and globusrun submits simultaneous

---++ Improvements in GT4
   * Globus team is working on improving staging
   * Have seen some improvements

---++ Configuration (Suchandra)
   * Will try to incorporate assistance for ws-gram configuration into the osg configuration scripts.
