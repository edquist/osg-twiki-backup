   * Previous meetings: MeetingMinutes
   * ITB list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-int.html][archive]]
   * VTB list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-vtb.html][archive]]
   * Coordinates: 2:30pm Central, *1-510-665-5437  1212*

---++ Attending
   * Meeting attendees: Rob, Suchandra, Charles, Michael, Jeff, Anne, Alain, Ted, Arvind, Alan, Anand, Charles B, Tanya, !RobQ, Xin, !JohnW, Steve, Stu
   * Apologies: none

---++ VDT/VTB testing (Suchandra)
   * 4 VTB sites (UC, FNAL, LBNL, Caltech)
   * Suchandra notes there have been a minor change to the VTB packages.  One more change to handle CA certificate update package?   Alain notes there is an rpm for these, and a once-a-day mechanism to check.  This means you don't need to use pacman to do this - then you'll never be behind.  But what happens if you do a Pacman update? Suggest *putting the vdt updater in as a default.*
   * Suchandra would rather this go into configure-osg.
   * What other packages were missing?  osg-site-validate, and the gratia metric probe.
   * UC, LBL, CIT

---++ ITB Deployment Readiness (!RobQ)
   * UC, FNAL (gridex jobs failing), IU (gridex jobs succeeding), FNAL test install (condor-dev)
   * Would like change to configure-osg: change to pre-config addresses.
   * Rob needs to get into the RT system.
   * GUMS to be installed and tested (Alan).
   * Gratia collector is broken for the ITB (replication is not working).  A new instance will be set for the ITB.
      * The replication feature is broken in the current VDT.
      * Is the Gratia collector required in a CE install?  Chris Green things not.  (A couple of sites, UCSD and Cornell, have discussed having their own, and forwarding.)
   * BDII - will pair down to the.
   * Need a pacman package for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS.
   * ITB 0.7 release web: ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
   * Schedule: one more VTB rev, one more ITB rev.  Will send email. 

---++ ITB Validation (Jeff)
   * ValidationTestbed
   * Need to setup equivalent of Integration.SiteValidationTableITB052
   * Jeff will get this setup for ITB 070, and will bring Charles up to speed.
   * Will work on service validation links.
   * Need to check site names in the table.
   * Move to 0_7 web.

---++ RSV (Arvind)
   * http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/vdt-package.html
   * A little behind - pieces of the collection / scheduling infrastructure are not quite ready.  On VDT pieces, a new person is coming up to speed, expect to be done in a week.
   * Get into touch with Jeff.

---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS (Tanya)
   * Is providing documentation.  
   * We need to get another site outside of Fermilab to test.

---++ GUMS
   * John Hover will work on documentation changes.   Jay will update in the near term.
   * TTU, UC, CIT at least, will be testing.

---++ OSG SE: SRM/dCache (Ted)
   * Links are on the webpage for ITB testing for SRM-dCache.
   * Alan will get the bestman links into the ITB page.

---++ Documentation (Anne)
I need some feedback for me to move ahead.  See my emails of 8/6 3:07 and 8/8 4:16pm.  Main issues:
   * reviews of my proposed changes to several docs in release doc table
   * page template (blank? add search?)  *leave it for now*
   * Will put *search* functionality on each page.  *Try out.*
   * doc-by-function table -- proceed as in Trash.DocumentationSiteFunctionTable, or better way? 
   * Charles Bacon - notes that in Globus project experience you need good underlying structure.  Impose order from the top down. 

Also: 
   * can I go into ITB 070 docs and alter/replace them at this stage? Yes %Y%
   * can you suggest a site admin to consult on Documentation/AdminDocCE?
   * ditto (but VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo admin) for Documentation/VoManageDocHub

*Provid

---++ WS gram testing update (Suchandra)
   * A lot of benchmarks performed in the last week.  gt4 out-performing gt2, significantly, but checking results.


---++ ITB Site readiness (Site admins)
 *TO UPDATE:*
   * !FermiGrid
      * Up now, and will pacman-update tomorrow, SE will be dcache 1.7 (existing).
   * BNL is setting up a ITB testbed (gateway, 5 worker nodes, 50GB dcache SRM)
      * hardware set up and waiting for software 
      * SRM testbed ready by end of next week, 16 TB Sun thumper (still working on this);  will also worker nodes.
   * UC
      * Ready to go - mid week.
      * Will setup dcache srm; reconfigure pbs to use compute nodes. 
   * CIT
      * Next week. One gk, 5 wn, FC4.
   * LBNL
      * VTB site will be re-used as ITB site; 1 gk and three wn.  Potentially another cluster?
   * OU
      * ITB cluster - 8 node, 1 gk.  *Ready - tomorrow, or monday*.
   * TTU
      * 1 gk, 2 dual cpu nodes; srm-bestman (VDT, no ITB cache): done %Y%.  *Ready tomorrow.*
   * IU

---++ Carry over from last meeting 
   * Storage verify script. This was done by John R in the past; Arvind will check with !RobQ. 
   * Is this replaced by the srm-tester?  (Note there is no storage testing in RSV - this will be in the next round.)
