---++ Motivation
This proposal is to remove the =condor_location= and =condor_config= settings from the =Managed Fork= section in the config.ini.  These settings aren't actually used by managed fork and are just used to populate the =OSG_CONDOR_LOCATION= and =OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG=.  However, these setting may not actually be needed for managed fork to work.  Removing these settings will reduce the potential for confusion and simplify the config.ini file.

---++ Scope
The =condor_config= and =condor_location= settings will not be required any location.

---++ Effects
Admins currently setting these values will be get a warning indicating that these settings are no longer being used and will be ignored.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.8. 

---++ Current Status
Posted to osg-int for discussion.
