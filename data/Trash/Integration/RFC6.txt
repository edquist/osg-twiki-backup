---++ Motivation
This proposal is to remove the =condor_location= and =condor_config= settings from the =Managed Fork= section in the config.ini.  These settings aren't actually used by managed fork and are just used to populate the =OSG_CONDOR_LOCATION= and =OSG_CONDOR_CONFIG=.  However, these setting may not actually be needed for managed fork to work.  Removing these settings will reduce the potential for confusion and simplify the config.ini file.

---++ Scope
The =condor_config= and =condor_location= settings will not be required any longer.

---++ Effects / Changes
The two settings will be made optional.  The default =config.ini= will no longer include these settings.  If they are included, =configure-osg= will generate a message at the =WARNING= level indicating that they will be ignored.  The settings will be retained in case VDT supports using a condor instance different from the instance used for the cluster for managed fork jobs.

---++ Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.9 

---++ Current Status
Approved and planned for OSG 1.2.9.
