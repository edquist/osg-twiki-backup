---++ WS Gram testing

From Stu:

   1 Martin ran 2000 job test to new GRAM service with local RFT calls on edge5 from osg-test2 (UNL submit host).  Ran quick without error.  PRIMA seemed to slow down the service.  Question is by how much?  How much does local calling improve gram performance on edge5? Try testing that service from all client submit hosts: Jeff, Suchandra.

   2 Condor folks (Jaime Frey) gave us a new condor-g version that should improve performance further.  3 calls in one.  Create(), set lifetime() and release() are now done in just the one create() call.  Should show improvement.  Martin will do an sanity test checking reliability and performance and then we can all try it out.
   3 Martin is working on GridFTP connection caching in RFT.  Hoping to have that done this week yet.  Should provide additional GRAM4 performance improvements.


Notes:
   * Replacing jars on the uct3-edge5 ws gram host resulted in better performance, and a scale of 2000 with no errors! 
   * These improvements will go into the next Globus release, 4.0.5.  Definitely we need to get this in time for OSG 0.8.
   * Need to reproduce "job-type" menu of tests (Jeff, Suchandra) and produce a new set of plots.

---++ Next VTB cycle
   * UC, LBL, and IU will contribute to the next cycle.
   * Suchandra will send a note to the VTB list when to install.

---++ AOB
    * John still working on storage-verify.  Will send email summarizing the remaining issues to the storage and GIP folks.
