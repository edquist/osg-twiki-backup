---+!! %SPACEOUT{ "Using syslog-ng with stunnel" }%
%TOC%

Here are sample instructions for securing syslog-ng using stunnel for OSG. Additional examples are 
http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_create_a_logserver_with_syslog-ng and
http://www.stunnel.org/examples/syslog-ng.html
These instructions assume that you do not wish to modify the system /etc/stunnel/stunnel.conf file.

First install stunnel4 package, eg:
<pre  class="screen">
apt-get install stunnel4
</pre>

Next create stunnel certificates on the server host:

<pre  class="screen">
cd /etc/grid-security
cat hostcert.pem hostkey.pem > stunnel.pem
chmod 600 /etc/grid-security/stunnel.pem

# copy hostcert to client host
scp hostcert.pem YOURCLIENT:/opt/vdt/stunnel/syslog-ng-server.pem
</pre>

The on the client host:

<pre  class="screen">
cd /etc/grid-security
cat hostcert.pem hostkey.pem > stunnel.pem
chmod 600 /etc/grid-security/stunnel.pem

# copy hostcert to the server (or email them to server admin)
scp  hostcert.pem  server-host:
cat client-cacert.pem >> /opt/vdt/stunnel/syslog-ng-client.pem
</pre>

Then create /opt/vdt/stunnel/stunnel.conf files.

Client side:
<pre  class="screen">
pid = /opt/vdt/tmp/stunnel4.pid
client = yes
cert = /etc/grid-security/stunnel.pem
# use this to verify who you are sending too
CAfile = /opt/vdt/stunnel/syslog-ng-server.pem
verify = 3

[grid_logs]
accept = 127.0.0.1:1999
connect = serverhost:5101
</pre>

Server side:
<pre  class="screen">
pid = /opt/vdt/tmp/stunnel4.pid
cert = /etc/grid-security/stunnel.pem
# the following 2 lines ensure identity of which hosts are sending you logs
CAfile = /opt/vdt/stunnel/syslog-ng-client.pem
verify = 3

[grid_logs]
accept = serverhost:5101
connect = 127.0.0.1:1999
</pre>


Then add something like this to the syslog-ng.conf file on the sending hosts:
<pre  class="screen">
# where to send the logs. stunnel will forward these to the host defined in the stunnel.conf
destination remote {tcp("127.0.0.1" port(1999));};
# connect your system log sources to the remote server
log {source(src);destination(remote);};
</pre>


and add something like this to the syslog-ng.conf file on the receiving hosts:
<pre  class="screen">
# where to find the logs that stunnel will get from the clients.
source secure_log {tcp(ip("127.0.0.1")  port(1999));}
log {source(secure_log); destination(remote);};
</pre>


Finally, restart syslog-ng and stunnel on both the server and clients.

<pre  class="screen">
stunnel4 /opt/vdt/stunnel/stunnel.conf  # write a boot script to do this
/etc/init.d/syslog-ng restart
 </pre>
Also add a boot script for stunnel.

If you are using TCP-wrappers, you may need to add the following to /etc/hosts.allow:

<pre  class="screen">
# clients:
1999:127.0.0.1 : ALLOW

# server:
5101:list of clients : ALLOW
</pre>

To test if it worked:
<pre  class="screen">
logger -u /tmp/syslog-ng-test "test message"
 </pre>

-----

---++ Simplified Verison

If you don't care about verifying the send or receive hosts, but only care about encrypting the data, you can simplify
things as follows:

Just remove the 'CAfile =' and 'verify =' lines from the stunnel config files, and you dont have to worry about copying certs
between client and server.
