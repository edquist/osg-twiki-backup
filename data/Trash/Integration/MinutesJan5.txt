---++ Further reports on OSG 0.3.4 validation

   * Resources which are using this release
      * t2dev-osg.uchicago.edu - marty dipple at uchicago.  Marty - we still need to get our gridmap file generated correctly, and a problem with GRIS, problem with the Condor manager (fixed), configure 
      * UC_Teraport - Gregg Cross.  ivdgl, mis, 
      * UIOWA-ITB rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu:
         * everyting working okay.
         * now starting the pre-release production installation (0.4)
         * Ransom is continuing to improve the validation page. Note - server for this is down at the moment due to maintenance. 
      * ITB_INSTALL_TEST  cmssrv09.fnal.gov - nothing new, nightlies going fine
      * OUHEP - Horst is still in Germany.
      * fnalgpfarmtest (Steve) red in gridcat at the moment.
      * Caltech (Kent, David) GridEx working and GridCat.
      * Texas tech - just completed an install and testing
      * Chris Purdue - got ITB box up and running, no problems with the install
      * Burt - no issues, now going on with 0.4.0 release for provisioning
      * iuatlas - installed and running atlas jobs.


   * OSG Client package issue - Burt
      * doesnt work on an x86-64bit machine for voms-client
      * problem is just in vdt-client - Burt working this with VDT on this.  Marco says Tim thinks this will get resolved in VDT 1.3.10.  voms 1.6.10 compiling correctly - now doing functional testing.

   * Issue during VDT ou
      * ML running as a daemon requires a directory for rsa keys, not an issue with an ml account.

     
   * Applications tested on the resources installed with this release
      * USCMS - Sample jobs run ok, next week full chain.. don't think its necessary, but won't happen for 0.4.0
      * Atlas - Yuri is running using GridCat information
      * LIGO - Kent: having trouble getting the application to run. Haven't had a chance to resolve issues.  0.3.1 did work, after the optional install of vds. Changed the client, made minor changes to the application.  Working with a dataset 1/4 size as before. 40% of jobs are failing.  Need more time to work it out.  David: 700 DAG nodes, using everyting out of the current cache, on both client and server side.  Need to test and recompile a number of things.  some concern about using FC4 on client side.  Have the VDS versions changed between OSG 0.3.1 and 0.3.4? (They are.) Kent would like to run on other systems besides the Caltech site, for the validation.  They involve more than the transfer process.
      * SDSS - running on the cluster at fnal, using the previous release. Tests at UCSD for data access using using client.
      * STAR - no attempts made, in the plan.
      * iVDGL - none that we are aware of.
      * GADU - no report.
      * GRASE - no report.

   * Monitoring systems for this release
      * [[http://osg-itb.grid.iu.edu/][OSG ITB GridCat]]
      * [[http://madman.uits.indiana.edu:8888][OSG ITB MonaLisa]]
      * ACDC [[http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/operations-dashboard.php?grids=2&vos=11][ Operations Dashboard]]
      * BDII [[http://goc.grid.sinica.edu.tw/gstat/OSG/][GSTAT OSG informaiton from OSG ITB BDII]]


---++ BDII

   * Any clarification needed for BDII registration and validation.
   * Will use the Iowa validation to keep track of sites, and add to the BDII. How many sites are reporting (8 sites reporting)?  Anything in GridCat.
   * Brief discussion of use of BDII to get attributes for job submission.  Eg, vds-getsites.
   * Ransom has an example program to get attributes from BDII.
   * Leigh - there is an issue of integration with EGEE - setup a separate instance for OSG only. Setup a second for LCG polling.  Need to work on this in deployment, to see if this is the right path for interoperability.  What about Teragrid? They don't have an analogous index service, they use Inca.  The core issue is routing of jobs through resource brokers.

---++ Documentation

   * LocalStorageConfiguration
   * LocalStorageRequirements

No significant documentation issues. Provisioning documenation (Burt):

   * This past week migration of documentation for provision has started.
   * There is a fine grained detailed list.
   * Rob Q, John W, Burt assigned as reviewers of the documentation.
   * A number documents are now being collected: Provisioning.ProvisioningDocs0dot4
   * Storage is the most difficult and complex.
   * Need volunteers for effort!


---++ GridEx

   * Status of GridEx VO registration. 

Have not had an operations meeting to add GridEx to the vo modules file. Need a privilege page with VOMS information, Rob Q is checking the ticket. When package is updated will notify to the support centers, with an cc to the ieb.


---++ Issues for Provisioning

   * Last time we needed clarification on a number of points that were provisioning-specific, such as which versions of OSG-level servers to deploy (eg. Monalisa).
   * ACDC and Monalisa are set with the versions we have now, just different respositories are used.
   * GridCat - Bockjoo is going to release an 0.9.0 version.  Note - these are fairly orthogonal, except for the MIS-CI. 
   * Other things - elements of the software stack have not been fully validated - 32bit client tools (Rob Q and Burt is working on this). 
   * Storage element validation - need script to validate the SE information.  Shoawen working on this - static information is available, but not the dynamic information.  So validation page already includes this, all okay.  Burt will use a production SE at fermilab with the GIPs from his ITB install, and push up to GridCat, and then put on the GIP validation page. 
   * Greg sent information about SE on Teraport to Mark - no results yet.
   * Almost all issues are documentation at this point.

---++ AOB
 
   * Stu: ws-gram installations? how to discover?  In GridCat there is the grid version field which sometimes reports this.


---++ Next Meeting

   * We will meet next week to clean up remaining details, and use the remaining time for provisioning.
