---++Introduction

This document describes how users can use an OSG CE and discover its features.

REMEMBER: In OSG not all CEs will offer the same features in terms of disk space

---++Possibilities

A definition of the concepts used in this document can be found in LocalStorageRequirements, including a [[LocalStorageRequirements#Minimum_requirements][section]] describing which are the possible minimum features available (different alternatives possible).

You will always be provided a WN_TMP area where you will have to put your current working directory (possibly in a unique subdirectory to avoid conflicts with other jobs running on the same host). 

You will have to define your favorite way of working and possibly be ready to adopt alternatives if that is not available.

The path/URL of CE storages can be provided to you in different ways:

	* <b>Environment Variables:</b>

		Well defined environment variables that resolve to the correct path or URL. Starting from VDT-1.3.8, these variables will be automatically propagated into the worker node environment (User does not need to source any file).  %RED% (There are bugs in this 
script at the moment, not working as of 12/8/05 OSG 0.3.3  S. Timm) %ENDCOLOR%  The environment 
variables that will eventually be defined are found in =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-attribute.conf=.
Below is a section of a sample =osg-attribute.conf= where these variables are defined:  (Example from FNAL_GPFARM_TEST). For instructions on how to run this script to configure this file, see LocalStorageConfiguration

=OSG_SITE_NAME="FNAL_TEST_033"=

=OSG_LOCATION="/export/osg/grid"=

=OSG_GRID="/usr/local/osg"=

=OSG_APP="/app"=

=OSG_DATA="/data"=

=OSG_SITE_READ="dcap://fndca.fnal.gov:24525//pnfs/fnal.gov/usr"=

=OSG_SITE_WRITE="dcap://fndca.fnal.gov:24525//pnfs/fnal.gov/usr"=

=OSG_WN_TMP="$_CONDOR_SCRATCH_DIR"=

=OSG_DEFAULT_SE="UNAVAILABLE"=

=OSG_SITE_INFO="http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/gpfarm/FNAL_GPFARM_POLICY.html"=

(Editors note--I have not yet checked that the syntax of the =OSG_SITE_READ= and =OSG_SITE_WRITE=
variables is correct,  S. Timm 12/08/2005)

	* <b>Information System (eg. GIP and BDII) </b>

		Path or URLs consistent across the CE (headnodes and WN), published using an information system (e.g. GIP and BDII)
	
	* <b>GridCat (DEPRECATED) </b>

		It is still possible but DEPRECATED (will be removed from future versions) the use of !GridCat Web pages or	!DataBase

	* <b>Self Discovery (DEPRECATED)</b>

		The use of self discovery looking for files like =osg-info.conf=. These internal mechanisms may change across releases and users cannot count on them.

---++Examples

---++Contributed Examples
Here OSG users can contribute (writing it or linking it) a description of their application and how it is using CE local storage. These may include specific references that may not apply to any other application.
