---++ General validation wish list
   * Need to determine the reasons why some sites haven't done some of the validations
   * Add another section for sites that are preparing to become a top tier ITB site 
   * Want to try to have all ITB sites support all VO groups, might not be possible but should be ideal

---++ Pressing issues
  
   * RSV: more sites need to validate
      * probes can be run by hand independently of rsv infrastructure / server
   * Interoperability: need to test broad broadly now that schema in GOC BDII server has been updated.
      * Burt will update documenation
      * Rob will update site list on vors page list (servers will not go into production bdii, will go into the pps list)
      * Burt can alter attributes in  EGEE BDII to change how sites will appear list 
   * gLexec
      * need to add column for validation test  (will be left off until issues resolved)
      * Steve has found problems with glexec package but has a workaround posted to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WorkerNodeClient][WorkerNodeClient]]
      * ticket will be opened against vdt support to fix errors and problems that Steve has found
   * potential problem with vo package and ligo dn
   * Continuing problems with ws-gram (4 sites have the same problem -- seem to be client related), symptoms
      * client can't find java installation
      * several other layers
      * all problems with condor-g, command line tools (globusrun-ws) work
      * ongoing discussions with Jaime Frey and Charles Bacon to troubleshoot this 
   * sites need to try validating client
      * Steve will update documentation with workarounds for some issues that he's encountered
   * Storage:
      * UCSD hopes to be able to offer SRM 1.1/dCache storage element
      * Xin has run into problems with gsiftp and private pools (will be on agenda for thursday) when source is a gridftp server and destination is a srm server
      * Neha has run into similar problem even though the pool is not in a private network
      * Will be followed up on Thursday
