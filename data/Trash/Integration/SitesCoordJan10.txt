---++ Reports from OSG Users (Chris Green)
   * Wanted to get feedback from anyone not at the sites meeting?
   * Working w/ Rob Q to make a list of sites which do not support for OSG VO, and sites not reporting to !ReSS. There are common failure modes, eg. sites not opening up port 8443. 
   * Many sites do not have up to date VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo packages, and sites w/ GUMS need to get the latest template.  *We will send a description of the problem and fix to osg-sites.*
   * Need to revisit ticket 4285 - for general support for VOs among sites.


---++ DOEGrid CA cert expiration
   * Need to update CA certificate packages.  Not a problem if you've updated within the last 3 months, and no problems for sites with OSG 0.8.
   * *Rob Q will send an advisory to osg-sites.*


---++ Updating RSV (Arvind)
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallAndConfigureRSV - updated
   * Big proportion of OSG sites have not installed 0.8.0 (and consequently RSV) - please consider upgrading to 0.8.0, and configuring RSV.
   * Some sites that have already installed OSG 0.8.0 have not configured RSV -- please configure RSV.
   * And some sites who are running RSV have not updated their VDT installation to get bug fixes.. 
      * See detailed instructions at : http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.8.1/release-f.html 
   * *Arvind/Tom - sent an advisory to osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org.*
