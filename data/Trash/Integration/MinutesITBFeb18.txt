From -- Main.JohnWeigand - 18 Feb 2010: I apologize for not being able to attend today's meeting but would like to get some additional clarification on the 3 values for the _enable_ option on all services.
   1 Despite my grumblings in my initial response, I understand the need for certain services to have this new _ignore_ option.  However, I still contend we have to be very careful in which services get the privilege of using it.
   1 I don't really understand just what behavior we should or should not have for each value.  This is what I view the behavior to be and would like to be corrected as needed:
      * enable - this one seems obvious: validate the options and enable the service.
      * false - should 1st turn the service off (vdt-control --off). Then disable the service. 
      * ignore - should 1st turn the service off, then disable the service, then ignore it (I'll come back to the last the 'ignore' part after this bullet).  It could be, using rsv as the example, it could be I 1st started using RSV on my CE, then decided to run RSV centrally.  In which case, I should be able to set it to _ignore_ and have it turned off and then disabled it.

The part I don't get, is what the difference between _false_ and _ignore_ is.  In both cases, I should be turning the service off and then disabling it so it can't get turned on again.  Then is both cases it would appear I should ignore anything in that section.  What should _false_ do that _ignore_ shouldn't?  There is something I am not comprehending in this and need help.

From Alain, responding to John:

No, ignore should do nothing: it shouldn't turn it off, disable it, or configure it. 

False should turn off/disable the service. Right now, False may or may not do that, but I think it should. For now, I'm content if only RSV is implemented this way, but I think it should be that way in general.


---++ AOB
   * Documentation discussion next week to review triage list
