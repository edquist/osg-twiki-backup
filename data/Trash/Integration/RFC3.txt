---++ Introduction
In response to some concerns, that Burt Holtzman and the information group have with the current default configuration, I'd like to propose a change in the default settings in the config.ini for OSG 1.2.6.

---++  Motivation
The proposal is to change the default settings for the =Gratia= and =CEMon= sections from disabled to enabled.  This change is motivated by the desire to have !CEMon and Gratia enabled by default in order to match the behavior of configure-osg as found in OSG 1.2.3 and earlier.

---++  Scope
The =enabled= setting in the =CEMon= and =Gratia= sections of the default =config.ini= will be changed from =%(disable)s= to =%(enable)s=.  Code in configure-osg should not need to be changed.

---++  Effects
This will result in !CEMon and Gratia to be enabled by default on CEs.  Leaving the other settings as shipped will result in the !CEMon and Gratia being configured correctly for itb and production resources in my testing but this needs to be confirmed in wider VTB/ITB testing. 

---++  Timeline
This change would come out with osg 1.2.6.

---++  Current Status
In discussion (posted to osg-int list for comments)
