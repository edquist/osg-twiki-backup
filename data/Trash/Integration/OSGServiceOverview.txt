---++GT4 Services
Various services from GT4 available at GlobusOSG.


---++Pacman
The PacmanInfo is used for installing the core infrastructure and many of the other OSG services.
---++Virtual Data Toolkit
The VirtualDataToolkit (VDT) is the basic middleware platform for the OSG Integration Testbed. 
The bundle includes Globus, Condor, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and other services.  Included in VDT 1.3.3 and later is the Globus 4 version of GridFTP.

---++VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Administrative Services
The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrative services are being organized by the Privilege project.  The
PrivilegeOSG web provides a summary of OSG specific information for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo management.

---++Operations Cataloging and Validation Services

OSG cataloging services provide basic information regrading site parameters and status of services. These services use the OSG Registration Database along with information pulled from monitoring services and site verification to provide user with baseline information needed to preform tasks on the OSG.
---+++ GOC registration database

---+++ ACDC Operations Dashboard

   * [[http://osg.ccr.buffalo.edu/acdc_grid_tutorial/acdc_grid_tutorial.php?function=view&id=54][ACDC Tutorial]]

---+++ GOC Subscription Service

Through a joint effort of Indiana and Buffalo and capitalizing on the Monitoring and Information Services core infrastructure a robust subscription service is in the final stages of development. The subscription registration page will provide subscription information and customizable interface clients for distribution within the OSG user community. The initial subscriptions include:

   * GIP/MDS/BDII GLUE Schema resource based information (CE and SE)
   * ACDC Operations Dashboard Compute Element operational status
   * ACDC Operations Dashboard Storage Element operational status
   * Resource maintenance schedules (CE and SE)
   * Registered resource information (CE and SE)
   * Resource level VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo support information

This push based model will be available for comment and trial through the OSG Integration Testbed.

---+++ Virtual Organization Resource Selector (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS)

   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRSServiceReadinessPlan

---++Monitoring and Information Services
---+++Core MIS
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (CoreMIS) has been successfully deployed during the Integration testbed meeting and is now released as MIS-CI version 0.2.5. The current version can be obtained with: 

<verbatim> 
pacman &#65533;get iVDGL:MIS-CI
</verbatim>

---+++Grid Cat
GridCat provides a catalog of site attribute information and results of validation tests.

---+++Monalisa
MonALISA provides a repository of time-sampled information from various sources.

---+++BDII and GLUE
Discussions regarding OSG-specific uses of BDII and issues of GLUE schema are availble at GlueOSG.

---+++Discovery Service 
The discovery service provides a registry for publishing and querying grid services. It has similar functionality to a UDDI registry but provides a more lightweight API, xmlrpc accessibility and a much more dynamic and distributed architecture. Service publications can be performed at any instance of the discovery service and the publication will be automatically broadcast to all other instances of the discovery service. This allows clients to locate services from any discovery service instance, regardless of where the initial service publication took place. 

   * Service Readiness Plan for the JClarens-based discovery service is available here: [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][ClarensDiscoveryService]].
   * DiscoveryServiceInstallation instructions specific to the OSG are in place.

---++Accounting
Accounting will be provided by MonALISA and ACDC.

---++Resource Selection Service
The Resource Selection infrastructure is based on the CEMon information publishing infrastructure and is built around the Condor Match Making Service. Information on  the service are available at the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/][ReSS project]] home page.

The Service Readiness Plan document for the Resource Selection Service is available at [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/ServiceReadiness][http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/ServiceReadiness]]
---++Storage Services
---+++Disk Resource Manager
The SRM DiskResourceManager product available in the VDT is used to provide a 
storage management interface to disk-based storage resources presented to the OSG.
