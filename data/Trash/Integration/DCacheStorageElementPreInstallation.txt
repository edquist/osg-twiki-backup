See [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/SrmDCache][SRM/dCache]] for system and software requirements for running dCache.

Before installation, check that `hostname` and `hostname -d` give the correct values on your system. If `hostname -d` returns an empty string, it will suffice either to enter your *domain* in the SERVER_ID field of the file /opt/d-cache/etc/node_config during the dCache installation, or to have a "search" line in /etc/resolv.conf with your domain as the value.

You will need a host certificate from DOEGrid to run SRM, the preferred client for file transfers. If you do not have a host certificate, follow the instructions for installing a Compute Element in the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/OsgCEInstallGuide][OSG CE Install Guide]], up through "Request and Install Host Certificate". If you only want to use the node as a Storage Element, when the installation asks about enabling Globus jobmanager for Condor or Condor batch system, reply with "n". Choose option 2 when running vdt/setup/setup-cert-request, and accept the default DN. If you are not planning to use the node as a Compute Element, it is not necesary to complete the CE installation beyond the "Request and Install Host Certificate" section.

When you are notified by email and directed to a web page to receive your certificate, be sure not to copy into /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem the certificate labeled "Base 64 encoded certificate with CA certificate chain in pkcs7 format". Otherwise, you will get the error:

<verbatim>
SRMClientV1 : org.globus.common.ChainedIOException: Authentication failed [Caused by: Failure unspecified at GSS-API level [Caused by: Bad certificate (Invalid certificate chain at 'DC=org,DC=doegrids,OU=Services,CN=fledgling09.fnal.gov' certificate. Subject and issuer names do not match)]]
</verbatim>

Instead, copy the certificate labeled "Base 64 encoded certificate".
