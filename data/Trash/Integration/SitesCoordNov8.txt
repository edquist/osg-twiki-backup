---++ Report from Facility deputy (Todd Tannenbaum)
   * Report about metrics during December meeting.

---++ Report from OSG users (Chris Green)
   * Summary of OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo tests, http://user-support.opensciencegrid.org/site_tests/osg/latest/
      * Making it simple to understand if a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is supported at a site, or not.
      * Put a ticket for sites that claim, but do not, support the OSG.
      * Question is whether VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS information is correct - 45 dropped to 39 sites claimed to support OSG, 20 actually do support dropped to 19.
      * Is the vo package being updated at sites?
      * Question of advertized intent/claim.
      * We've identified a group to clarify this: *Tim* will setup a meeting to resolve this: others to attend: Chris, Alain, !RobQ, !RobG.
   * srmcp issue - operating behind firewalls.
      * A command-line option to force the srmcp into passive mode.  Only configurable by user's config, or on the command line - no way to wrap the exec, etc.,  to set on a site basis.
      * No commitment to make the change by the srmcp developers.

---++ OSG 0.8 released, reports from early adopters, operations (Rob Quick)
   * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
   * Announced last Thursday.  Seven sites have installed OSG 0.8.0 release. 
   * Two minor issues - dccp on wn-client, resolved in VDT 1.8.1c;  Issue about Globus-Condor package issue w/ Managed Fork. 
   * Getting syslog-ng's from a couple of sites.  Useful for debugging.  Encouraging sites to forward syslog.
   * There a couple of sites still running OSG 0.4 UNM, and Northern Iowa - may be dropped.
   
---++ Updating installations (Alain Roy)
The question is about the use of a fresh install for new OSG versions, as opposed to a "pacman -update". Right now, we recommend that people do a fresh "side-by-side" installation that copies over configuration instead of trying to get Pacman updates to work. I think there are good advantages to this method (less downtime, preservation of the old installation), but I'm not sure everyone agrees. I would like a short discussion to get feedback about it. 
   * Wayne: prefers separate installations.  Don't trust pacman, or pacman updates.  Also useful to remember what's going on.  Would be nice in the future (eg. 1.0 to 1.2).
   * Rob: side-by-side since no intuitive feel for reliability of pacman -update.
   * Suchandra - side-by-side: backup to reference
   * Kevin - side-by-side: likes having a symlink pointing to the latst version.
   * Jay: upgrading would be preferred, if it were reliable.

---++ WS Gram and Managed Fork (discussion)
From Terrence, UCSD:%BR%
<em>
I am not sure if you saw any of the emails flying around, but on Friday Charles Bacon and I worked out the details to enabling WSGram and ManagedFork to work nicely with each other. However to do so smoothly currently there would need to be a small change in how ManagedFork replaces old style Fork on the CE. Right now when you enable Managed Fork it becomes the default Fork queue. So when using GT2 or PreWS Globus client tools to talk to the fork queue you use Managed Fork, not the older fork. However this is done by changing a file that points to the ManagedFork, rather than replacing the Fork.pm file with the Managed Fork equivalent.

I assume this was done this way for some transitional reason.

The change to allow WS Gram to support ManagedFork however requires that not only all of the pointers within the CE for WS Gram point to the ManagedFork code, the name of the ManagedFork.pm has to be changed to Fork.pm, requiring the old Fork to be either over written or moved to a non-active location in the CE install.

Now my position as a site admin is that if I enable ManagedFork I am doing so with the assumption that I am disabling old Fork altogether and that all users, including myself, will be using ManagedFork. Any access to the old fork through any side mechanism would be considered a violation of site policy. As a result I do not have any problem with the old Fork code being moved and the ManagedFork code put in its place. The one concern I would have though is that if old Fork got a VDT update that it would be prevented if ManagedFork was installed. The features I would like for example:
   * Toggle from Fork to Managed Fork that does all the tricks to allow GT2 and GT4 to support ManagedFork
   *  Have the Toggle reversible (move, don't delete)
   * Have some sort of stop to prevent a fork update from clobbering the changed file

   * Alain: managed fork is not quite smooth enough, and the suggestions are on target.
   * Should managed fork become a default?
   * From the survey, 50% site admins said they would install Managed Fork.  Why aren't the others?   Lack of familiarity?
   * Timeframe - Alain needs to consider whether its simple to do w/ an upgrade.

---++ Gratia suite feedback (Chris Green)
   * Feedback on Gratia, and any comments, questions or problem reports that may come from site admins and managers
   * New change to the web interface; new reporting engine - and there have been a few problems.
   * Feedback
      * slowness of the reporting engine
      * will need to change the db engine
      * See osg accounting twiki page for applicable mailing lists, Accounting.WebHome (problems to gratia-operations)
      * canned reports - no involving the DB lookup - coming in a new release.

---++ AOB
   * Respone to CR drill?
