---++ Updating installations (Alain Roy)
The question is about the use of a fresh install for new OSG versions, as opposed to a "pacman -update". Right now, we recommend that people do a fresh "side-by-side" installation that copies over configuration instead of trying to get Pacman updates to work. I think there are good advantages to this method (less downtime, preservation of the old installation), but I'm not sure everyone agrees. I would like a short discussion to get feedback about it. 

---++ Gratia suite feedback (Chris Green)
   * Feedback on Gratia, and any comments, questions or problem reports that may come from site admins and managers
