---++ Updating installations (Alain Roy)
The question is about the use of a fresh install for new OSG versions, as opposed to a "pacman -update". Right now, we recommend that people do a fresh "side-by-side" installation that copies over configuration instead of trying to get Pacman updates to work. I think there are good advantages to this method (less downtime, preservation of the old installation), but I'm not sure everyone agrees. I would like a short discussion to get feedback about it. 

---++ WS Gram and Managed Fork (discussion)
From Terrence, UCSD:%BR%
<em>
I am not sure if you saw any of the emails flying around, but on Friday Charles Bacon and I worked out the details to enabling WSGram and ManagedFork to work nicely with each other. However to do so smoothly currently there would need to be a small change in how ManagedFork replaces old style Fork on the CE. Right now when you enable Managed Fork it becomes the default Fork queue. So when using GT2 or PreWS Globus client tools to talk to the fork queue you use Managed Fork, not the older fork. However this is done by changing a file that points to the ManagedFork, rather than replacing the Fork.pm file with the Managed Fork equivalent.

I assume this was done this way for some transitional reason.

The change to allow WS Gram to support ManagedFork however requires that not only all of the pointers within the CE for WS Gram point to the ManagedFork code, the name of the ManagedFork.pm has to be changed to Fork.pm, requiring the old Fork to be either over written or moved to a non-active location in the CE install.

Now my position as a site admin is that if I enable ManagedFork I am doing so with the assumption that I am disabling old Fork altogether and that all users, including myself, will be using ManagedFork. Any access to the old fork through any side mechanism would be considered a violation of site policy. As a result I do not have any problem with the old Fork code being moved and the ManagedFork code put in its place. The one concern I would have though is that if old Fork got a VDT update that it would be prevented if ManagedFork was installed. The features I would like for example:
   * Toggle from Fork to Managed Fork that does all the tricks to allow GT2 and GT4 to support ManagedFork
   *  Have the Toggle reversible (move, don't delete)
   * Have some sort of stop to prevent a fork update from clobbering the changed file
