---++Version Practice in the "OSG CE 0.5.n Installation Instructions"
In the sub-sections that follow, some use-cases for the twiki INCLUDE directive are identified along with the rationale for using them.  As like everything else, there are pluses and minuses and we must be very careful not to get carried away as they can fragment the documation to the point where their use defeats the original purpose of easily maintained and consistent documentation.
This is useful in determining all areas of the OSG documentation being affected by any changes you may be making.
