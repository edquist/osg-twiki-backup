---+++ Testing and Validation
The only change in this release is an update to the Gratia probes, Xrootd, and the addition of Bestman 2.  There are two important things to test:
   * Gratia probes have been updated so accounting information for your site should be checked
   * Xrootd should be checked as well if you have a Bestman xrootd installation and extra time. Xrootd has already been carefully reviewed by the storage team and ATLAS, so minimal ITB testing is needed.

Validate that information is being published correctly to Gratia.

---++++ Components Changed
The only change in the software is an update to a new version of the Gratia probes, Xrootd and a  Bestman 2 package has been added as well.  

The Bestman 2 package is a major update of Bestman.  Although it will probably eventually replace Bestman, it does not need to be tested right now.  *The Bestman package still downloads the current Bestman installation and has not changed in this release.* 

---++++ Testing
Admins should try the steps outlined at [[Integration.TestingGuidelines1212][the testing guidelines page]].   In addition, Gratia accounting information should be verified. 

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
