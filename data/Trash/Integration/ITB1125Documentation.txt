---+++ Testing and Validation
The only change in this release is an update to the Gratia, Xrootd, and the addition of Bestman 2.  There are two important things to test:
   * Gratia probes have been updated so accounting information for your site should be checked
   * Xrootd should be checked as well if you have a bestman xrootd installation.

Validate that information is being published correctly to Gratia.

---++++ Components Changed
The only change in the software is an update to a new version of Gratia, Xrootd and a  Bestman 2 package has been added as well.  

The Bestman 2 package is a major update of bestman.  Although it will probably eventually replace bestman, it does not need to be tested right now unless you have spare time.  *The Bestman package still downloads the current bestman installation and has not changed in this release.* 

---++++ Testing
Admins should try the steps outined at [[Integration.TestingGuidelines1212][the testing guidelines page]].   In addition, gratia accounting information should be verified. 

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
