---++ Featured tutorial: Swift: simple parallel scripting for campus grids (Michael Wilde)
Michael will demonstrate how to effectively use Swift in a Campus Grid. 
Swift is a high-level parallel scripting language that makes it easy to run many instances of ordinary programs concurrently. Swift scripts
are short, simple, and location-independent: the same script runs on multicore computers, clusters, grids, clouds, and supercomputers. The
Swift programming model is implicitly parallel. Its statements and functions execute concurrently as soon as their inputs are available,
reducing the complexity of parallel scripting for scientists, engineers, and data analysts.

Michael Wilde is a computer scientist at Argonne National Laboratory and the Argonne/UChicago Computation Institute.

---++ BOSCO 1.2 testing
[[CampusGrids.BoscoQuickStart][BOSCO]] 1.2 and [[CampusGrids.BoscoR][BOSCO-R]] are available . Any feedback is more than welcome. Feel free to add comments to this page or email us at  bosco-discuss@opensciencegrid.org .


---+++ BOSCO and BOSCO testing background
If you are not familiar with BOSCO, there is a short introduction, describing also the tests, attached to the [[MinutesCampusItb130110][1/10 minutes]]:
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]]
Bosco documentation is available also in:
   * http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoSCO
The easiest way to install BOSCO is using the [[CampusGrids.BoscoQuickStart][quickstart guide]]

BOSCO testing focuses on three main use cases:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing and how to contribute to it.
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Integration/MinutesCampusItb130110/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives also an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.
