All

I'd like to get your opinion on this being included in the base template for the ITB documentation.

I have created a topic called 'WhuReferences' so as to be able to more easily see where a topic is being used and how it is being used.  This, to me, is especially useful when INCLUDE's are used.

The value is both to any editors and user-only types as I see it.

You can view this at:
  http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/WhuReferences

I have used it on these pages so you can see the affect:

 - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/Integration.ITB_0_5.OsgCEAuthorization

 - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/Integration.ITB_0_5.OsgConventions
    As the xref shows this is included on several pages right now,
    but will not show up in those docs because they are outside the
    scope of the STARTINCLUDE AND STOPINCLUDE directives.
    The CE install guide below illustrates this.

 - http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/CEInstallGuide050
    On the CE install guide page, there is an include for
    Integration.ITB_0_5.OsgConventions and you can see that this does not
    get "included" on the install guide page.
    But at the bottom of the page, you can see the xrefs for the
    install guide itself.

I think it is useful... your opinions? ... and if there is a better way of doing it, i'm plenty open to it.

... and Forrest, if you see anything wrong, don't hesitate to holler... including caveats to this.

Thanks in advance
John Weigand

   * Need more information on how to contribute.  Need to articulate documentation rules, for example, where to make changes for deltas between releases.
   * Ingredients of a "best practices" guide:
      * Description of release versioning scheme
      * How to use INCLUDE directives 
      * How to use "Whu" references.
      * A beginning for this has been setup in the current documentation table.
   * Forrest will check out use of an automated tools for creating new documentation sets.
      * Here are his suggestions: Documentation.ReleasesOnTheIntegrationWeb
