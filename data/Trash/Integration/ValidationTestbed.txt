---++ Introduction
The Validation Testbed (VTB) is an small-scale, self-contained, service-level infrastructure for pre-Integration validation of the OSG software stack, as described in the OSG IntegrationProject plan.

---++ Software
   * The VTB software cache is located on a webserver located here: http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/.
   * Use pacman -get http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/vtb:ce to install the latest ce version from the cache
   * A site validation table can be found at http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/result-page.html
   * A subversion repository for the pacman files can be found at http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/cache
   * See VTBSubversionTips to get a quick tutorial on using subversion and how it works

   * UChicago
   * LIGO-Caltech
   * LBNL
   * Fermilab
   * GOC

---++ Validation Test: Basic CE functionality
   * LIGO-Caltech: site_verify passes all tests 01/11

---++ Validation Test: CEMon, Res Sel, BDII
   * LIGO-Caltech: 01/12  CEMon condor_status -pool osg-ress-4.fnal.gov 
      CEDAR:6001: Failed to connect to <131.225.110.150:9618>
      was able to telnet to osg-ress-4.fnal.gov 9618 
      Is this the proper port ? Is osg-ress-4 service ok?

---++ Validation Test: Gratia
   * LIGO-Caltech:  01/12  Installed Gratia-Condor-161
      No evidence that GratiaProbe with: SOAPHost="gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8881"
      registered on gratia ITB site. Reported to osg-accounting.
   * No results from UCTier3 have been reported to Gratia yet. 
---++ Validation Test: WS Gram

   *  http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/execution/wsgram/WS_GRAM_Quality_Profile.html#s-wsgram-Quality_Profile-test  

   * LBNL/NERSC: Installation of Globus-SGE-Setup failed because it includes Globus-WS-SGE-Setup - this latter package is not yet available.  Solution is to remove the Globus-WS-SGE-Setup for this release.
