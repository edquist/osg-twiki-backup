   * Talking to developers to correct this

---++ Interoperability (Burt)

   * No timeframe for ws-gram support
   * Will be engaged in activity so that when egee supports ws-gram this will work in osg
   * Issue will be revisted when OSG is ready to support osg
   * Burt is eyeing the possibility of leveraging fermigrid's efforts to get interoperability with teragrid
   * Going forward:
      * Will want full chain of testing during ITB testing
      * Limited testing of SE although there is limited guidance from EGEE on this
      * Staying current with EGEE 
      * Looking at GT2 vs. GT4 advertising
