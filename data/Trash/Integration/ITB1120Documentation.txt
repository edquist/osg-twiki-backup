%TOC%

---+++ Introduction
This page has the update and testing instructions for the osg 1.2.9 (osg-itb 1.1.20) update.


---+++ Installation 
Admins will need to install from the ITB cache.   If you have a previous installation, you can upgrade as well.

---+++ Updating from previous ITB release 
%NOTE% This only applies to upgrades from ITB 1.1.10 or more recent.

%NOTE% *There are changes to the way that !CEMon, Gratia, and resource names are configured for !CEs in this release, please see the [[#PostInstallConfiguration][post-installation configuration section]] before restarting your CE*

---++++ Preliminaries
Go to the directory where you installed your software (root directory of the Pacman installation, =VDT_LOCATION=) and source the setup script so that the following steps will work correctly.
<pre class="screen">
cd VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
</pre>

Make sure that your batch system binaries are in your PATH, especially if you are running SGE.

---++++ Stop VDT Services
Some packages (e.g. =client= or =wn-client=) may not be running any services, however, doing this step will not cause problems.  

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---++++ Backup your software
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP_LOCATION
</pre>

---++++ RSV update (*Only sites upgrading from ITB 1.1.16*)
If and only if you are upgrading from ITB 1.1.16, you must run the following step:

<pre class="screen">
vdt-uninstall OSG-RSV > $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/update-1.1.16.output
</pre>

Sites updating from ITB 1.1.15 or earlier, or sites updating from ITB 1.1.17 or later should *NOT* run this step.


---++++ Update the VDT updater script itself

Get the latest version of the vdt-updater script:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre>

Note: If you do not yet have the updater script (look for $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/update/vdt-updater), then fetch it with this command:
<pre class="screen">pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:VDT-Updater</pre>


---++++ Backup

Backup again since the vdt-updater script will request the location of your backup and verify that the backup is identical to the current contents of the install directory before updating your installation.
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP_LOCATION
</pre> 

---++++ Get VDT Updates
This will update VDT packages specifically.
<pre class="screen">
vdt/update/vdt-updater
</pre>

After updating, re-source the setup.sh file to load any changes in the environment:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
</pre>

---++++ Get OSG Updates
The =osg-version= and =osg-config= packages must be updated on all OSG installations:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update osg-version
cp $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini /tmp/config.ini-backup
pacman -update osg-config
cp /tmp/config.ini-backup $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini
</pre>


#PostInstallConfiguration
---++++  Post Install Configuration 
After you complete the updates of your packages, you will need to run the =vdt-post-install= script in order to complete any post-installation setups needed after your packages have been updated:

<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>


---+++++ Reconfiguration
On a CE, you will also need to reconfigure your system
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>


---++++ Restart VDT Services
This step can be omitted if you are not running any services.  If you are not certain, you can run it since services are disabled by default so the only services that will be started are ones that you have explicitly enabled.
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>



---+++ Testing and Validation

---++++ Components Changed
Several components have changed in this release including prima, configure-osg, bestman, xrootd, cemon, gratia, and other components.  See [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p16.html][the vdt release notes]] for details.

---++++ Testing
Admins should try the steps outined at [[Integration.TestingGuidelines129][the testing guidelines page]].  

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
