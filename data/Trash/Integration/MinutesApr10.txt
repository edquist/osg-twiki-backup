   * Previous meetings, MinutesWSGramApril02, MinutesAttributesApr3, MinutesApr5

---++ WS Gram testing update
   * See new results in WSGramValidation060.  Have source of scaling problems been understood?  Reproduced on another site?
   * From last meeting, try out tests at t2dev site at UC.  Scaling behavior was different from the LIGO site.
   * Service dies after queue length reaches 120 jobs.
   * Also, re-ran on LIGO site after expansion of maxheapsize, but this didn't seem to make a difference.
   * But, *why does the service fail* ?  (the container needs to be restarted)  Both Martin and Suchandra will check these results.
   * Martin suggests that Jeff submit to his host at Nebraska, will be 3500 jobs.  
   * Martin will try to submit to t2dev from his service.
   * There are Condor-G parameters to adjust: max-submitted, max-pending that have to be set.
   * Note - Alan also has WS resources available for testing.

---+++ Rav's testing
   * Testing using a prime number calculator as a test.  Finding a number of jobs go into an unsubmitted state - the jobs submit themselves as an XML file, using the web services interface.  Using =globusrun-ws= as the client.  Submitting from headnode of the cluster to itself.  These are run in the background, and so you have many running at once.
   * Alan will provide a web link, with the script.

---+++ David's testing
   * Running a ws-enabled nanohype application against sites in the ITB (the LIGO validation test).
   * Condor-G from Pegasus is the submission method.
   * Alan offers testwulf as a resource for this cluster.
 
---++ OSG Attributes
   * See current status in AttributesSubcommittee, which will serve as a final report.
   * What remaining pieces are needed for this report to be complete?
   * Have been looking into the SE attributes, and sub-cluster attributes (for Glue 1.3), and establishing the convention for 1.2 sites.
   * For the final report - 
      * Final critical attributes are set.
      * Focus on SRM/dCache as the basis for establishing the convention.
   * Anand notes that SE information is published through a CE.
   * Anand will review the AttributesSubcommittee document carefully for consideration by the end of the week.
