---++ Background
The SiteVerify script which is used by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS has been very useful but could be improved in a number of ways.  In some cases we may need new types of validation tools in order to perform site functional testing/service availability monitoring, etc.

---++ Job manager testing
   * Submission of test jobs to the site, such as GridEx.

---++ Information service testing
   * Are GIP's being executed correctly
   * Compare information from BDII and Ress.
   * Are OSG attributes correctly published?
   * Work on this from GROW -
