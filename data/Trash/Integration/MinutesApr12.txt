---++ Syslog-ng
   * See SysLog and http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/Logging/SyslogInstall as an example.  Suchandra will be providing recommendations for the VTB, and will setup a central VTB logging service for monitoring and debugging.
   * Issues identify:
      * Running tail | logger reliably
      * Converting files to unified format
      * Configuration of central host (disk space?)
      * Information already going to syslog
      * Need to rotate, or otherwise handle log files at collection point. (Brian mentioned a database once, I think.)
      * Need to be crystal clear about how we handle syslog-ng next to syslog, and how people can switch to just syslog-ng if they prefer.
