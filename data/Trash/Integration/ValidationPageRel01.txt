---++VO Validation
The following table summarizes use of proxy certificates on Grid3 and the OSG ITB.

---++Site Verify
The site_verify.pl was developed by Craig Prescott.  The site_verify.pl script can be downloaded from 

<tt>
$ wget http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify.pl .
</tt>

It requires a valid grid proxy and the globus client software in the PATH. You can run it as regular user as follows:

<tt>
$ cd /opt/osgdev/
$ . setup.sh
$ cd -
$ grid-proxy-init
$ perl site_verify.pl --host=$GKHOST
</tt>

with $GKHOST being any of the gatekeepers advertised in GridCat, http://www.ivdgl.org/osg-int/gridcat/index.php?whichmap=us.

It first does some basic connectivity tests and checks for a globus gatekeeper and gridftp server, and then tests all basic globus services like globus-job-run, gridftp, all the advertised jobmanagers, the host certificate and the grid-mapfile, the existence of site env vars and the directories they point to, the advertised installed software, as well as checks for MDS, Ganglia, and MonALISA. 
Common problems are authentication failures because of missing DN entries in the grid-mapfile, globus and gridftp failures because of firewall issues and/or tcp wrapper denials, unknown paths to (Condor and "remote scheduler") binaries, GRIS not running, or permission/existence problems on $DATA, $TMP, and/or $APP.  In addition, a jobmanager-condor is usually created whether or not condor is used as a remote scheduler or not; for sites which do not use condor, this produces a 'condor : NOT WORKING' result when testing the status of the remote schedulers.  For the purposes of the ITB workshop, any failure of site_verify.pl to probe the remote batch system were deemed tolerable, as site_verify.pl's methods for doing this aren't yet completely robust.
