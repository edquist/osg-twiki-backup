   * ITB 0.5.0 issues since Aug 10:
      * Work continues on a modification to the configure-osg script to incorporate start/stop config-gip scripts.
      * Further work is needed on configuring CE-Mon. Preliminary documentation for manual configuration completed
      * A script automating much of the CE-Mon configuration is being assembled by J. Weigand.
   * Operations issues
      * Removal of the MIS-CI package: impact on packages, representation in GLUE schema
         * GridCat still provides essential services and catalog capabilities. 
         * Request monitoring-wg  provide a capabilities and maturities matrix for understanding the trade-offs between monitoring frameworks.
      * SRM_CONFIG: osg-client ISSUE=2291 PROJ=71, need for setting in a script for users:  A. Sill experienced problems with 32 bit 
        install of the srmcp client. Better documentation/characterization of the problem needed to guide practice. Recurring trouble tickets

      * L. Grunhoefer discussed that an Ops VO has been created for site functional tests. 
      * C. Green provided a detailed roadmap on the upcoming Gratia accounting package, Condor and PBS probes, and deliverable for
