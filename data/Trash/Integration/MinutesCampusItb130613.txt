---++ Featured tutorial: Bosco + !SkeletonKey for High Throughput R Applications (Marco Mambelli)
The tutorial will show how working on your host you can submit jobs using an application installed on OSG OASIS to a remote cluster you have access
to. Specifically Marco will be using BOSCO and !SkeletonKey to run on a remote cluster R jobs, where R is an application available on OSG OASIS.

This is a re-run of the 18/4 iForum. The differences are that:
   * on 4/18 there were some problems that have been worked out
   * the software is installed on CVMFS using an initial version PALMS, a new tool that I'm working on and that I'd like some feedback about

The tutorial's material is available on the OSG Twiki: CampusGrids.CICiForum130418
