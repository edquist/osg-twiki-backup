---+++ Introduction
This page has the update and testing instructions for the osg 1.2.10 (osg-itb 1.1.22) update.


---+++ Installation 
Admins will need to install from the new ITB cache.   If you have a previous installation, you will need to reinstall the software due to a change in the cache location.  The new ITB cache location is =http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2/=.  When you install the ITB software, you will need to use this url when specifying the cache, e.g. 
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:ce
</pre>

Also note that when running =vdt-ca-manage=, you should specify =ITB= as the url, e.g. 
<pre class="screen">
vdt-ca-manage setupca --url itb --location &lt;local|root|PATH&gt;
</pre> 




---+++ Testing and Validation

---++++ Components Changed
Several components have changed in this release including bestman, xrootd, apache, and other components.  See [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p17.html][the vdt release notes]] for details.

---++++ Testing
