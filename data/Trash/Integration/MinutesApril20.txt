---++Other Items

   * Include VDT Client or Globus client?
   * Service validations -- are these hapening?  Will send out list.
   * Verify VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS API/Apache conflict fixed in VDT 1.3.5 - John will fix
   * Glaring problems.  Site admin documentation is confusing. Under "Do it", there are no clear instructions for setting up a site for PRIMA.  Leigh worked on this section.   Need GUMS service running, eg. Configure GUMS host.  John W will review the SiteAdmins and GumsAdmins topics.
   * iVDGL gridcat at BNL.  Bockjoo will buzz Xin.
   * SiteVerify will be updated by Craig today.
   * Marco reviewed ML features to check for capabilities.  New ML client needs to be run against the ITB ML database. Is it available now? 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMSandMYPROXY twiki topic added by Marcus (testing needed to determine if VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS credential survive a My proxy transit)
      * My proxy client has been added to the Core install. Shouldn't this be a separate, optional package? Client and server come together, better if these are split. 
      * Dane points out that the My proxy server is a sensitive service, in the same class as voms.  But Leigh points out its not started, and its small, and the client tool is there.  Should we take it out.
      * Decision: leave it in, as a fellow traveller with the VDT, undocumented.
      * My proxy will not be able to use voms attributes in VDT 1.3.5.
   * Question came up with international sites currently in Grid3; understanding is they come through the  VOs, and thats where the coordination occurs.  Being handling in deployment.
