<pre>
a) configure-grid3.sh script
- Marco/Craig (?) offered to rewrite this to improve clarity and remove "in your face" Grid3-ism. Will/is this being done ?
- Question on whether/how to rewrite the "Configuring the Grid3 Information Provider" section since it seems to be more than an MDS configuration (particularly the use of grid3-info.conf which is wider than at least I understood).

b) site_verify.pl
- Craig had what I consider a good idea on how to modify the MonALISA testing section. Will/should this be done ?

---+++Leigh's reply
<pre>
  I saw the emails and since I am the original author 
  am trying to update the script for the 2.4 version
  of the grid3-ip installation.

  One issue is that the configure_monalisa.sh script requires some of
	the same informaiton and it would be nice to have a shared configure
	file that is sourced between the scripts.

	I am awaiting a newer version of site_verify.pl but am not sure
	of the feature set.

Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend the meeting. My sincere apologies. 
We are doing lots of interviews these days, and I have three back-to-back 
interviews on Thursday afternoon. The upside is that we will hopefully get 
a new VDT person out of this process.

I reported on the GIP and on Monalisa in separate emails.

About the VOMS interoperability update: Right now, VDT 1.3.6 contains VOMS 
1.4.1 "openssltest_2", which is identical to VOMS 1.4.1 (which is in VDT 
1.3.5) except that it has the necessary bug fix. So we are all set.

There is a chance we'll update to VOMS 1.5.0 if it's released Thursday. 
This is the version that will be adopted by LCG and EGEE. It *should* be 
perfectly compatible with VOMS 1.4.1, but it would be nice to upgrade to be 
certain. However, I don't know if VOMS 1.5.0 will be released in time or not.

After our nightly tests run tonight, I expect we'll talk to a few people 
about testing the VDT. We're more or less done, except for any needed bug 
fixes.

If people want to see the documentation on VDT 1.3.6 as it exists (it's in 
the process of being updated, but it's not bad), it's available at: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.6/index.html

People may be particularly interested in the "what's new" list: http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.6/release.html

Any other questions? Send email or join the VDT office hour at 11:00am 
Central Time on Thursday. http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/office-hours/index.html

---++Grid Ex readiness and integration
In order to deploy Gid Ex on the ITB we needed a readiness plan and some additional VO related work.
	* See the GridEx topic for readiness plan and background information, including detailed instructions for site admins to adjust queue priority settings for GridEx.
	* Needed to know which sites to debug, which not to bother with.  Solved with new state flag in GridCat.
	* Need to establish a GridEx VO for the ITB, in order to distinguish GridEx backfill jobs from jobs coming from other applications. 
		* Create GridEx group using the iGOC VOMS server.
		* Obtain a GridEx certificate, insert into VOMS.
		* Create instructions for site and/or GUMS admins.  This follows.
	* Site admins will have to do one of two things to support the GridEx:
		* GUMS-enabled sites:
		* Traditional site (edg makegridmap sites):
	* Create new vo-package for use with Traditional sites.


---++Site state information in GridCat 

Last week we asked Bockjoo to provide a site state flag, which is meant to provide a semaphore ("I'm alive, open for business", or "Don't bother") between the site admin and the ITB.

<pre>
Dear All,
We release GridCat 0.8.6. The purpose of this release is to provide a frozen version of gridcat instance for provisioning (OSG-0.1.6 and 
eventually OSG-0.2.0).

The only new feature is the grid site state bit
, active or inactive. So that GEx can know this site state. Because of this new feature, it is also possible for site admins to comment about 
the site status. Anything else is same as 0.8.5.

Gridcat page can be found from:
http://www.ivdgl.org/gridcat
GridCat 0.8.6 is tested for four days.
No life-threathening defect is found yet.
Demo gridcat page for this version can be found from : http://gdsuf.phys.ufl.edu:8080/gridcat

Thank you,
Bockjoo

---++Monalisa issues

	 - updates for logfile parsing	
	 - new repository
	 - continued problems with installation


	* From Iosif, http://pccil.cern.ch:8889/

<pre>

Hello

We have a new version of the MonALISA repository and
I would like to suggest to use it for the OSG .
A  test / demo  version using the OSG-ITB sites is now running at :

http://pccil.cern.ch:8889/

This repository  has a short history now ( it is a development system )

This new version has :

- dynamic maps with the possibility to zoom it to  any resolution
-  multiple filters in how sites are presented on the maps
-  more global views  for VO jobs and sites
-  an improved storage system
-  a new design of the web page

In this new version any new site, part in OSG-ITB will appear on the maps automatically and for this reason it is important that each site declares its coordinates correctly .

There are now OSG-ITB sites, outside the US:  in Brazil, Russia, Korea, 
Taiwan
Shall we start the repository by default with the US map or the World map ? We can change the defult  map very easily.

The Admin / Setup pages have the same user / password as on the grid3 
repository.

If you like this new version , I can replace the OSG-ITB repository with this version and  install it for the OSG  on the new serever at

Best Regards,
ioji
