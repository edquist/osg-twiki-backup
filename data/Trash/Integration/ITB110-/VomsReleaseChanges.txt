---++ VOMS changes for this release
%EDITTHIS%

---+++ CRL updates
The CRL update process that ran as a daemon (<i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i>) has been converted to a <i>root</i> cron process.  The time will be selected randomly at installation time so as to reduce contention for these updates.

<pre class="programlisting">
  6 1 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
</pre>

%IMPORTANT% You will need to manually remove the <i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i> before performing this installation.

---+++ <i>vdt-control</i> script for startup/shutdown of processes/crons
A new capability has been provided in this release for startup and shutdown of OSG daemons and crons.

---+++ VOMS can now use an  HTTP service certificate. 
We had been using a copy of the host certificate for the last few OSG/VDT releases, but this caused some security and administrative concerns.  So, if do not already have one, you can request the HTTP certificate for your VOMS host and replace the <i>cloned</i> HOST certificate. %BR%%BR%  Prior to OSG-0.5.0, this <i>cloned</i> HOST certificate was created in the <i>/etc/grid-security</i> as <i>vomscert.pem</i> and <i>vomskey.pem</i>.  You will want to remove them and use an HTTP service certificate as describe later in this manual.

---++ Resolved VOMS problems/issues for this release.
   1. The problem of running the =configure-voms= script after <i>root</i> password for <nop>MySql database is set has been resolved. (GOC ticket 66899 / [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=1478][VDT ticket 1478]]). You can (and should) now be setting the <i>root</i> password on the VOMS <nop>MySQL database.
   1. The problem with the the script to remove a VO from the VOMS instance. Running =configure-voms --remove= has been resolved. (GOC ticket 74637/ [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=1517][VDT ticket 1517]])
   1. Log rotation for the VOMS logs files is now being performed correctly (GOC ticket 74641/ [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=1516][VDT ticket 1516]])
