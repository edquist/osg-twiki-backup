*Purpose*:   The purpose of this document is to provide dCache based SE administrators the information on how to prepare, install and validate the SE. 

---++ Preparation
---+++ Introduction
dCache is a disk-caching system jointly developed by Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). Although it was initially developed to provide disk caching for tertiary storage, dCache makes an excellent grid Storage Element (SE) &ndash; even without tape backend &ndash; because it has a [[https://srm.fnal.gov/twiki/bin/view/SrmProject/WebHome][Storage Resource Manager]] interface and  supports multiple transfer protocols:  gridftp, xrootd, dcap, and http. dCache also provides a single name space across the entire pool of disk servers, making it look like a single file system to the users. It simplifies administration by providing mechanisms for internal clean-up and load balancing, which alows efficient use of storage space and handling of users' requests.

There is a [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html][VDT-based installation of dCache]].

See [[Documentation/StorageDcacheOverview][Overview of dCache for OSG]] for information.

---+++ Integration with the information system
Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. See the topic [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Providers]]  The SE does not collect or publish information independently.

---+++ More information
In order to learn more about dCache, please visit the [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/index.shtml][dCache official website.]] 

---++ Installation
---+++ Introduction 
The linked document describes the process for installing dCache in an Open Science Grid site using the dCache scripts. For an overview of dCache, see See [[Documentation/StorageDcacheOverview][Overview of dCache for OSG]] or [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/dcache-whitepaper-light.pdf][&#8220;dCache, the Overview&#8221; (PDF)]]. 

VDT provides a package for installing dCache. Instructions are provided at the VDT site: [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras/InstallingDcacheForOSG.html][Installing a dCache System for the Open Science Grid]]

---+++ More information

For further details on customizing dCache or installing it manually, see 
Installation in [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book/in.shtml][dCache, the Book]].

---++ Validation
Please perform [[ValidatingDcache][these simple tests]] to validate your SE before declaring it to be functional.
