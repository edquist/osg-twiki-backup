---+++What processes need to be stopped?

The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down, it may fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading (see sample shutdown session below):
d45 2
To shutdown <b>all</b> services:
/etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded stop   <b><i>(if installed and activated)</i></b>
/etc/init.d/gris stop
/etc/init.d/globus-ws stop
/etc/init.d/mysql  stop
/etc/init.d/MLD stop or $VDT_LOCATION/MonaLisa/Services/CMD/MLD stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/globus-ws stop
/etc/init.d/condor stop   <b><i>(or other installed job manager)</i></b>
&gt;   /etc/init.d/apache stop     <b><i>(if CEMon has been activated)</i></b>
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh

&gt;   /etc/init.d/condor stop   <b><i>(or other installed job manager)</i></b>
For the CRL update process:
<UL>
<LI> OSG 0.4.1 or prior, then:
<pre>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop </pre>
<LI> OSG 0.5.0 and beyond, this is a <i>root</i> cron process and you will need to turn it off by commenting it out or removing it:
&gt; <b>vdt-control --off </b>
34 5 * * * /usr/local/osg-ce/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
---++ Shutdown other services
</UL>
&gt;   /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop 
Bear in mind that !MonALISA also uses a database backend.  Here is how to find out whether [[MonALISA050][MonALISA]] is running, and if so, under what user:
0 0 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
=ps -efwww | grep -i monalisa=
0 0 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
and for the mysql or postgres daemons associated with !MonALISA, check using:
&gt; crontab -r -u mis
=ps -efwww | grep -i mysql=
==/etc/xinetd.d== services can be disabled by either removing the service configuration from the ==/etc/xinetd.d== direcotry, or setting ==disable=yes== in the service's ==/etc/xinetd.d== configuration file and restarting xinetd.
or
       or
=ps -efwww  | grep -i post[master,gres]=

If you are running a Rocks cluster, be sure to kill only the OSG-related mysql processes and avoid inadvertently stopping any cluster-related ones.  In general, pay attention if you need to kill any database-related processes explicitly; for example, look to make sure they are related to !MonALISA and/or are running out of your VDT installation area before stopping them.

If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you should
remove the =/etc/init.d/MLD= link if it exists, as this will link to the =ML_SER= in your old =$VDT_LOCATION=.

The process involves bringing down the tomcat servlet container, the included apache distribution, and mysql server.
