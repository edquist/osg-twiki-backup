---++ Getting started with authorization
You'll need to determine which which mode of authorization to use for your CE.   Guidance on this is provided in [[AboutAuthorizationForCE][About Authorization For CE]].
   * A note about edg-mkgridmap.  In early releases of OSG, the =edg-mkgridmap= script ran as a system service and installed in =/etc/init.d=.  In newer releases it gets installed as a _root_ crontab entry.  If you are upgrading from an early OSG release, you must stop the edg-mkgridmap daemon and delete that entry from system services.  %NOTE% =edg-mkgridmap= is not installed/configured by default.


---++ Implement the authorization mode
We point you off to a separate page for each option:
   * [[Grid3ModeAuthorization][Local]] - uses a grid-mapfile for authorizations (manually maintained or using =edg-mkgridmap= cron service)
   * [[CompatibilityModeAuthorization][Compatibility]] - uses a grid-mapfile for authorizations based on a GUMS service.
   * [[FullPrivilegeAuthorization][Full Privilege]] - the (role-based) extended-proxy certificate authorization mode using a GUMS service.

---++ Check supported VOs and Unix accounts
Beginning with OSG 0.6.0, one can verify that authorization works for the VOs supported, and that the required Unix accounts exist on the CE host.  This is further discussed in [[OsgSupportedVos][Supported VOs and Undefined UNIX Accounts]].

---++  Monitoring/publishing your authorization service via <nop>CEMon/GIP/BDII.
The authorization service used by a CE is monitored and published by the OSG information service for all 3 modes:
   * it identifies yous authorization mode as being either grid-mapfile based (Local and Compatibility modes) or GUMS based (Full Privilege mode)
   * for a Full Privilege (GUMS) based authorization service, it will periodically "probe" your GUMS service with an authorization request and report on the availability of the service.

This monitoring is automatically enabled on any %CACHE% CE node installation.

On the GUMS service side for Full Privilege mode, GUMS v1.2 or later is required.  This is done automatically when upgrading GUMS to v1.2 or when doing a fresh GUMS v1.2 install. 

If your GUMS version is not at this level, ask  your GUMS administrator to authorize a mapping for the information provider probe.  In case of problem, you can look at the manual version of the steps performed to authorize the authorization probe at the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.8.1/notes/GUMS.html][VDT GUMS release notes]].
