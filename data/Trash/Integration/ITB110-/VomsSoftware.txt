---++++ VDT 1.6.2
<pre>
You have installed a subset of VDT version 1.6.2:
You have installed a subset of VDT version 1.6.1a:
    Apache HTTPD 2.2.3
    CA Certificates v21 (includes IGTF 1.11 CAs)
    Fetch CRL 2.6.2
    GPT 3.2
    Java SDK 1.4.2_12
    Logrotate 3.7
    MySQL 4.1.21

    VOMS Admin (client 1.2.13, interface 1.0.3, server 1.2.15) 1.2.15-0
</pre>
You can use the =vdt-control= command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:

---++++/etc/init.d services
---+++ The init.d services that are included
<pre>
apache 
mysql         
tomcat-5    
voms    (this is the voms server use to handle voms proxies requests)
</pre>

In addition, during the installation, a test VO called =VDT= will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the =VDT= VO will have to be performed separately.
---++++cron services
=root= cron:
<pre>
CRL updates (fetch-crl.cron)
