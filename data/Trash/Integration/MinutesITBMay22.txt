   * BNL_ITB
      * Upgraded to 0.9.1 
      * Had a few authentication problems (sbgrid) but working on this
      * Problem with dcache SE -- problem with srm tester (srm-BringOnline)
   * UC_ITB
      * CE up
   * OUHEP_ITB
      * Updated to 0.9.1 
      * No problems with apache/certificates/syslog-ng
   * CIT_CMS_T2 
      * Problem with jobs getting stuck in queue in the last several days
      * Problem with ca-cert-updater but resolved
      * Ongoing gratia problem (site is reporting but usage information is missing) 
   * CIGI_ITB
      * 
   * LBNL
      * Things running smoothly
      * Going through validation
      * Seeing same problem as Michael but setting PER_JOB_HISTORY corrected problem
      * Will update worker node client

---++ Site Validation Table (Jeff)
   * Gratia problems (seen on CIT_CMS_T2 and LBNL)
   * RSV SE probes need to be updated to point to new srm client directory (will use Fermi client)
   * WLCG testing still ramping up
   * SE Validation
       * LBL probes failing -- *need to be chased down*
       * Instructions for installing other probes can be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB090/InstallationITBStorageElement][here]]
       * Gratia probes will be installed if an update of vdt dcache install is done (will need to manually enable gratia probes)
       * FNAL having problems with gratia reporting
       * Links to validation test suite that tests the femi client, space and replica manager can be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB090/InstallationITBStorageElement][here]] .  RPM there will provide files needed to test things
       * LBNL/UC_ITB will go through validation by May 27th

---++ VO Validation (Abhishek)
   * Things appear to be in good shape
   * Green flags from 4 VOs, should be able to meet deadline for a majority of VOs 
   * ATLAS currently validating on UC_ITB
   * CDF has validated opportunistic storage, now moving onto validating its application
   * In context of CDF, problems with FNAL KCA's non-standard DN tokens.
   * CIGI has validated opportunistic storage as well as application, at 4 sites. Will validate UC_ITB also 
   * CMS currently validating on UCSDT2-ITB1
   * DOSAR gave a green flag
   * Dzero ran into a problem at LBNL_DSD_ITB and will try to revalidate
   * Fermilab will do another final run this week
   * LIGO will try validating again at Caltech (will know today)
   * nanoHub gave a green flag
   * SBGrid is currently validating application (may try opportunistic storage if time exists)
   * SDSS/DES gave green flag - also tested opportunistic storage on FNAL, will try again with BNL
     
---++ Bugs / Action Items
   * BDII / Cemon
   * Dcache-gip / token info provider has an exception   
 
---++ Documentation (Rob) 
   * Rob Gardner is going through pages and commenting using review status page as guide
   * Questions/comments will appear over time
   * *We'll need to review several pages to make sure information is still up to date*
   * After review, reviewers can provide comment and name at the bottom of the page 
   * Any page with problem should have the completion flag changed from 3 to 2 so that it'll appear on the review status page
   * Will have a session on Tuesday to see if people are willing to review pages / documentation
   * *New rsv / registration documentation needs to be reviewed*
   * *Will need to make sure that references to configure-osg.sh updated*
   * *Need to remove orphaned pages*
