---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: Martin, Stu, Jeff, David, Suchandra, Rob 
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, May 8, 2007; 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MinutesMay1
   * Background
      * WSGramValidation060, and WsGramOsgSites
      * SysLogNg

---++ Syslog-ng status (for WS gram testing specifically)
   * Logger patch from Charles http://repo.mwt2.org/viewvc/patches/
   * VTB instructions VTBSyslogNG
   * Setup for uct3-edge5.  Suchandra is setting up a script to check the processes - will send off to Alain at VDT.  Will clean up if syslog-ng; restart, etc.

---++ OSG VTB site at UC (Suchandra)
   * New VTB site and phantom Condor Q - status is up and running. 
   * Still need to get martin login access

---++ New WS gram tests (Martin)
   * 500 job submission worked to edge5 from the UNL submit host.
   * 2000 job submission failed at both edge5 and the LIGO site.  
   * On edge5 the problem is security related - the server doesn't find credentials. ~1400 work fine, but the rest dont.
   * Using Condor as client, using previously described.
   * But curiously the UNL site is working well.
   * Slowly submitting means 20 jobs/resource.  Have been setting this to 2000 and letting Condor G do the job.  This had worked well.
   * Errors are coming from the container.  Stu thinks we need to look at the key condor parameters (jobs/resource; pending submit; to set for the configuration.
   * 4.0.3+patches versus 4.0.4 went out without all the patches.  There isn't a 4.0.5 yet.
   * Need to consult CMS/Nebraska as to their server setup.  Suchandra will contact Brian.  (Burt consulted - okay)
   * Need to do coordinated tests looking at:
      * submit host actions, behavior
      * host server load, etc
      * Condor behavior on both sites

---++ LBL WS host and client testing (Jeff)
   * Concerns about number of slots, even if these are sleep jobs. Consulting NERSC PBS experts.

---++ AOB
   * Alan S working on setting up a host setup for 1G WS gram recommendation; adding more physical memory.
   * David trying to get UW Milwaukee WS Gram setup - not getting support from GOC/VDT - perhaps tickets are not getting routed to VDT.
