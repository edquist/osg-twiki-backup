---++ Attending
   * Meeting attendees:  David, Martin, Stu, Suchandra, John R, Jeff, Xin, Anand, Shaowen, Karthik, Brian, Alain, Alex, Greg Cross, Michael
   * Apologies: Rob G, Horst

---++ WS gram testing (Scalability results from Martin and Jeff ) 
   * 500 submissions ok at all test sites.
   * 2000 submissions ok at UNL but not other sites. Martin is testing local calls to RFT instead of ws-gram calls to RFT to determine if this is a factor.
   * Martin believes there may be a problem with the interaction between gsi-security and ws-gram services that is affecting scalability.
   * Jeff is performing a parameter study by varying the Condor-G config parameter PENDING_SUBMITS from 50 to 20 as recommended by Stuart to determine if this improves scalability.
   * Horst is offering OUHEP_ITB with gatekeeper osgitb1.nhn.ou.edu for ws-gram testing. If you can't authenticate email Horst for support.

---++ Syslog-ng Logging infrastructure (Report from Brian T)
   * Logging server on uct3-edge5.  Configuration now stable. (Suchandra)
   * Logs are being forwared to LBNL for development of log parsing tools by Brian. Inital emphasis on tools for gatekeeper and gsiftp parsing. Brian is setting up Postgress DB for the LBNL repository.
   * Pacman package under development: Alain is making progress toward a Pacman release for further testing of Syslog-ng on the ITB.
   * Next step: Wider deployment on ITB.  Schedule TBD.
   * Suchandra brought up the issue that policy needs to be created to determine who has access to the central Syslog repositories before wider deployment on the ITB.

---++ Storage monitoring progress
   * Update from John R on the GOC-based storage verify script: The script itself is functional but some questions still persist in the handling of the GIP information.  Specifically, how to determine whether to run gsiftp tests.  Another issue is with gsiftp tests on systems that have implemented dCache.  These systems have something called GridFTP doors that changes the directory path.  There is currently no method of automatically discovering whether a site is using dCache or not. The software needed to export the test results from the testing system to VORS is in place and tested.  Several storage sites are now populated with test results on VORS.  These include T2_Nebraska_Storage and USATLAS_dCache_at_BNL on the production grid and UC_T2DEV_SE on the ITB. The information displayed on VORS from the testing system include the link to the raw test results and a table of VO's and their associated values of space available and space used.  The Resource General Information field is not currently populated.  Suggestions for the appropiate information to display here would be appreciated.  Anything published via the GIP could be published in that field.
      * 1. How often should sites be tested? 
      * 2. When to test gsiftp?  Currently, if a dn: GlueSEAccessProtocolLocalID=gsiftp is found for the SE then gsiftp is tested.  Recent discussions have suggested that this is not correct.
      * 3. Determining whether a resource is using dCache.  This changes the gsiftp test.  An appropiately constructed GlueServiceUniqueID would be nice here since it would provide system status information.
   * Update from Alex S on the srm-tester
      * Now five sites being monitored
      * Both srm v1, v2 and gsiftp are being tested.
      * srm-tester-v1 and srm-tester-v2 are in the VDT.
      * To add a site, the site administrator must register via information on the srm-tester Twiki page. Sites are not automatically added to the srm tester framework.

---++New OSG Interoperability Task
   * Collect requests for changes from Burt, Steve and others.
   * Analyze impact of changes
   * Test candidate changes on the ITB to determinine interoperability with:
      * batch schedulers
      * workflow planners and workload managers
      * event managers such as Condor-G/DAGMan
   * Focus on maintaining interoperability across the OSG and between the OSG and other grids (LCG, Teragrid).
   * Greg Cross is available to provide a report on OSG/Teragrid interoperability as part of this effort. Possibly at the May 17 ITB telecom.
