---++ GUMS coming (Gabriele)
   * Server improvements are coming - there is a GUI, with a standard OSG template.
   * Will introduce to the VTB.  Follow-up next week.

---++ Update on storage validation (John R)
   * Spoke with osg-storage, will start testing daily.  Has 6/13 SE's passing, which means that the copy commands are working.  Two sites not reporting BDII info.  Auth problems. 

---++ Update on GIP, storage attributes, etc (Anand)
   * Eric - has updated GIP to be Glue 1.3 compliant.  Will need to work the issue with *John R - will create VTB instance of Glue 1.3 BDII.*  Done, correct schema files loaded %Y%.
   * Next steps: more testing of GIPs in advance of VDT 1.7.1.  Quite a few bug fixes and feature enhancements.  
   * There is also a GIP validator now running from the GOC.  See http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu/.
   * There are problems with lsf information being reporting incorrectly - now fixed %Y%.
   * Working with osg-storage to get additional requirements.
   * The validator checks for schema correctness.

---++ Follow-up on Squid configuration preferences survey
   * From two meetings ago: _OSG_SQUID_LOCATION environmental variable that is set in configure-osg that we presently force users to use that want to use a site's squid cache from programs such as =wget=.  Should we set http_proxy directly, and not require users to use the environmental variable? Steve T thinks yes.  UCSD thinks not.  Discussed collecting more information in operations meetings - Rob Q will put this on the agenda of the next meeting(s).  Alain will provide the recipe for setting http_proxy directly._
   * Rob Q will bring this up at the next operations meeting. - no update.

---++ AOB
   * None.
