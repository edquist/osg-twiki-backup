---++ VDT Release Schedule

   * vdt-191 will be released soon (day or 2). VTB should do installs, run standard tests, & target the following
      * vdt-update-certs will now also provide initial cert deployment  - we need to check
      * Condor will be deployed (without option) as 'condor-cron' (sp?) with control commands separate from any local condor - test RSV is functional
   * After a quick turn arround the vtb, vdt 1.9.1 will be re-cached as vdt-1.10.0
      * the length of the turn around depends on current build failure on SLES 9  IA-64

      * ITB cache will be prepared
      * release documentation will be frozen and copied for ITB edits (Suchandra will check with Kyle)
