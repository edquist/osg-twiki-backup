---++Introduction

Introduction to the GT4 implementation of GridFTP.

---++Readiness Plan

The following is a simple outline for service proponents to follow while preparing services for the OSG integration testbed.

	 * Overall (brief) description of the service, and expected duration of the service within the ITB.

	 * Description of dependencies and interactions with other services.

	 * Resources required -- are clients/agents/info providers etc. to be installed on all sites?

	 * What are the server requirements (is a central discovery server /repository needed/provided, etc)?

	 * How is it packaged?

	 * Provide installation and configuration instructions.

	 * Provide a test harness -- that is, once installed, how does one understanding everything is working properly? Are all required functionality tests successful?

	 * Scalablity tests - what are the expectations in terms of performance and at what scale and in what metrics for successful integration.

	 * Contact information for support of the service in the integration phase (as distinct from production operations in the OSG).

	 * Links to documentation

---++ Validation Tests
