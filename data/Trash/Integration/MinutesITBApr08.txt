---++ ITB Robot (Jose / Maxim / Suchandra)
   * Comments from Maxim:
      * work on monitoring has resumed, eventually will result in an ITB Panda Monitor page, no ETA yet
         * If jobs are submitted using label, then a single url can be used to view all of these jobs
      * markup and parsing of the ITB job output needs to be revisited (status of gridftp transfer?)
         * Suchandra submitted some jobs to test this
      * issues highlighted by Jose -- where to host the collection and analysis service?  
      * Jose says myproxy can be used for a week without a password by default
      * Jose will add a verify option to make sure that the job url is accessible before submission
      * GLexec on fnal - waiting for myproxy client installs on worker node clients
   * Automated testing
       * Jobs will be submitted tonight, and report will be sent out tomorrow morning with results
