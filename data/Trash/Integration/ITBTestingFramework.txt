---++ Introduction
In order to improve testing of ITB resources, a few members of the ITB team in conjunction with ATLAS developers are working on following validation of ITB resources using the PANDA framework.  Ideally ITB admins will be able to define a queue configuration for their ITB resources and then subsequently submit a variety of validation jobs to their resource using a simple to use script.  The results of the validation jobs will then be available through a web interface so that integration testing of new release can be easily documented and archived.

One of the goals is to allow admins to download a script after setting up their ITB site and run a group of jobs on their newly configured site to exercise and verify various components are properly configured.  In addition, a web accessible record of the the tests will then be available as a reference so that the admin and the ITB team will have a record of the testing process.

---++ Running Jobs

---+++ Job types
Currently there are a limited number of job types.  The jobs are all hosted on a server at [[http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/jobs/][UChicago]].  The currently available jobs and urls for them are:
   * Hello world - http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/jobs/pilot_hello.py 
   * Cpu utilization task (matrix inversion) - http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/jobs/cpu_burn.py
   * Check accessibility and functionality of =OSG_DATA= = http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/jobs/check_osg_data.py
   * Check functionality of =OSG_WN_TMP= - http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/jobs/check_wn_tmp.py
---++ Queue and Site Information
   * [[http://panda.cern.ch:25980/server/pandamon/query?job=*&processingType=ITB_Integration&detail=no][Current queue]]
---+++ UC_ITB 
The UC_ITB resource is a small persistent ITB resource providing resources for testing.  The resource also has a bestman and a dcache SE associated with it.
