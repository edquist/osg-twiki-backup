---++ Introduction
In order to improve testing of ITB resources, a few members of the ITB team in conjunction with ATLAS developers are working on following validation of ITB resources using the PANDA framework.  Ideally ITB admins will be able to define a queue configuration for their ITB resources and then subsequently submit a variety of validation jobs to their resource using a simple to use script.  The results of the validation jobs will then be available through a web interface so that integration testing of new release can be easily documented and archived.
