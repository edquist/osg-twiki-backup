---++ITB Participation
Here we write down some notes regarding how site administrators participate in the OSG ITB activity. It is expected that the level of effort will vary over the course of the activity with intense installation sessions followed by periods of relative calm.  This timing is driven by the availability and schedules of new services making their way into the OSG.  On average, 1/4 FTE is usually required for participation.

---++Site Registration
Note from Ruth (5/24/05) which is a lightweight proposal for a testbed site registration procedure for ITB participants.  This serves two purposes – to let the operations team know some basic contact information, and to transmit certain information to GridCat informing the developer (Bockjoo) that a new site is to be added.

To register, please email the following  to igoc at ivdgl.org - copy/paste the text 
below in the body:

<verbatim>
Short_Site_Name
Host_Name
SystemAdmin email
System Admin phone
$app path name
$data path name
$tmp path name
$wntmp path name
</verbatim>


---++Installation Guide for Core Services

We are currently Twiki-wording the installation procedures for OSG site adminstrators. Here is where we hope all site admins will jump in and edit, provide comments, etc, based on their experiences.

	* OSGCoreInstallGuide gives the common, essential installation instructions in Twiki
	* The legacy, html-based [[OsgItbInstallation][quick installation]] instruction guide

---++Site Level VO Management
"I am a *VO manager*! What should I do for my VOMS? And the GUMS! Oh my god! I am doomed!" read the PrivilegeVOWhatToDo.

"I am a *site administrator*! Where do I get GUMS!?! And the maps! Oh my god! I am doomed!" read the PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo.

"I am a poor and *simple user*! What should I do to use VOMS? And GUMS? And the maps! Oh my god! I am doomed!" read the PrivilegeUserWhatToDo.

Recommendations for site-level VO management are found on the PrivilegeOSG web.
