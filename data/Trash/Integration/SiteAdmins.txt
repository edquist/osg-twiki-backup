---++ Known Problems

   * This is will be an overview document but has not been updated since November 05.
   * %RED% Created OverviewGuide rather than try to retrofit this page, for now at least - R. Gardner (3/22/06) %ENDCOLOR%

---++ITB Participation Requirements
To participate in the OSG ITB activity, we require:
   * Site admins: approximately 0.25 FTE (full-time equivalent) level of effort during a specific integration period (such as during preparation of the OSG 0.1.5 release candidate).
   * Service providers: that support for the service being introduced be delivered in a responsive and timely manner, and that adherence to service readiness and integration plans is followed.
   * For VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators, that support is given in a timely way to achieve VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-specific and multi-VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo objectives, consistent with commitments given within the OSG Deployment Activity.
   * For application validation teams, that testing and validation are delivered consistent with commitments given within the OSG Deployment Activity.
   * That all participants activity contribute to the knowlege base of the Activity by editing twiki pages, developing new webs and categories if need be, by providing feedback to osg-int@opensciencegrid.org, etc.  *The goal of the integration activity is not to simply get _your_ site running, but to develop reproducible procedures and accurate documentation to be used for large scale deployment.*
   * All ITB sites are expected to support all VOs participating in the OSG integration activity.  _Note: this is not assumed to carry forward into *Deployment*, in which a given site is not expected to support every VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo participating in the OSG.  This must be negotiated within the Operations-Provisioning-Deployment context._

These requirements are not expected to persist once a specific integration cycle is complete. 

---++Site vs Facility
In the OSG, a 'site' is defined as a set of associated services provided under a single administrative domain (and often a single system administraor's control).  Larger _facilities_ may support multiple _sites_. The sites may share certain services at that facility.  An example of such a shared service is [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/index.html GUMS]]. 
Thus, as site administrator you may or may not be responsible for a GUMS service.  

%RED% Comments on the documentation: %ENDCOLOR%
(I find the above confusing. What question are we trying to address here ? dane)
(Anne 5/25 -- This is how I understand it . I moved it up to here, and removed text " The first step is to determine your privilege model and context.  PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo has a flowchart guide meant to help you determine this. The GumsAdmins topic discusses installation and configuration for GUMS Adminsitrators." because I think it doesn't belong here)


---++Installation Guide for a OSG Default Compute Element
We are currently Twiki-wording the installation procedures for OSG CE adminstrators. Here is where we hope all site admins will jump in and edit, provide comments, etc, based on their experiences.
   * To shut down OSG services prior to doing an upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
   * OSGCEInstallGuide gives the common, essential installation instructions to install a basic OSG Compute Element.  
   * Additional Optional Services useful a CE site admin
      * [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][Discovery Service (jClarens)]]: DiscoveryServiceInstallation provides install and configuration instructions.
      * The GUMS service (see below and OsgCEAuthorization for information, GumsAdmins for install guide).


---++Quick Validation
Once installation is complete, site administrators will want to perform checks themselves to validate their installation and conf
iguration. 

   * SiteVerify can be used to check the core infrastructure
   * GoldenChainDebugging documents various tests to determine what might be wrong if a SiteVerify fails on Authentication.
   
---++Site Registration



To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog,
please use the [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu][OSG GOC webform.]]. 
If you are registering into the ITB, please add this as a note in the section provided under resource name.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a site to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make site and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.


---++VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Management (by your affiliated VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo admins)
As a resource administrator, you are affiliated with one or more VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's.  The following are links that your affiliated VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo adminstrators are using to setup VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-level services. They are provided here for your general information.

   * The Privilege Project implements fine-grained authorization which involves interaction between the site and the VO. The PrivilegeOSG page describes the projects components.
   * The VoAdmins page provides pointers to other pages with detailed information regarding the setup and maintenance of VOs and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-related software.
   * The VomsWhatToDo page describes how to setup the required infrastructure for a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo on your linux machine (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS is required for OSG participation).
