---++ITB Participation
To participate in the OSG ITB activity, we require:
	* Site admins: approximately 0.25 FTE level of effort during a specific integration period (such as during preparation of the OSG 0.1.5 release candidate).
	* Service providers: that support for the service being introduced be delivered in a responsive and timely manner, and that adherence to service readiness and integration plans is followed.
	* For VO administrators, that support is given in a timely way to achieve VO-specific and multi-VO objectives, consistent with commitments given within the OSG Deployment Activity.
	* For application validation teams, that testing and validation are delivered consistent with commitments given within the OSG Deployment Activity.
	* That all participants activity contribute to the knowlege base of the Activity by editing twiki pages, developing new webs and categories if need be, by providing feedback to osg-int@opensciencegrid.org, etc.  *The goal of the integration activity is not to simply get _your_ site running, but to develop reproducible procedures and accurate documentation to be used for large scale deployment.*
	* All ITB sites are expected to support all VOs participating in the OSG integration activity.  _Note: this is not assumed to carry forward into *Deployment*, in which a given site is not expected to support every VO participating in the OSG.  This must be negotiated within the Operations-Provisioning-Deployment context._

These requirements are not expected to persist once a specific integration cycle is complete. 

---++Site Registration
Site administrators *must* fill-out a lightweight form. This serves two purposes: (1) to let the operations team know some basic contact information, and (2) to collect certain information required by GridCat (this will likely change in the future). When you have the information in hand, please email the following to igoc@ivdgl.org (copy/paste the text below in the body):

<verbatim>
Short_Site_Name
Host_Name
SystemAdmin email
System Admin phone
$app path name
$data path name
$tmp path name
$wntmp path name
</verbatim>


The registration process is:

	1 Email to the igoc with the registration information above.
	1 igoc executes site_verfify.pl on the site and some other cursory tests. 
	1 When the tests succeed the igoc sends a message to the GridCat admin to add the new site.
	1 GridCat admin adds the new site and completes the registration.


---++VO Level VO Management
As a resource administrator, you are affiliated with one or more VO's.  The following are links that your affiliated VO adminstrators are using to setup VO-level services. They are provided here for your general information.

	* The VoAdmins information is available to setup the required infrastructure for a VO.
	* PrivilegeVOWhatToDo gives an overview for VO administrators on how to use the VO attributes.  Additional information is available at the PrivilegeOSG web.


---++Installation Guide for a OSG Default Compute Element
We are currently Twiki-wording the installation procedures for OSG CE adminstrators. Here is where we hope all site admins will jump in and edit, provide comments, etc, based on their experiences.
	* To shut down OSG services prior to doing an upgrade, see the OSGShutdownGuide.
	* OSGCEInstallGuide gives the common, essential installation instructions to install a basic OSG Compute Element.  
	* Additional Optional Services useful a CE site admin
		* [[http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaeweb/wiki/index.php/ClarensDiscoveryService][Discovery Service (jClarens)]]: DiscoveryServiceInstallation provides install and configuration instructions.
		* The GUMS service (see below and OsgCEAuthorization for information, GumsAdmin for install guide).

---++Site and Facility Level Privilege Management
In the OSG, a 'site' is defined as a set of associated services provided under a single administrative domain (and often a single systems administraor's control).  Larger _facilities_ may support multiple _sites_, which may share certain services at that facility.  An example of such a service is *GUMS*. Thus, as site administrator you may or may not be responsible for a GUMS service.	The first step is to determine your privilege model and context.  PrivilegeSiteWhatToDo has a flowchart guide meant to help you determine this. The GumsAdmins topic discusses installation and configuration for GUMS Adminsitrators.

(I find the above confusing. What question are we trying to address here ? dane)

---++Quick Validation
Once installation is complete, site administrators will want to perform checks themselves to validate their installation and conf
iguration. 

	* SiteVerify can be used to check the core infrastructure
	* GoldenChainDebugging documents various tests to determine what might be wrong if a SiteVerify fails on Authentication.
