	Rob,

	Our comments on the current set of attributes would be that
they may represent policy violation at certain sites depending on
how they are collected. Explicitly:

- Association of any combination of OS version+kernel+... and a
  node name or IP is not considered a safe practice at BNL (expose
  possible vulnerability by providing too much information).
  Aggregate information is fine. While this is a discussion on
  useful attribute, the way they will be gathered is important.
  I have informed the facility manager and hope further comments
  and interaction will come from that direction.

- Related: how dynamic those attribute need to be updated is
  uncertain ... Farms are re-configured frequently, upgraded,
  etc ... and the definition of sub-cluster is stringent and add
  operational burden.

- I find that providing information such as
  GlueHostBenchmarkSF00 or GlueHostBenchmarkSI00 is an overkill.
  Are the site admin expected to run a test suite? Copy the information
  from spec.org ?? Why providing such info in the first place since
  (a) we could use spec.org information and (b) if we provide
  information ourselves (no need to explain the benefits), the
  results will be inconsistent across the OSG facility [unless we
  provide ur own set of test suite].

	Hope this helps,

	Cheers,
