---++ BOSCO Testing 
[[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing.pdf][bosco-testing.pdf]] gives an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

The three main use cases are:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing.

---++ Feedback to Developers
S.Tim recommended to check with the Gratia operators (people maintaining the service for OSG) before deciding which accounting information will go there form BOSCO.
He is worried about the load, specially since most of the BOSCO installers and operators will not be expert sysadmins.

This will be taken into consideration for BOSCO 1.2 (scheduled to provide Gratia accounting)

---++ Installation support and issue tracking

---++ AOB  

---+ Tasks

Marco will advertise to ITB when a good Beta release is available.

Xin and Steve will perform some basic testing.
Horst offered to catch up and to perform some tests as well.

Marco and Derek will follow up on Steve observations before 1.2.

Next meeting is 12/27.
