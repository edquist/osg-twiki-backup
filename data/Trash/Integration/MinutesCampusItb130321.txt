---++ BOSCO Testing 
[[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

The three main use cases are:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check Trash/Trash/CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing.

---++ Feedback to Developers

---++ Installation support and issue tracking

The download links for the platform specific tarballs are confusing. There are no instructions on what to do with them to install Bosco


---++ AOB  
   * Next meeting will be on 4/4

<!--
- Recruitment of early testers, starting with Trash/Integration community but open to others
- Providing testers with precise instructions most useful to the BOSCO development team
- Defining specific tests for various platforms and modes

        > single user versus multi-user
        > platforms
        > target clusters
        > required functional testing
        > scale testing
        > operational issues, monitoring

- Collection of feedback
- Tracking issues and bringing to bosco development group
