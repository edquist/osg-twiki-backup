---++ Attending
   * Brian, Alain, Rob, Suchandra, Charles, Martin, Rob

---++ Syslog-ng + Stunnel (Brian)
There are lots of web pages that describe how to set this up:
   * http://www.stunnel.org/examples/syslog-ng.html
   * http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_create_a_logserver_with_syslog-ng
   * http://librenix.com/?inode=7126
   * http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/features/articles/syslog_ng.html?biga=15
   * Unfortunately different OSes and different flavors of Linux all put things like the cert files in a different location. So getting the pacman install scripts right will be rather tricky.
   * Minor mods to syslog-ng.conf on both ends.  stunnel.conf on both ends.
   * The issue is an operational one - how to distribute the public keys.  
   * Brian will provide a twiki as a reference point for deployment onto VTB sites.

---++ WS gram
   * Martin reports that Jeff's tests are working fine now, but there were some problems overnight.  Jeff will send out mail with the details.  
   * Current scale is about 800 jobs.  What was the load?  Can we scale up?
   * We need to complete this work, summarize in a report,  and make recommendations for OSG 0.8 within the next two weeks.

---++ VTB
   * Suchandra will update VTB cache to VDT 1.7.1.  
   * Need to test at UC, Caltech, LBL, IU, FNAL VTB sites.
