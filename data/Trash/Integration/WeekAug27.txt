---+ Trash/Integration Report for Week of Aug 27, 2007

---++ Individual reports
   * Reports from [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/wiki/bin/view/OSG/WeekAug27][Suchandra Thapa]], [[Trash/Integration.JeffPorterWeeklyAug27][Jeff Porter]] and [[Trash/OSGReports.RobWeekAug27][Rob Gardner]], [[Trash/OSGReports.CharlesHuang][Charles Huang]]

---++ Meetings
   * Tuesday's integration meeting: Trash/Integration.MinutesAug28
   * Thursday's integration meeting: Trash/Integration.MinutesAug30

---++ Summary 
   * Work this week focused on validation of ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome, the results being summarized in the ReleaseDocumentation.SiteValidationTable.  There will likely not be much testing of either Squid (no perceived urgency from users, except CDF) or glexec (which is in VDT but is not easily installed, and again, no urgent demand by sites other than Fermilab at this time.)  A set of "persistent" sites have agreed to operationally support all VOs preparing to validate their applications on the ITB.   The BDII server at the GOC has been upgraded with the right schema, clearing the way for interoperability with the LCG pre-production service.  A number of RSV issues emerged but all seem to have been resolved.
