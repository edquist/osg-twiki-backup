---+VORS Service Readiness Plan
---++Introduction
The Virtual Organization Resource Selector provides a top-level view of
computational or storage resources available across multiple grids and
regions of the world filtered by each resource's support for a particular
Virtual Organization.
                                                                                
---++Description of the Service
  VORS is a top-level monitor and resource catalog
only.  It uses other testing facilities to provide status and any other
additional dynamic information that is displayed.  The resource list is
actively maintained by the Operations staff to ensure that the static
information concerning a resource is as accurate as possible.                                                                                

---++Dependencies and Other Services
VORS is highly dependent on other services to provide any dynamic
information displayed.  The primary dependency is on the Operations
registration database.  This is the only entry point for resources to
be added to VORS.  Currently, the only remote dependency is the GridScan
tool.  This tool sequentially tests all the OSG production and ITB sites using
the site_verify script.  The results are used by VORS for status and detailed
information concerning a particular site.

---++Required Resources
VORS does not require anything from the resources other than registration
in the Operations database.
                                                                                
---++Server Requirements
Server requirements pertain mostly to software.  VORS requires a mysql
database instance (though not necessarily on the same machine), a web
server, and the Imagemagick library.
                                                                                
---++Packaging
VORS will be distributed using pacman.
                                                                                
---++Installation and Configuration
VORS requires no installation or configuration on individual resources.
Complete installation and configuration information for the server can be
found in the README file packaged along with the software.
                                                                                
---++Test Harness
VORS provides administration displays that confirm the acquisition and
reconstruction of data as it occurs.  These are always available and are
used to insure that fresh information is being acquired and displayed.
                                                                                
---++Validation
VORS should provide excellent scalability due to its top-level only design in
that it does not have to manage tests of any kind and does not contact
individual resources directly.  Also, VORS uses seperable 'monitors' to
interface with those services providing dynamic information making it
possible, if necessary, to locate those portions on other servers.
                                                                                
Some known issues with VORS include some amount time lag in retrieving test
information from other services as well as its dependency on other services
for test information.  Another known issue is the possible mismatch between
a resource's registered unique name (which is entered at registration) with
that specified on the resource proper.  This is partially mitigated through
the use of both the unique name and a gatekeeper host name as keys to an
individual resource throughout VORS.  Mismatches are flagged to the VORS
administrator should they occur.
