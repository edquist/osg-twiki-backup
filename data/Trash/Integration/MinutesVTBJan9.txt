---+!! VTB Meeting, January 9, 2007
%TOC%

---++ Attending
   * Rob Q, Rob, Alain, John R, Suchandra, John W, Marco, Jeff, David

---++ OSG attributes
Suchandra's report:
   * Meeting notes MinutesAttributesJan8
   * Summary of OSG configuration, http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Main/OSGConfigurationParameters
   * Waiting on Anand for new =configure-gip.sh=.
   * GIP attributes - we are using a subset only. 

---++ Gratia testing
   * John W - not installed.
   * Jeff - installs fine, created an 
   * Gratia probes added to VTB cache by Suchandra
   * David - will install after this meeting.
   * John R - not installed yet.
   * Suchandra - has not installed.

---++ Squid testing
   * Separate in the VTB
   * Suchandra - installs, configures, starts up properly.
   * Any other tests?

---++ CEMon and BDII testing
   * configure-cemon - probably okay.
   * CEM configuration is installed as part of the VTB ("OSG") cache, not in the VDT cache.
   * "res1" will be production, "res4" for the ITB. 
   * once cemon is running, export ldiff to bdii, and check information is being accurately reported.


---++ Relating to VDT 1.6.1

Alains questions:

<pre>
Here are questions I have for the VTB folks:
1) Has anyone tried out Gratia?
2) Has anyone tried out the new facility for preserving configuration?
3) Any comments on the new vdt-control program?
4) Have you seen anything suspicious or odd in the vdt-install.log file?
5) How does the post-install directory look to you, particularly the README file?
By the way, we updated to Condor 6.8.3 in VDT 1.6.1 last Friday. It shouldn't cause any problems, and should fix bugs.

Question 2)
   * Can define an OLD_VDT location - to bring old configuration information into the new installation.  Eg., voms, gums, previously answered questions.  
   
Question 3) vdt-control program
   * John W - its very good; need to document it. (there is documentation on the VDT 1.6.1 documentation page) 
 
   * Few hours of work remaining.


---++ ITB 0.5.2 transition and prep

   * Will create an ITB cache manually for ITB 0.5.2, which will be the primary cache.
   * Will also setup an SVN-based cache and test this out.


---++ Poll of readiness
   * David: probe install; then CEmon.  Needs two days.
   * Suchandra: 3 days, but need Anand 
   * John W: will take a couple of days.
