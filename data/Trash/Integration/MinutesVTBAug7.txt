---++ WS-Gram Testing Results (Suchandra)
   * See https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/WSGramTesting
   * We are interpreting these results.
   * There are four parameters that should be specified in the report.
   * RFT local calling was not enabled (its not enabled in default VDT).  Stu notes that we should see improvements when local calls are enabled.
   * gt2 vs. gt4: use gt2 as a reference.
   * prima vs gridmap: adds load due to connections to GUMS. 
   * staging benchmarks
   * start-end for whole batch; start-end for each job; time for gram to clean up to done;
   * Condor-G variable - with latest 6.9.4 release.

---++ AOB
   * Need to histogram and plot these results.
   * Suchandra will pull out the specific measures (timings) from the logfiles, and commnicate these to Martin and the group.
   * Update WSGramValidation060 with the latest results.
