---++Figure out what to do

Definitions:
	* Role based authorization: a user can get a different extended proxy from the VO VOMS server. This says, for example, that in a moment he is acting as a member of the analysis group, and the other is acting as a production coordinator. Role based authorization will allow you to map the user to a different account depending on the role.
	* Account pools: as implemented by GUMS, work as follow: GUMS will assign to each DN one account. The user will be mapped always to the same DN from then on. Accounts won't be created or recycled by GUMS. You can choose to have one or more pools (for example, a pool for VO, a pool for group in VO, a pool for role in a VO, a pool for groups accross VO, etc...)
	* Central management: it means being able to control all gatekeepers access from a single file, and not having to look/change configuration on each gatekeeper.

---+++ Full privilege site configuration
In this configuration, you will have:
	* A GUMS server at your site to manage the mapping
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with the PRIMA module to connect to the GUMS server for each gatekeeper request
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with gums-host to retrieve the accounting inverse map in a cron job
So you need to:
	* Install GUMS at your site
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Configure the PRIMA module on your gatekeeper(s)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ Compatibility site configuration
You do not _require_ the full privilege site configuration, but it's advisable. You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. Also, you will introduce delays since each gatekeeper will have to regenerate the map before implementing the new policy or allowing new users. You should fall back to this configuration if:
	* Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured through grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipolate that file directly, without passing through globus)
	* The idea of running GUMS 24/7 scares the hell out of you, and you'd rather approach with caution.
In this configuration, you will have:
	* A GUMS server at your site to manage the mapping
	* Your gatekeeper(s) configured with gums-host to retrieve both maps in a cron job
So you need to:
	* Install GUMS at your site
	* Configure it (if the default OSG policy is not good enough for you)
	* Install and configure gums-host on your gatekeeper(s)

---+++ "Ye olde grid3" site configuration
You do not _require_ "full privilege" or "compatibility", but you still can use them if you want. You'll probably prefer this configuration if:
	* You are a small site (one gatekeeper)
In this configuration, you will have:
	* The EDG mkgridmap creating the grid-mapfile running as a cron job

---++Do it!

---+++ Install GUMS
VDT installatio is NOT available for ITB 0.1.4 (VDT 1.3.3). Install GUMS from the following page:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html

---+++ Configure GUMS
You can start with the StandardOSGGUMSConfiguration.

You can then read the configuration guide:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_configuration.html
and the gums.config reference:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_config_gums.html
to explore more options.

---+++ Configure the PRIMA module
PRIMA comes with your VDT installation, you will just need to change a couple of configuration files.

You can find documentation on how to activate the PRIMA Authorization module in VDT to query a GUMS Identity Mapping Service at: https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-policy/vo-privilege: Title: "Activating the PRIMA Authorization Module in VDT 1.3.1". 

Also on this site is a document with the URLs of two test GUMS Servers that may be used for evaluation: Title: "GUMS Mapping Servers for ITB 0.1.0". 

---+++ Install and configure gums-host
Install the GUMS Client, following instructions at:
http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_howto_installation.html
They are toward the end.

---+++ Install and configure EDG mkgridmap
It will come prepackaged and preconfigured with the OSG installation. You just need to check the deamon "edg-gridmapfile-upgraded" is running.
