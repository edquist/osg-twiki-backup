---++ News from the facility deputy (Todd) 
   * OSG 1.0 is coming.  Timeline: VDT release in mid-March.  OSG 1.0 release targeted for May 1.
      * System !OpenSLL
      * New VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS
      * AIX and Debian support
      * New gridftp
   * Update to VDT 1.8.1 next week - with new dCache version 1.8 which adds support SRM v2.2.
   * Policy issues for RSV, public/private information, especially w/ regards to WLCG.
   * Concern about cron jobs - esp those dealing w/ security related info (fetchers of crls, etc).  Cron jobs are not managed - little centralized management control.
   * Blacklisting users - a user may break OSG policy, but not have their cert revoked.   For individual users - you could use SAZ. Not in VDT but could be.
   * Changing mechanisms by which the crl invocations happen - right now through VDT, thinking about migrating it to the Operations.

---++ Status of OSG 0.8 deployments and feedback (Rob Q)
   * A bit over 56% OSG 0.6 have deployed to OSG 0.8.  No OSG 0.4 sites left.
   * Troubleshooting/operations campaign is there but not heavily used.  Seems installation process is quite a bit smoother compared to previous releases.
   * Configuration of RSV is not trivial - but we're working on it.  Expect improvements in OSG 1.0.
   * No gripes from the group at this time.
   * Chris Green notes there may be a race condition during installation whereby the Gratia probe may become activated before the osg-user-vo-map.txt file is updates. 


---++ Reports from OSG Users (Chris Green) 
   * Lots of sites not reporting to !ReSS
   * OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo operations support.  Most common problem is local accounts are not created.
   * 50% of OSG sites do not the OSG VO.  (40 sites)
      * Why?
      * Rob Q - notes this may be intentional, but it may be lack of attention.
   * RSV probes can be used at some point in the future.  Gabriele in discussions with RSV team about this.  Hopefully in time for March 15.
   * There will be a panel at the site admins workshop next month.


---++ Lightning talk: progress on WS Gram testing (Jeff Porter)
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/ws-gram-testing-siteadmin.ppt][ws-gram-testing-siteadmin.ppt]]: ws-gram testing lightning talk
   * WSGramValidation
   * Several people have contributed to this work - Suchandra, Terrence, Stu, ...
