---++ Introduction
Subversion is a source code management system that allows all revisions to files it is managing to be tracked with comments.  It allows changes to be reverted if needed and provides a way of tracking the history of changes to a given set of files.  The subversion home page is located at http://subversion.tigris.org/ and there is an online book on using svn at http://svnbook.red-bean.com/. 

The VTB subversion repository is located at http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu and can be accessed using a svn client using the url http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/[repository] where repository is the appropriate repository.  Alternatively a web browser can be used to examine it using http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu .  

---++ Subversion basics 
For simplicity, the following instructions assume that the command line subversion client (i.e. =svn=) is being used. 
The basic workflow for using subversion would be to checkout a working copy from the repository using =svn checkout _url_=  where =_url_= is the url to the subversion repository (e.g. http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/cache ).  Files may then be modified and then committed to the repository using =svn commit= , at this point subversion will open an instance of the system text editor so that you can enter a commit message that will be associated with that commit.  =svn commit -m "commit message"= can also be used to avoid the invocation of the text editor.  To receive any updates that may have been made to the repository for your working copy, =svn update= can be invoked.  =svn status _file_= can be used to get the status of a file or directory, omitting the file or directory will give the status of all the files and subdirectories of the current directory. Finally, =svn export url= can be used to export from the repository.   

Subversion has the facility for keeping branches of a repository.  A branch can be considered to be an alternate but related copy of the files being kept in the main trunk. The main trunk can be considered to be the main copy of the files under source control.  It's usually where all of the changes are being made.  Branches are alternate copies for example in the VTB cache there are branches for the 1.5.2, 1.6.0 and 1.6.1 releases of the VTB cache.  Files in a branch can be altered and the changes committed to that file without affecting the corresponding file in the main trunk or other branches.  These changes can then later be copied to the corresponding files in other branches or the trunk or vice versa.  

To access the main trunk for the cache repository use http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/cache/trunk as the svn url.  The various branches can be accessed as http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/cache/branch/1.5.2, http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu/svn/cache/branch/1.6.0, etc.  

---++ Clients
The repository is using subversion 1.4.2 so clients used should be compatible with that version.  Clients compiled against subversion 1.4.x should be okay.   

---+++ Linux/Unix 
   * svn command line client (=svn=)
   * eSVN gui client ( http://esvn.umputun.com/ )

---+++ Mac OS X
   * svnX ( http://www.lachoseinteractive.net/en/community/subversion/svnx/ )
   * command line client ( http://www.codingmonkeys.de/mbo/ )

---+++ Windows 
   * !TortoiseSVN ( http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ )

---++ Web interface
A web interface to all of the VTB repositories is available at http://vtb-svn.uchicago.edu .  Clicking on a repository will give you a view of the branches, tags, and trunk for that repository.  Clicking on the arrow to the left of the directory or file name or the name will open up that file or directory.  For any entry, clicking on the inspect icon to the right of the will give you a changelog of revisions that affected that entry.  For each revision entry, you can click on a filename in the details of that revision to get more information on what changed (e.g. get a diff from the previous revision, etc.)
