---+++ Introduction
This page has the update and testing instructions for the osg 1.2.2 update.

---+++ Schedule
  * Sept 3-4: Testing started for gip/rsv/configure-osg testing
  * Sept 11: 
  * Sept 14: lcg utilities testing starts
  * Sept 21: Testing completion

---+++ Installation 
Admins will need to install from the VTB cache.  The packages being tested are located in the CE so only the CE will need to be tested for this update.  You can install the software using =pacman -get VTB:ce= .  


---+++ Testing and Validation
---++++ Testing GIP changes
In order to test the gip changes, you will need to add a hepspec option to your subcluster sections.  Then go to the myosg gip validation status page for your resource and then verify that the hepspec attribute is present and reporting the correct value.  For testing purposes, using an arbitrary integer should be sufficient.

The information team will also check values as reported to the central collector.

---++++ Testing configure-osg changes
The changes in configure-osg are primarily bug fixes so verifying functionality will just consist of making sure that configuration of your gatekeeper is done correctly. Testing job manager functionality, gridftp functionality, and reporting should be sufficient.

For admins using sge, configuration has changed.  You will need to set fill in values for =sge_root= and =sge_cell= in the =[SGE]= section.  However, you can remove the =home= and =sge_location= options since those are no longer used.  Once these changes are made, you should be able to configure your system as normal and go through the verification as above.

---++++ RSV probe testing
Forthcoming

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the vdt support center or any other support center as the receipient since that will cause a email loop*
