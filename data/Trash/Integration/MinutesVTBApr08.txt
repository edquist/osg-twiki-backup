---++ Introduction

   * Attendees:  Suchandra, Jeff, John, Alain
   * Apologies: 
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 4:00pm Central; 510-665-5437, *#1212*

---++ VTB test round table on:

   * Basic validations
      * gram/gridftp - Condor and PBS sites tested 
      * GIP/CEMon/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS 
         * John's 1.9.1 condor-site looked ok after quick check from Tanya, but hasn't looked at 1.10.0 install
         * Jeff reports some PBS problems remain in 1.10.0 (gip.conf defaults) but work after hand edits
         * new SE information - no one has tested yet. Suchandra will try after reinstall of d-cache
      * RSV 
         * new configuration - Latest version tested by Jeff with service cert. 
         * new probes 
            * GUMS: probe failed but Jeff, Jay, & Arvind are following up on it
            * SE:  not yet tested. Suchandra hopes to test later this week.
      * Gratia - looks ok from Jeff. Neither John or Suchandra have looked yet.
      * Syslog-ng - Jeff reports connection refused. Suchandra will investigate
      * Clients - Jeff installed & tested client, will look at wn-client later
   * Other Servers
      * GUMS - Both Jeff and John have installed/tested new GUMS
      * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS - John has been fighting this one
         * hopefully it is mostly documentation issues
         * voms-proxy-info return codes have changed and affect scripting
      * SE 
         * dcache - Suchandra plans on new install this week
         * bestman  - Jeff work on this later this week

---++ AOB

   * VDT 1.10.0 release will be official once release notes are produced (tonight/tomorrow)
   * ITB cache will be prepared tomorrow afternoon 
   * Jeff asked about having init file names be vdt/osg specific. e.g. ==/etc/init.d/mysql-osg== instead of ==/etc/init.d/mysql==
      * Can be done, probably on a case by case basis, but not a priority
      * John notes that this is not an uncommon stumbling block
