---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Validation on ITB (Abhishek)
   * Email sent to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo representatives - expect response by end of the week.  Will also get into touch 
   * CMS and D0 have responded already, more info on timeframes.  More information next week.
   * Fermilab, LIGO and GROW have already validated.
      * LIGO - wants more testing, and better understanding of cause of failures at sites.  David has segmented the validation table.  Some sites have very low priority.
      * Fermigrid mostly auth issues - needs Keith Chadwicks certificate.  

---++ Overview of the validation (David M)
   * Last week:
      * See SiteValidationTableITB052
      * See discussion above about sorting the sites in terms of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo application readiness.
      * Site admins - please communicate issues to David M.
   * Planned validation tests
      * !ReSS: two stages - is CEMon working at your site;  second - a query from a remote host.  The next step would be to validation the attributes from GIP.  What about longitudinal tests - eg., daily reports/summaries of tests.  Gabriele: will work on a script to do this, also Keith has a webpage with archived.
      * GIP from BDII - Anand developing a webpage to query BDII and moving from GridCat to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS.  Should be available next week - John R on hand for an interface to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS.
         * Will check that all are present, and for some attributes.
   * GridEx results - mailed.

---++ CEMon stability and native dialect backport (Tanya)
   * Alain: Tanya sent a new version of the sensor.  Fixes memory problem, and provides new method to collect all the information, not just a subset.  Does require a configuration change.  Tim C is putting this into VDT.  Chances good we have a solution.   Would like to get testing on the VTB going. 
   * Tanya - thinks we should test.

---++ Progress on CEMon reporting to BDII (John R)
   * BDII server - people can query this.
   * Pulls from a queue, must be less than 10 minutes old.  Thus ages information just like the original. 
   * All working now.  Waiting for validation from GROW.

---++ VDT 1.6.1a schedule and VTB testing cycle (Alain)
   * BDII also almost in VDT.
   * Good chance that updates to cemon later this afternoon.
   * Could release anytime theoretically.
   * Globus security patch, a site verify update, would like to get these in.
   * Proposal is two days of testing on VTB, then release 1.6.1a.
   * Will merge back into the same cache.
   * Then the ITB can do a pacman -update, we think.
   * Then there are changes to the OSG config scripts - Rob Q will check into this.
   * VTB testing sites: CIT, LBL, CIT, FNAL will cycle.

---++ OSG SE testing (Suchandra)
   * Setting up a SE using SRM/dCache on UC_T2DEV_ITB.  Notes are being collected, best practices.
   * What about the srm tester package?
   * Bockjoo has detailed script recipe - John will send to Rob; need to scriptify for gridscan.

---++ WS Gram validation (Jeff P)
   * See site valiation table.
   * 3 sites working fine.
   * several could not establish a connection.
   * several failed outright. 
   * Question about the service being optional - for those in the ITB testing, we need a critical mass of testing sites.  Jeff will contact site admins directly and cc' osg-int so that others can see what the technical issues. 
   * Will work on job submission via condor-g to ws-gram gatekeepers.


---++ Reports from Sites on ITB 0.5.2 (ITB site admins)

---++ Other ITB 0.5.2 issues
   * Last week' issues:
      * Steve Timm requested working voms-proxy-xxx clients on 64 bit platforms. Tim believes the 32 bit code should work on 64 bit machines. This needs to be tested.
      * Steve has requested that a syntax problem exists related to GUMS:
         * The dash "-" should be supported in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names.
         * The dot "." should be supported in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names.
         * ACTION ITEM:  Ransome and Oscar need to be contacted to work this issue.
   * WN-Client issue


---++ Documentation (Rob Q, Alain)
   * RWG note: we need to assess the work required to bring the current ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.DocumentationTable into production readiness.  In OSG is is done as part of the *Provisioning* process, which Rob Q and Alain will be leading. 
   * Last week:
      * Jeff will due a fast first pass through the OSG 0.5.2 install guide and initial and date each section that needs attention. Then we will put together a team to revise this document as a top priority. Steve T and John W discussed the priority of needing to run configure_osg.sh prior to running vdt-control during initial configuration and that this fact is not documented yet.
   * What are the opinions of the 0.5 documentation? Steve notes a couple of holes that he needs to look into next week.
   * Assignment of editors for each section.
   * First round of edits due next week.

---++ RT Roundup
   * Did not have time to check these.
