---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: David, Jeff, Rob Q, Stu, Martin Feller, Suchandra
   * Apologies: Rob G.
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, April 17, 2007; 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MinutesApr10

---++ WS Gram testing by Martin:
   * misconfigurations of hostname/IP-adress mapping on osg-test1.unl.edu (osg-test1 returned the IP of a NIC with a private  IP-adress) and problematic DN-2-username mappings on t2dev.uchicago.edu. After we solved that, 200 job submissions from t2dev-osg.uchicago.edu to t2dev-osg.uchicago.edu run without problems for me.
   * In a larger submission (500 jobs), 50 out of 500 jobs from t2dev.uchicago.edu to t2dev.uchicago.edu caused authorization problems, problably located in GUMS  or PRIMA, but not in WS-GRAM.
   * I can submit 200, 300 and 500 jobs from t2dev-osg.uchicago.edu to osg-test1.unl.edu without problems, i didn't try larger ones so far.
   * I can submit 200 jobs from osg-test2.unl.edu to osg-itb.ligo.caltech.edu.   (didn't try more so far, but will start a larger submission this evening)
   * Currently i assume it's not the container itself that causes problems, but configuration/firewall/port-setting issues.
   * Number of Threads used by the Container may be a critical resource. We are reconfiguring the container to use 100 Threads instead of the default 20 Threads as a next step. 
   * Martin will explore futher if the ws-gram causes the Container to hang when > 100 jobs per interval are submitted.

---++ WS Gram Problems characterized by Jeff:
   * firewall settings
   * systems/resources
   * condor-g config-params
   * condor-g versus globusrun-ws comparison
   * gt2 vs gt4 results as a baseline to help identify causes for service degradation.

---++ WS Gram testing by David:
   * latest Condor-G test results on OSG-ITB : https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/WsGramOsgSites
   * Problems occured trying to submit to TTU_ANTAEUS (hardware problems) and UWMilwaukee (ws-gram misconfigured on initial installation - Is this a VDT installation issue?)
   * Planning scalability tests after problem with stability of ws-gram is resolved.

---++ WS Gram test plan by Suchandra:
   * More testing is planned including a Condor-G test that transfers 100 MB of files during each test.

---++ Possible testing of WS Gram with additional workflow methods:
   * Stu would be interested in testing the Swiftscript workflow description language with WS Gram.
   * Suchandra mentioned that he discovered a problem setting up Swift which he will document further.  He hasn't had time to follow up on that problem but will in the future.
   * Suchandra has Swift engineering resources locally available at UC and will discuss with them if they can contribute to testing Swiftscript on the OSG.
