---+OSG Client Installation Instructions

---++Introduction


<p>The OSG Release uses the <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.10/release.html">VDT</a>
for the client installation.</p>


<p>
You need <strong>not</strong> install the client package as
<code>root</code>. Use the following commands to create a
installation directory and perform the installation.
</p>

---++Install Pacman

See the pacman guide located [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/PacmanInfo][here]].

<b>NOTE: Pacman version 3.16.2 was used for testing of all components of version 0.3.6.</b>


---++Install the client packages

<p>
 To begin the installation, create an installation directory for the OSG Client.</p>

<pre> $ mkdir ~/client_directory 
 $ cd ~/client_dirctory
 $ pacman -get iVDGL:client</pre>

<p> During the installation you will be prompted to answer a few configuration questions. Common answers are provided below. </p>

<pre>Do you want to add [http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n):</pre>

Note: you will be asked this question multiple times for different pacman cache locations, answer<code>&#160;y&#160;</code>each time.


<p> Depending upon your operating system, you may be prompted by the
 question:</p>

<pre>  The VDT is unable to recognize your platform. This version of 
  the VDT is supported on several Linux releases:

   RedHat 7
   RedHat 9
   RedHat Enterprise Linux 3
   Fedora Core 3
   Debian 3.1
   ROCKS 3.3
   Fermi Scientific Linux 3.0
 
  The VDT may work on other platforms, but it's not guaranteed. If you
  encounter problems and send mail to the VDT team for support please
  mention that you are installing the VDT on an unsupported platform.

  Do you wish to continue? [y/n] </pre>

<p>Answer<code>&#160;y&#160;</code>to continue the installation.</p>

<p>After the installation has completed, you will also be able to

<pre>VDT 1.3.10 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.3.10

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] </pre>

<p>Answer<code>&#160;y&#160;</code>to continue.</p>

<pre>The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
</pre>

<p> Press<code>&#160;l&#160;</code>(the letter l) to select the location for the certificates.
</p> 

<p>The client will complete with the following output:</p>

<pre>The VDT version 1.3.10 has been installed.</pre>

You can 
<pre>
source setup.csh
or 
. setup.sh
</pre>
to get all the client tools into your $PATH.

---++Do you have a user certificate?

<p>
You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests. If
you don't have a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a
grid proxy (<code>grid-proxy-init</code>, etc.), contact your <a href="http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php">VO
Support Center.</a>
</p>
---++Post-install README
<p>
If you want to submit jobs using the Personal Condor that comes
as part of the client tool, read the $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README
for information on how to start it up.  Pay specific attention 
to the "condor" script in that directory which can be used to 
start up condor at boot time.  Also note the edg-crl-upgraded 
startup script.  Without the edg-crl-upgraded script the 
Certificate Authority Certificate Revocation List files that 
are downloaded with the client will eventually expire and you 
will not be able to do any interactive globus-url-copycommands.
