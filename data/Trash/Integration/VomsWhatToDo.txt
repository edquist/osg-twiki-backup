---+!!<nop>How to Install VOMS
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%
---++Introduction
The [[http://hep-project-grid-scg.web.cern.ch/hep-project-grid-scg/voms.html VOMS]] (Virtual Organization Membership Service) has three main parts: 
<OL>
<LI>A !MySql database which is a persistent repository for VO membership information, 
<LI>The VOMS Admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VO membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat-4.
<LI>The VOMS server, a daemon process which services the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests.
</OL>

Also  included in the installation is a VOMS client containing the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> for testing.

Here we describe how to install and configure VOMS on your Linux machine. When you install VOMS as described here, you get all three parts.  It comes with a test VO called VDT. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VO with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.

We also describe how to remove a VO from VOMS, and how to uninstall VOMS, should the need arise.

All the sample commands are shown with Bourne shell syntax.  Substitute appropriate values as needed.

---++Pre-requisites for VOMS  Installation

---+++Pacman
You will use pacman to install VOMS.  See the 
<a href="http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/PacmanInfo">Pacman guide</a>
 for download and installation instructions.

---+++Certificates
If you do not already have the necessary certificates on this host, this can  be done as a post-install step. Instructions for getting the certificate can be found at this 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/requesting_cert.html">VDT site</A>. 
		  Also refer to any instructions you may find in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/post-install/README that may be related to this.

<OL>
<LI><b>host certificate</b>: Used by the VOMS server.  The host certificate should be installed in /etc/grid-security with ownership and permissions as:
<pre>
/etc/grid-security
-rw-r--r--  1 root	root	 1176 Nov  7 16:38 hostcert.pem
-r--------  1 root	root	  887 Nov  7 16:38 hostkey.pem
</pre> 

<p>
<LI><b>http certificate</b>: Used by apache.  The http certificate for your system should be installed in  /etc/grid-security/http with ownership and permission as:
<pre>
/etc/grid-security
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1176 Nov  7 16:38 httpcert.pem
-r--------  1 root root  887 Nov  7 16:38 httpkey.pem
</pre>
 If you do not already have one on this machine, this will have to be done as a post-install step. Instructions for getting the certificate can be found at this 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/requesting_cert.html">VDT site</A>. 
		  Also refer to any instructions you may find in the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/post-install/README that may be related to this.
<p>
</OL>

---+++Known Problems
Review the "Known Problems" section of the ItbRel015 or ItbRel016 page depending on the version being installed.

---+++Previous installations
If you have an OSG VOMS running and you're about to reinstall or if any of the following daemons are installed and running on your machine, see the [[#ShutdownGuide][Shutdown instructions]] below. 


	 
---++What's  Getting Installed

---+++Software
These instructions are for  ITB 0.3.6 (VDT 1.3.10) release of VOMS which installs this software
<pre>
	 Apache HTTPD 2.2.0
	 CA Certificates v11 (includes IGTF 1.0 CAs)
	 EDG CRL Update 1.2.5
	 GPT 3.2
	 Java SDK 1.4.2_10
	 Logrotate 3.7
	 MySQL 4.1.11
	 Apache Tomcat 5.0.28
	 VOMS 1.6.10.2
	 VOMS Admin (client 1.2.10, interface 1.0.2, server 1.2.10) 1.2.10-r0
</pre>

---+++Services - /etc/init.d
The services installed and activated are:
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  1684 Feb 21 23:02 edg-crl-upgraded
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  6591 Feb 21 23:02 mysql
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  4039 Feb 21 23:03 apache 
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  3289 Feb 21 23:03 tomcat-5
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  8890 Feb 22 09:24 voms
</pre>

In addition, during the installation, a test VO called 'VDT' will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the 'VDT' VO will have to be performed separately.

Note: The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> client in previous releases of VDT (1.3.2 and below) may be incompatible with this release.	If this is of concern to you, you will have to run both an older and a newer VOMS to retain compatibility with the older versions of <i>edg-mkgridmap</i>..

VDT 1.3.10 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

	  http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.3.10

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n]  <b><i>y</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------
	 :
The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?
Choices:
		  r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
				(existing CA files will be preserved)
		  l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
		  n (no)	 - do not install
<b><i>r</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------	

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.
Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?
Possible Answers:
	  y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
		  this one..
	  n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
		  run this one.
	  s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
		  there is already an instance running, leave it alone.
<b><i>y</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------

If you would like, we can configure VOMS to start automatically at boot time.

Configuring the VOMS daemon requires
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMS server to run automatically?

Possible Answers:
	  y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
		  this one..
	  n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
		  run this one.
	  s: Skip. Don't run the service from this installation, and if
		  there is already an instance running, leave it alone.
 
	<b><i>y</b></i>
	:	-----------------------------------------------------

Do you want the EDG CRL update daemon to be run automatically when
your computer starts up? If so, we will install one file,
edg-crl-updated, into etc/rc.d/init.d/.

It will periodically update the Europen DataGrid (EDG) certificate
revocation lists (CRLs) It is essential if you are collaborating with
people from the EDG, and not important if you are not.

</pre>
The above line should be the last line of output you see.  The version number of the tarball may be different 
than that shown above.  Do not be concerned with this.

---+++Verify the  installation completed successfully
To verify  the pacman installation was successful, there should be a setup.(c)sh in the VDT_LOCATION.	If present, source it.
<pre>
&gt  cd $VDT_LOCATION
&gt  source setup.sh
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> This does not necessarily indicated that everything was installed and configured successfully.  It just verifies that the pacman installation completed successfully.  There is a lot of other magic that occurs during the process that should be validated.



---++Verifying the Success of the Installation
If all the required certificates were in place prior to the pacman installation, a default VO called <i>VDT</i> has been created already and all the deamon services should be up and running.
This section will take you through the steps necessary to verify that and can also serve as a basic operational trouble shooting guide.

If the certificates were installed <b>after</b> the pacman installation, then you should go to the next section (<a href="#Creating_a_new_VO">Creating a new VO</a>)  and create a <i>VDT</i> VO for test/play purposes.  Then return here to varify the configuration.

For  all the verifications, you will need to source the VDT setup.(c)sh script:
<pre>
&gt  cd &lt VDT_LOCATION &gt
&gt  source setup.sh
</pre>

---+++Verifying  the edg-crl-upgrade daemon
The edg-crl-upgrade daemon  (essential if you are collaborating with EDG people) updates the certificate revocation lists on a daily (default) basis.
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  1684 Feb 21 23:02 edg-crl-upgraded
</pre>
To verify it is running:
<pre>
&gt	ps -efwww |  grep edg-crl-upgrade
root  13268  1  0 Feb21 ?	00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/local/osg/edg/sbin/edg-crl-upgrade
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  Verify that it is the only one running and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION.


To verify it created the crl files:
<pre>
&gt	ls -l  $X509_CADIR/*.r0
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  61312 Feb 22 10:48 /usr/local/osg/globus/TRUSTED_CA/01621954.r0
-rw-r--r--  1 root root	7657 Feb 22 10:48 /usr/local/osg/globus/TRUSTED_CA/03aa0ecb.r0
-rw-r--r--  1 root root	1868 Feb 22 10:48 /usr/local/osg/globus/TRUSTED_CA/1149214e.r0
		 :	
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> The number of crl files does not directly correlate to the number of CAs, 
			 but there should be at least 1 and they should never be more than a day old
			  unless you've change the default interval.



---+++Verifying  the apache/tomcat daemon
Apache and Tomcat are used to access the WEB user interface of  VOMS. 
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 4039 Feb 21 23:03 apache
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 3289 Feb 21 23:03 tomcat-5
</pre>
To verify <b>apache</b> is running:
<pre>
&gt	ps -efwww |  grep  apache
<b>apache</b>	 2585 10881  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:00 /usr/sbin/httpd
<b> (there will be a number of these)</b>
			 :
root		8924	  1  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:03 /usr/local/osg/<b>apache</b>/bin/httpd -d /usr/local/osg/<a>apache</b> 
			-k start -f  /usr/local/osg/<b>apache</b>/conf/httpd.conf
daemon	15165  8924  0 09:24 ?		  00:00:00 /usr/local/osg/<b>apache</b>/bin/httpd 
<b>(and a number of these)</b>
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  Verify that it is the only one running and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION.  
In the case of apache, there should be several <i>/usr/bin/httpd</i> processes owned by apache running in
addition to the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/apache/bin/httpd</i> processes.

To verify <b>tomcat</b> is running:
<pre>
	&gt	ps -efwww |  grep tomcat
	daemon	15238	  1  0 09:24 pts/2	 00:00:15 /usr/local/osg/jdk1.4/bin/java	  
	-Djava.endorsed.dirs=/usr/local/osg/<b>tomcat</b>/v5/common/endorsed
	-classpath	 /usr/local/osg/jdk1.4/lib/tools.jar:/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5/bin/bootstrap.jar:/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5/bin/commons-logging-api.jar 
	-Dcatalina.base=/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5 -Dcatalina.home=/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5		
	-Djava.io.tmpdir=/usr/local/osg/tomcat/v5/temp org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  
<UL>
<LI>There should be only one tomcat process running with <i>init (pid=1)</i> as it's parent.
<LI>Verify that it is the only one running and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION.
</UL>

---+++Verifying  the mysql daemon
!MySql  is used to provide persistent storage of the VOMS VO membership data.
<pre>
	<b>/etc/init.d</b>
	-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 6591 Feb 21 23:02 mysql
</pre>
To verify it is running:
<pre>
&gt	ps -efwww |  grep  mysql  
root		6606	  1  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:00 /bin/sh /usr/local/osg/mysql/real-bin/mysqld_safe 
--defaults-file=/usr/local/osg/mysql/var/my.cnf --datadir=/usr/local/osg/vdt-app-data/mysql/var 
--pid-file=/usr/local/osg/vdt-app-data/mysql/var/cmssrv08.fnal.gov.pid
<b>(The parent mysql process is the only one displayed here)</b>
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>  Verify that it is the only one running and the path contains your VDT_LOCATION.

---+++Verifying the VOMS WEB UI
If all the certificates were in place prior to the pacman installation, a default VO called <i>VDT</i> was configured.
To verify it is accessible:
<OL>
<LI>Point a certificate-enabled browser window to				 
		  <i>https://<b>your.host.name</b>:8443/edg-voms-admin/VDT</i>
  <UL><LI>You should be prompted for your certificates passphrase
				<LI>You should get a <i>Welcome to the VDT VO</i> page
	</UL>
<LI>In  the left hand menu under <i>FOR VO USERS</i>, select <i>My membership details</i>.<br>
			The membership details page should say <i>You are not currently a member of this VO</i>, which you  are not yet.
<LI>Do a <i>Back</i>  in your browser.
<LI.>Now select <i>Administer the VO </i>  under the <i>FOR VO MANAGERS</i>  item on the left menu..<br>
			 Then slect <i>Create a New VO User</i> from the new menu.  You should get <i>Access denied</i>.
<LI>Do a <i>Back</i> in your browser, twice, to return to the main page again.
<LI>Select <i>Configuration information</i> under the <i>Configuration</i> menu item.  The 3 items 
		  displayed provide the syntax and data content used for the various authorization modes available on the grid  for your VO.  
</OL>
At this point, you know your VOMS WEB UI is functional.

---+++Verifying the VOMS server daemon
The VOMS server's only purpose is to service <i>voms-proxy-init</i> requests for your VO.
<pre>
<b>/etc/init.d</b>
--rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 8890 Feb 22 09:24 voms
</pre>
To verify <b>voms</b> is running:
<pre>
&gt	ps -efwww | grep edg-voms
daemon	13033	  1  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:00 /usr/local/osg/voms/sbin/edg-voms  --conf	/usr/local/osg/voms/etc/voms/<b>VDT</b>/voms.conf
daemon	15396	  1  0 Feb21 ?		  00:00:00 /usr/local/osg/voms/sbin/edg-voms --conf /usr/local/osg/voms/etc/voms/<b>VDT</b>/voms.conf
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> 
<UL>
<LI>There are individual <i>VOMS servers</i> for each VO, each using a unique port
			to service requests.
<LI>There are usually 2 <i>edg-voms</i> processes that are running for each VO.
		  There are times when only 1 is running and the server works fine.  
			This is one of those mysteries in life that one just accepts.
<LI>Verify that  the path contains your <i>VDT_LOCATION</i>.
</UL>

---+++Verifying the VOMS version
The voms-admin and voms server versions can be verified using the following command:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo VDT  -version
voms-admin v1.2.10-1
server side is v1.2.10
</pre>
If the versions do not display, then there is a problem with either the web interface or the VOMS server.

---++Securing your server
All access to VOMS is through apache and tomcat, even the command line <i>voms-admin</i> command.  To secure your server and require only authenticated access, run the following command.
<pre>
 &gt  $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_apache --secure
 &gt  /etc/init.d/apache restart
</pre>

---++Configuring VOMS - the configure_voms script
---+++Creating a VO

Additional functions performed by the <i>configure_voms</i> script are:
<OL>
<LI>
A Global-ACL is created for the host certificate for this server with <i>allow all</i> 
capabilities.  This allows the <i>root</i> user on this machine to update the VOMS VO using the command line interface
command <i>voms-admin</i>.  So, in effect, the <i>root</i> user is already a VO-Admin  in this VO.
<p>
This <i>root</i> user capability can be removed <b>after</b> an individual  is assigned the VO-Admin role as described in the next section.
<p>
<LI>
A second Global-ACL is created with <i>allow list</i> capabilities for anyone that presents a 
certificate issued by a known VO.  The purpose for this is two-fold:
<p>
  <UL>
		<LI>Those sites using <a href="http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/GumsAdmins">GUMS servers</a> will be able to access your VO without the VO-Admin having to individually provide this Global-ACL capability on a case by case basis.	This is the default configuration and can be changed.
<p>
		<LI>It allows VO members or (those that think they are VO members) to query the VOMS to troubleshoot problems in getting voms proxies and verify their membership in various groups and role asssignments. 
  </UL>
</OL>

---++++Creation of the default VDT VO 
As you have already seen, a VO called <i>VDT</i> has already been created during the initial
installation process.  This was done be executing:
<pre>
	$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_voms  --server y  --vo <b>VDT</b> 
</pre>
Many default values were applied during this process.  The values applied can  be viewed in the 
<i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log</i> and searching for  
'loaded by vdt/setup/configure_voms'.



---++++Creating a new VO

---+++Removing a VO from VOMS

---++Enabling a VOMS VO
Several things have to be done to actually enable your VO to begin accepting membership, used for voms proxy generation, and used for the Compatiblity and Full  Privilege 
<a href="http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/viewauth/Integration/OsgCEAuthorization">authorization modes</a> on compute (CE) and storage (SE) element  nodes.

The following sub-sections will reference the default <i>VDT</i> in the text and examples.  When enabling your 
'real' VO, the same steps are required and, where different, it will be noted.


---+++Establishing a VO-Admin
A person (or persons) can be designated as the VO-Admin for the VOMS VO created.  This person(s) has 
adminstrative capabilty within VOMS that the normal VO member will not have.  

There are 2 options for adding this capability to an individual:
<OL>
  <LI>The individual <u>is not</u> a member of the VO.	A Global-ACL for that individual with <i>allow all</i> capability allows a person to administer the VO's VOMS from the command line and WEB UI.<p>
		  <UL>
		  <LI>Individual's certificate file is available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> add-acl-entry Global-ACL allow all <b>usercert.pem</b>
</pre>
			 <LI>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b>  -nousercert  add-acl-entry  Global-ACL allow all "<b>USER DN</b>" "<b>USER CA</b>"
</pre>
			  </UL>

  <LI>The individual <u>is</u> a member of the VO.  This can be accomplished by giving the individual the Global-ACL
			  capablility above or by first adding them to the VO as a member (described in the next section) and then assigning them the <i>VO-Admin</i> role with the following command:<p>
		  <UL>
		  <LI>Individual's certificate file is available:	  
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> assign-role  <b>GROUP</b> VO-Admin <b>usercert.pem</b>
</pre>
			 <LI>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> assign-role  <b>GROUP</b> VO-Admin  "<b>USER DN</b>" "<b>USER CA</b>"
</pre>
			  </UL>		
</OL>

---+++Adding  a user to the VO
Individuals with the <i>VO-Admin</i> role or the  <i>allow all</i> Global-ACL are referred to as VO Managers in VOMS and are the only ones who can add new members via the web ui.
In normal practice, users will request VO membership by accessing the <i>New user registration</i> menu item on the main VOMS web page.  This document will not go into the details of that process here, nor will it address the basic usage and navigation of the VOMS web ui.

The purpose of this section is to show you how to add a user for the purposes of assigning the <i>VO-Admin</i> role as a part of the initial setup.	

Four data items are required for each user:
<UL><LI>DN
			 <LI>CA
			  <LI>Common Name (CN part of the DN or just 1st and last name so you can be easily identified)
			  <LI>email address 
</UL>

If you have the user's certificate file available, then these 4 items are derived from that.
		  <UL>
		  <LI>Individual's certificate file is available:	  
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> add-member  <b>GROUP</b>  <b>usercert.pem</b>
</pre>
			 <LI>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre>
&gt  voms-admin -vo <b>VO</b> add-member  <b>GROUP</b>	"<b>USER DN</b>" "<b>USER CA</b>"  "<b>USER CN</b>" <b>USER EMAIL</b>"
</pre>
			  </UL>		

If you have added the user for the purpose of assigning the <i>VO-Admin</i> role, you will want to re-visit the
<a href="VomsWhatToDo#Establishing_a_VO_Admin">Establishing a VO-Admin</a> section above to assing the role.




---+++Verifying you are a VO-Admin
If you've established yourself with the <i>VO-Admin</i> role or with the <i>allow all</i> Global-ACL, you can now go back the VOMS web ui in a browser with your certificate and from the main menu:
<UL><LI>Under <i>For VO Managers</i>, select <i>Administer the VO</i>
			 <LI>Then, select <i>Global ACL</i>
</UL>
You should no longer see the <i>Access Denied</i> error and should be able to see the Global-ACL's  tthat have been created.	As a <i>VO-Admin</i>, you can do anything you want.  

<b>Note:</b>  A user with the <i>VO-Admin</i> role only has these privileges in the VOMS web ui.  The command line <i>voms-admin</i>  does not authorize using the VOMS roles.  It allow <i>voms-admin</i> command line capability, you must establish a Global-ACL with the capability you desire.  By default, only the <i>root</i> user has this on inittial installation.


---++Testing access to your VO's VOMS server
There are several functions on the grid that access your VOMS VO:
<OL><LI>voms proxy generation (<i>voms-proxy-init</i>)
			 <LI>grid-mapfile generation on the CE nodes
					<UL><LI><i>edg-mkgridmap</i> for Grid3 authorization mode</UL>
			  <LI>GUMS  interface  for Compatibility and Full Privilege authorization modes.
</OL>

---+++ Testing voms-proxy-init
The <i>voms-proxy-init</i> client command was included in the installation. The client <i>voms-proxy-init</i> uses a configuration file that contains the necessary arguments to access a VO's VOMS server.  On the VOMS server node, this file is  located in the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/voms/etc/vomses</i> directory and looks like this for the <i>VDT</i> VO:
<pre>
"VDT" "cmssrv08.fnal.gov" "15000" "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cmssrv08.fnal.gov" "VDT" "32"
</pre>
Tokens:
<OL>
<LI>Considered a "nickname"  and , although the default is the VO name, it can be any value you desire to identify the VO you wish  to get a proxy from..  
<LI>The hostname of the voms server
<LI>Port number the server is listening on.
<LI>DN of the server's VOMS certificate
<LI>VO name
<LI>Globus version supported
</OL>
<P>
The <i>vomses</i> file syntax/values for each VO you create, can be viewed on the web ui for your VO by selecting <i>Configuration information</i> on the left hand menu of the main page.
<p>
On the server, there is no need to create a <i>$HOME/.glite/vomses</i> file containing the VOMS servers you wish to access.  The <i>voms-proxy-init</i> command will search the <i>vomses</i> directory  on this server for this file. 

So to test the <i>voms-proxy-init</i> command, you need to do the following:

1. If you have not already added yourself as a member of the VO,  do so now.

2. Then, as yourself (not <i>root</i> user),
<pre>
&gt  source VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt  voms-proxy-init --voms=VDT:/VDT
<b>...output follows.. </b>
Cannot find file or dir: /home/weigand/.glite/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase:
<b><i>... your passphrase...</b></i>
Your proxy is valid until Sat Feb 25 00:17:33 2006

Creating temporary proxy ............................. Done
Contacting  cmssrv08.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cmssrv08.fnal.gov] "VDT"

Warning: Cannot find file or dir: /home/weigand/.glite/vomses Done
Creating proxy .................................................... Done
Your proxy is valid until Sat Feb 25 00:17:33 2006
</pre>

A couple of things about the output shown above that you might want to be aware of::
<UL>
<LI>The warnings about not finding a <i>$HOME/.glite/vomses</i> are not a problem, since on the server it is using the <i>./vomses</i> directory mentioned earlier.
<LI>The temporary proxy it generates is the good old grid proxy.  This is used for the access to VOMS and just temporary.
</UL>

3. To verify the output of the voms proxy has the extended attributes the VOMS service provides. The extended attribute and location of the proxy file are highlighted in the output:
<pre>
&gt  voms-proxy-info --all
<b>... output follows....</b>
WARNING: Unable to verify signature!
Error: Cannot find certificate of AC issuer for vo VDT
subject	: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491/CN=proxy
issuer	 : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
identity  : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
type		: proxy
strength  : 512 bits
path		: <b>/tmp/x509up_u500</b>
timeleft  : 11:51:40
=== VO VDT extension information ===
VO		  : VDT

<b>attribute : /VDT/Role=NULL/Capability=NULL</b>
timeleft  : 11:51:40
</pre>

4. Now try one for a group you do not belong to, e.g., /MyGroup
<pre>
&gt  voms-proxy-init --voms=VDT:/MyGroup
<b>...output follows.. </b>
Cannot find file or dir: /home/weigand/.glite/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase:
Your proxy is valid until Sat Feb 25 00:32:18 2006

Creating temporary proxy .................................. Done
Contacting  cmssrv08.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cmssrv08.fnal.gov] "VDT"
<b>Error: VDT: Unable to satisfy G/MyGroup Request!</b>
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> If a subsequent attempt at a voms proxy fails, as ours did here, the previously generated proxy is still in effect.  You can do another <i>voms-proxy-init --all</i> to verify this.



---+++ Testing edg-mkgridmap
The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> is run on a site's Compute Element (CE) node to generated a <i>grid-mapfile</i> file.  This script is not provided as a part of the VOMS installation, so you will have to go a CE node to test this.  You do not have to be the <i>root</i> user on the CE node, but you will need to have a personal certificate available.
<p>
The <i>mkgridmap</i> file syntax/values for each VO you create, can be viewed on the web ui for your VO by selecting <i>Configuration information</i> on the left hand menu of the main page.
<pre>
group vomss://cmssrv08.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  .VDT
</pre>
<b>Note:</b> This is an EDG format for the account name.	You will likely want to change it to the group account you want assigned for your CE node.  The example above is for a <i>group</i> account assignment.
<p>
To test on a CE node.
<UL><LI>In some writable area, create a <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file and populate it with the example configuration file on your VOMS server.  It will be the only entry.
<pre>
&gt  echo 'group vomss://cmssrv08.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  .VDT' >./edg-mkgridmap.conf
</pre>
			 <LI>Execute the edg-mkgridmap allowing the output to go to stdout:
<pre>
&gt  edg-mkgridmap --conf ./edg-mkgridmap.conf 
Enter PEM pass phrase: 
<b>... output follows ...</b>
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491" .VDT
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cmssrv08.fnal.gov"  .VDT
</pre>
</UL>

---+++ Testing the GUMS interface
The GUMS authorization server periodically 'pulls' the VO membership data for it's authorization and account assignment  functions from the various VO's VOMS servers.  

Unfortunately, there is now way of testing this except for an installed GUMS server.


---++Creating a new VO
You won't be able to use the default VO named VDT (the VO name must be unique). You'll have to create a new one (or any number of new ones).
---+++What to expect and what you need to know
When you create a new VO, many things occur. In particular, a database and several files are created, and you need to know what they're used for. CreateNewVoForVomsInfo lists and describes these things.
---+++Before creating the VO
Define the following series of environment variables representing the arguments used on the install command line.  Note: the syntax used for defining this data is in Bourne shell format.  Depending on whether you need to change the value, you may be able to just cut/paste a lot of these
		commands during the installation process.  
		
	 VO=Test	<br />	  
		The name of your VO (shown as Test).  Mixed case is permissable. 
		This will also be the top level (root) group for the VO.

	 PORT=15007	 <br />
		Port number the voms server listens on for voms-proxy-init requests.
		Each VO has a unique instance of the voms server running and listening on a port.

	 SMTP_HOST=smtp.fnal.gov	<br />
		The hostname of the SMTP delivery service at the site of this VOMS server.
		The host must accept emails for delivery.

	 MAIL_FROM=your-email-address <br />
		The sender email address for the notification messages sent by this VOMS service.
		This should be a read address otherwise the failure notifications will end up in 
		/dev/null.

	 PASSWORD=some-unique-password  <br />
		The password of this VO's voms database users mentioned above ($VO_adm, $VO_que, $VO_seq and $VO_upd).
		Please change ffomr what is shown above!

	 VOMS_GROUP=daemon <br />
		The Unix group name of the user the VOMS server runs under. 
		The default with VDT installations is 'daemon'.  

	 TOMCAT_GROUP=daemon <br />
		The Unix group name of the user that tomcat4 runs under. 
		The default with VDT installations is 'daemon'.  

	 CERTDIR=$GLOBUS_PATH/TRUSTED_CA <br />
		Not sure if this has any affect as it does not appear to be picking up
		all the CAs in this directory.  Actually, this is a link and this may
		be the problem.%RED%John -- what was the problem? AH 6/2%ENDCOLOR%



---++Add users, groups, and roles to your VOMS installation

Go to your VOMS web UI, click Adminstrate VOMS.  Use the Users, Groups and Roles links to add these items.

---++Shutdown Guide
#ShutdownGuide
The OSG VOMS starts up several processes.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG VOMS without shutting them down it will fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG VOMS services before upgrading:

<ul>
  <li>/etc/ini.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/apache stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/tomcat-5  stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/voms stop
  <li>/etc/init.d/mysql stop
</ul>
