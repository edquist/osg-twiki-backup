---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: John R, Jeff, Rob, Suchandra, Brian
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MinutesVTBJun5
   * Background
      * WSGramValidation, and WsGramOsgSites
      * SysLogNg

---++ VTB install issues
   * Looking at GIP validator results at http://gip-validate.grid.iu.edu/.  There may be a problem with the configure GIP script - Suchandra will contact the GROW group.
   * This is only known (non-SGE) issue to date. Jeff has been looking at the SGE install. WS gram does not work for the SGE job manager - may need to send this to vdt-support.  

---++ WS gram testing
   * Quick summary - restarted Globus container, ramped up to 800 jobs at which point there are problems -jobs going into a held state.
   * Will try these tests again using edge5.

---++ syslog-ng forwarding (Brian)
   * See http://www.cedps.net/wiki/index.php/Php-syslog-ng and http://netlogger.lbl.gov/phpsyslogng/.  
   * Question as to which hosts are forwarding - there may be a problem with the syslog-ng configuration on the LBL VTB host.
   * Discussed how the template facility from syslog-ng which is used to write mysql statements.  Question about the pre-defined fields - whether these are being filled correctly, etc.
   * Privacy issues - how to rollout beyond VTB.    For encryption, we can use stunnel - perhaps make this an option, not the default, for site admins.  
      * DNs: probably easy to identify and obscure.
      * Local unix accounts - more difficult to recognize.
      * We need to discuss this further with the security working group.

---++ AOB
   * None.
