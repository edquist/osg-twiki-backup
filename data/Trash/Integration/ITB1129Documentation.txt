---+++ Updating
After upgrading you may have both old and new RSV probes running.
After turning on all your services using vdt-control run
'condor_cron_q'.  If you see any processes that say "probe_wrapper.pl"
(as opposed to rsv-control) then:

   * =vdt-control --off osg-rsv= # turn off new metrics
   * condor_cron_rm -all
   * condor_cron_q # verify that all the processes have been removed
   * vdt-control --on osg-rsv # turn new metrics back on
   * vdt-control --off osg-rsv # turn off new metrics
   * condor_cron_rm -all # clean out old metrics
   * condor_cron_q # verify that all the processes have been removed
   * vdt-control --on osg-rsv # turn new metrics back on

  In addition, please try the following specific tests related to software components that we've updated:

   * If you are updating from ITB 1.1.26 or later, let us know how the new update process works.
   * In addition to making sure the probes are working correctly, please try using the new rsv features found in rsv-control
   * Verify that information reporting to bdii is working and the correct information is being reported.  Also:
      * Verify WLCG site attributes are being reported correctly
      * Verify allowed_vos work corrrectly for SEs
   * Bestman and friends have already been tested by the VDT storage team.  Feel free to update and test if desired but we do not require any more testing before the release. 

---+++ Open bugs and workarounds

---+++ How to report a bug?
Bug reports for the installation and documentation should be filed with GOC at [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/itb/open]].  *Please don't use the VDT support center or any other support center as the recipient since that will cause a email loop*
