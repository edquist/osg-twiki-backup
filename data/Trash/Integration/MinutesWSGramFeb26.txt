   * how to organize ourselves, who-should-be-at-this-meeting, engagement with and requirements from app developers/communities, and various OSG contact points.
   * lets summarize Jeff's current results in https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/TestingGram4 and look over historical efforts: http://t2.unl.edu/cms/ws-osg-tests/, http://home.fnal.gov/~weigand/globus-ws/notes.shtml
   * Globus in-house testing and CDIGS program of work, and other efforts we know about
   * at the OSG consortium meeting... 
      * results for "effectiveness" session (I have a talk on ITB/VTB - I'd like to include a  "state of the service" summary for WS Gram)
      * tutorial contribution?  "Getting starting with WS-Gram" <-- setting up WS-Gram capable submit host

---++ Notes from meeting
   * We need to make sure that WS Gram is turned on a well on the sites that do deploy it.
   * Accounting - are we integrated with Gratia?  Stu has discussed auditing features with Gram, how those records could be used by Gratia.  Results in a log4j.  Container logfile exisists, similar to the old gatekeeper logfile.  Alain confirms this the case.
   * Container issues - VDT 1.6.1 by default uses the Globus container.
   * Advertising the endponts.  Whats the solution for the near term?  Find a plug-in point, write out an ldfiff file, collect up.
      * step 1: static list (Jeff's list)
      * step 2: integrate with bdii
      * step 3: ws index server - as a prototype, easy to do.  webmds, eg.
   * Issues with providing access - start first with the OSG VO, perhaps later come in as a separate VO. 
      * NCSA CA is supported, see: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/certificate_authorities.html

---++ Jeff's update
   * Still stuck on his Condor-G problem fixed.  Need more examples for Condor-G.
   * Stu will provide Jeff with some performance testing examples.
   * Six or 7 sites have installed and are working.
   * Will build up a set of job types.
   * Can we put together a tutorial on the time scale of next week?

---++ User testing
   * Stu will point users to the ITB sites.  Jeff will provide endpoints.
