---++ Introduction
   * Attending: Stu, Suchandra, Rob, Jeff
   * Coordinates: Monday Feb 26, 2007; 2pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212

---++ Agenda
   * how to organize ourselves, who-should-be-at-this-meeting, engagement with and requirements from app developers/communities, and various OSG contact points.
   * lets summarize Jeff's current results in https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/TestingGram4 and look over historical efforts: http://t2.unl.edu/cms/ws-osg-tests/, http://home.fnal.gov/~weigand/globus-ws/notes.shtml
   * Globus in-house testing and CDIGS program of work, and other efforts we know about
   * at the OSG consortium meeting... 
      * results for "effectiveness" session (I have a talk on ITB/VTB - I'd like to include a  "state of the service" summary for WS Gram)
      * tutorial contribution?  "Getting starting with WS-Gram" <-- setting up WS-Gram capable submit host

---++ Notes from meeting
   * We need to make sure that WS Gram is functional on a well-defined set of  sites in OSG 0.6.  This shouldn't be a problem, and we have number of sites with functional WS Gram gatekeepers right now in the ITB. %Y%
   * Accounting - are we integrated with Gratia?  *Yes*.  Stu has discussed auditing features with Gram, how those records could be used by Gratia.  Results in a log4j.  Container logfile exisists, similar to the old gatekeeper logfile.  Alain confirms this the case. %Y%
   * Container issues - VDT 1.6.1 by default uses the Globus container.  Documented.  %Y%
   * Advertising the endponts.  Whats the solution for the near term?  Stu thinks we can easily find a plug-in point, write out an ldfiff file, collect up. 
      * step 1: static list (Jeff's list) %Y%
      * step 2: integrate with bdii - *work to do for next OSG release; by whom?*
      * step 3: ws index server - as a prototype, easy to do.  webmds, eg.  - *potential work for the next OSG release; or provide outside OSG?*
   * Issues with providing access to new OSG VOs that have *already migrated* to WS Gram - start first with the OSG VO, perhaps later come in as a separate VO. 
      * NCSA CA is supported, see: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/certificate_authorities.html %Y%

---++ Jeff's update
   * Still stuck on his Condor-G problem.  Need more examples for Condor-G.
   * Stu will provide Jeff with some performance testing examples. %Y%
   * Six or 7 sites have installed and are working. %Y%
   * Jeff will be build up a set of job types.
      * Type I: simple submit, no I/O involved.   Scale.
      * Type II: data-producing job: return data to user's submit host.  Scale
      * Type III: data-producing job: transfer data to some other designated storage area.  Scale.
      * Type IV: data-consuming job, transfer input data form users's submit host. Scale
      * Type V: data-consuming job, transfer input data from some other designated storage area.  Scale
      * Type VI: data-consuming/data-producing job, to and from the submit host.  Scale.
      * Type VII: data-consuming/data-producing job, from arbitrary endpoints. Scale.
   * Can we put together a tutorial on the time scale of next week?  We at least _start_ a tutorial that we can build on as more applications and communities of interest migrate to WS Gram.
      * How to setup a WS Gram submit host.
      * How to find sites in OSG supporting WS Gram.
      * How to submit simple (eg. Type I) jobs to the OSG.

---++ User testing
   * Stu will point users to the ITB sites initially.  
   * Jeff will provide a twiki/webpage of endpoints.   %Y%, see WsGramOsgSites

---++ Next Meeting
   * Next week we will have the OSG meeting at UCSD.  Suchandra, Jeff, Rob will at least meet informally.  Play by ear whether to setup a call to Stu and Charles from SD.
   * Otherwise next meeting will be *Monday, March 12, 11 am Central*.  A reminder will of course be sent out.
