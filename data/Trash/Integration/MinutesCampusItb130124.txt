---++ Skeleton Key: A Tool for Easing Remote Execution and Data Access - by Suchandra Thapa
Skeleton Key is a script that allows users to easily create job wrappers to allow for running remotely located binaries and to access data using remote file access protocols.  This meeting will go into how to use Skeleton Key to allow jobs to access CVMFS repositories as well as HDFS and POSIX files systems using user space tools allowing for jobs to run on clusters without needing the cluster administrators to install tools first.

---++ BOSCO Testing 
[[%ATTACHURL%/bosco-testing-v2.pdf][bosco-testing-v2.pdf]] gives an overview of different use cases, supported platforms, functionality (smoke tests) and running at scale.

The three main use cases are:
   * single user, single cluster
   * single user, multi cluster
   * multi user
Check Trash/CampusGrids.TestBoSCO for instructions about BOSCO testing.

Horst had some maintenance in his cluster and the OSG release next Tuesday kept him busy. He will perform some tests before the next meeting using his LSF cluster.
