---+!!<nop>OSG ITB CE Install Guide

---++Introduction
This document is intended for site administrators responsible for OSG 
middleware installation and configuration. It is not meant as an all-inclusive install guide.  The instructions
assume the following Linux distributions:

	* Red Hat 9.0</li>

	* Red Hat 7.x
	* Red Hat 9.0
	* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3
Installation may be successful with other Linux distributions, but they have not been tested.
distributions such as Scientific Linux Fermi 3.0.x (x=3,4) and Rocks 3.x (x>=1)
The proposed installation and configuration method is based on <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/">Pacman</a>.  Pacman is a package manager like RPM or dpkg, but is able to work on and support multiple platforms.

---+++Conventions used
The installation and configuration method is based on <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/">Pacman</a>.  Pacman is a package manager like RPM or dpkg, but is able to work on and support multiple platforms.  Specific Pacman directions are given below, and in the pre-installation procedures.

	* <tt>monospaced text</tt> indicates terminal output 
	* <tt><b>bold monospaced text</b></tt> indicates terminal input (by the user)
	* <tt><i>monospaced text in italics</i></tt> indicates variable data that may differ on your installation
	* the <tt>&gt;</tt> prompt indicates commands that do not require a specific shell or root access
	* the <tt>#</tt> prompt indicates commands that require root access
	* the <tt>$</tt> prompt indicates sh- or bash-specific commands
	* the <tt>%</tt> prompt indicates csh- or tcsh-specific commands
	* the =#= prompt indicates commands that require root access

---++Pre-installation Checklist
---+++System or Cluster Already Installed
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should be likewise previously installed and configured, unless you intend to use the Condor system that will be installed with the VDT.	
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should be likewise previously installed and configured, unless you intend to use the Condor system that can optionally be installed with VDT.
---+++Preserving a pre-existing Condor installation
If you would like to preserve your Condor installationyou can setup the installer to recognize it by setting
two environment variables.  Doing so will produce the following effects:
	* Condor will be installed but not configured. 
	* The VDT middleware will point to the necessary locations in your external Condor installation.

To specify an external Condor installation you need to set the following two environment variables before starting the installation:
	* *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION* - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. <i>/opt/condor</i>). The Condor <i>bin/</i>, <i>sbin/</i>, <i>etc/</i>, <i>lib/</i>... directories should be directly under this location.
	* <b>VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG</b> (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is <i>$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config</i>.

==$ export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT==
---+++Existing reliable network
It is assumed that your hardware is connected to a reliable network connection by which the software may be retrieved and from which
services may contact your system.

---+++Time synchronization (NTP) and reverse name lookups (DNS)

Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of eg. proxy lifetimes.

Also for the middleware to correctly function both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system.

---+++Unique OSG Site Name
Each OSG site will need to designate a *unique name* by which services and resources may refer to the site. This name will be displayed on the Site Catalog and used in tables for other monitoring and accounting.  For example, the University of New Mexico has a unique name of UNM_HPC; the University of Buffalo is Buffalo_CCR.
#UniqueName 
---+++Previous Grid3 Installations
 If there is a <i>previous installation</i> of the Grid3 environment or 
 other Globus middleware please <i>stop the processes</i> which are currently running.
 This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), MonALISA and other 
 services configured to start upon initialization on your system.
 More information is provided in the <a href="http://igoc.ivdgl.indiana.edu/grid-install/documentation/grid3-shutdown.html"> 
 Grid3 shutdown document</A>.


---+++Creation and setup of VO accounts
VO accounts need to be created by the system administrator.  The accounts are: 
<ul> <li>cdf</li><li>grase</li><li>fmri</li><li>gadu</li><li>btev</li><li>uscms01</li><li>uscms02</li><li>usatlas1</li>
<li>sdss</li><li>lsc01</li><li>ivdgl</li></ul><p></p>

<p> Ensure that the users are enabled to use the batch queuing system.
</p></li></ol>


---++ Getting Pacman
The Pacman tool downloads a local copy and then installs the software needed for the installation. During the installation, scripts are run
to specially configure the local node. More about using Pacman can be found from the <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman">Pacman documentation</a>. 

<ol>

  <li><b>Download Pacman.</b> <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/%7Eyoussef/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-2.126.tar.gz">Pacman 2.126</a> is the most recent version
  tested with VDT 1.3.2.  <a href="http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz">

  Pacman 3.x</a> also works well with VDT 1.3.2. You can choose
  either version, but our directions are phrased in terms of Pacman
  2. You will find small differences in command-line options between
  the two versions.  Future versions of the VDT will require Pacman
  3.x. If you will be using Pacman version 3 ensure the correct python version 
  is installed and available (2.3.x or newer).
<p>
  To download Pacman 2.126 via wget:
  </p><pre>&gt; <b>wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-2.126.tar.gz </b>
</pre>
  For Pacman 3.x:
  <pre>&gt; <b>wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz </b>
  </li><li><b>Unpack the tarball.</b>  Note that Pacman does not need to 
reside in your VDT directory.

<p>
For Pacman 2.126:
<pre>&gt; <b>tar xzvf pacman-2.126.tar.gz</b></pre>
For Pacman 3.x:
<pre>&gt; <b>tar xzvf pacman.latest.tar.gz</b></pre>
  </li><li><b>Setup your environment to use Pacman.</b> 
<pre>&gt; <b>cd pacman-*</b></pre>

For sh and bash:

<pre>$ <b>source setup.sh</b></pre>
For csh and tcsh:
<pre>% <b>source setup.csh</b></pre>
</pre>
</li></ol>
<p>


---++ Installing the Core OSG Infrastructure

<ol><li>
	 <p> <b>Decide on an installation directory for the software.</b>
This is typically <b>/usr/local/grid</b>, but whatever suits the
local resource structure is fine. If you are installing on a
cluster, this directory must be available on all the nodes. 
If this directory is not shared additional installation of
software will be required on each of the worker nodes. Nearly all of
the software to be installed is from the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT).
The toolkit developers maintain complete and detailed installation instructions for the
software available at the URL<b> &lt;<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/installation-1.3.2.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/installation-1.3.2.html</a>&gt;. </b>
</p><p> The installation described here is done as root.  However, non-root
installs are supported.  Not all services will run as root; Condor, 
MonALISA and the GRIS will run as the user "daemon". If you prefer to run
MonALISA and/or Condor with its own UID, you need only to create a 
<b>monalisa</b> and/or <b>condor</b> user before proceeding with installation the VDT will configure the daemons appropriately.  <I>If you install as root, verify that the umask is set to "0022" prior to installation.  Failure to do so may render the installation unusable.</I>

</p>
<p>Create and change into your VDT directory.  For the purposes of this document,
the directory will be <b>/usr/local/grid</b>.  It is suggested that you set 
assign the variable <b>$VDT_LOCATION</b> to the VDT directory.</p>
<p>For sh and bash:
<pre>$ <b>VDT_LOCATION=/usr/local/grid; export VDT_LOCATION; cd $VDT_LOCATION</b></pre>
<p>For csh and tcsh:
<pre>% <b>setenv VDT_LOCATION /usr/local/grid; cd $VDT_LOCATION</b></pre>
<p> A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is
downloaded will be displayed. Please answer <b>y</b> (yes) so that the
software can be retrieved. </p>

<pre>
&gt; <b>pacman -get iVDGL:osg-0.1.2</B> 
Do you want to add [iVDGL] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>
Package [osg] found in [iVDGL]...

Do you want to add [http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_132_cache] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>
...

...
</pre>
If you plan to use Condor, answer <b>y</b> (yes) to the question posed regarding setting up the Condor job manager.  
By default, a personal-condor instance is installed to facilitate testing.<br>

<pre>If you would like, we can set up a Globus jobmanager interface
to Condor.

This will allow Globus Gatekeeper to run jobs on Condor.

Would you like to enable Globus jobmanager for Condor?
Choices: y (yes), n(no), s (skip this question) <b>y</b>
</pre>
<p>
 Other questions may be asked it is safe to answer <b>n</b> (no).
</p>

<p><b>This will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending
upon the system and network connection.</b> The installation should complete
with the following message. During this time you may open a second 
terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the <b>vdt-install.log</b> file.</p>
</li>

<li>
  <b>Set up your environment.</b>  Assuming the Pacman install completed without
fatal errors, you should now be able to source the OSG setup environment.

  <li> <b><i>Optional extra packages for PBS, LSF, or FBSng setup</i></b><br>

	 <p> An extra package will be required to setup access to an
existing PBS, LSF, or FBSng installation. 
<b>Ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system 
are in your path,</b> then install the appropriate package (for PBS, LSF, or 
FBSng, respectively): </p>

</p><p>
  One of the parameters specifies a <i>local</i> <b>grid-mapfile</b> that
  will be added to the output of the <b>edg-mkgridmap</b> command.
</p> There are two steps to make this work:
<ol>
  <li>Set the <B>GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE</B> variable in 
	 <B>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</B> :
<pre><B>GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE=$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local</B></pre>
</li>
<li>Add a new directive to the end of the <B>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</B> :
<pre><b>gmf_local <I>/usr/local/grid</I>/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local</b></pre>
</li>
</ol>
	
  Now local <b>grid-mapfile</b> entries to this file will be 
  added every time the script is executed.

Site Verification</a>

<h3>Site verify script checks<br>
	 </h3>
  
To verify many of the installed OSG software components, download and
execute the <b>site_verify.pl</b> (Perl) script.  The script itself is available at the URL &lt;<a href="http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify.pl">http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify.pl</a>&gt;.  Documentation can be found at &lt;<a href="http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html">http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify_pl.html</a>&gt;.

To download and run the site verify script:

<pre>&gt; <b>wget http://griddev.uchicago.edu/download/grid3/doc.pkg/WIP/site_verify.pl</b>
&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>. ./setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>grid-proxy-init "<i>Your Passphrase"</i></b>
&gt; <b>perl site_verify.pl --host=<i>hostname.domain.tld</i></b></pre><br clear="all">
  <br>
The Grid Exerciser application will attempt to execute on this site. </p>
<h4>MonALISA and its information providers </h4>
<p>
Launch the MonALISA client tool from the URL &lt;<a href="http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html">http://gocmon.uits.iupui.edu:8888/index.html</a>&gt;.
The client is launched from the "Start MonALISA Client" button on the
top of the left hand menu. On the running MonaALISA (ML) client, check
that your site is reporting to ML and that it is correct geographical
location (mouse over the dot and it will display the site name, make
sure it is the name you picked out that conforms to the naming
convention). 

To check that the various information providers are
reporting to ML go to the TabPan view (on the left hand menu bar) and
check that all of the table entries for your site are providing
information, compare with other sites. If there are "Unknown" entries
in the fields then most likely there is error in the ML configuration
files you modified.&nbsp; Please go through the instructions and
contact iGOC if you need help. <br>

<p>
To register the site into the Grid Catalog please 
compose an email which contains the following information
and send it to the igoc at ivdgl.org - copy/paste the text
below in the body:
<pre>

  Information about you and your machine(s)

  Short_Site_Name (a.k.a UNIQUE Name)
  Host_Name

Network traffic can be blocked at the firewall for both incoming and outgoing dataflow
depending on hostnames, ip addresses, ports and protocols. 


A common setup is to allow any outgoing connection,

It is strong encouraged that you read the document <A HREF="http://www.globus.org/security/v2.0/firewalls.html">Globus Toolkit Firewall Requirements</A> to avoid issues which may arise from firewall configuration.
