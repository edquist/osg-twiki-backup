      * Charles: _I'm out in Edinburgh this week for a meeting, so this will be a quickie update.  I figured out how to get the managedfork jobmanager working with WS-GRAM last week.  As a side effect, I also got Neha's cemon jobmanager working with WS-GRAM.  I provided the details to Alain Roy, but he was caught up in the OSG 0.8 release process, so didn't have a chance to test.  I wound up giving the instructions to Terrence Martin, and together we noodled out how to make it the default jobmanager._
