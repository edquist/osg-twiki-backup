   * Reports from [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/wiki/bin/view/OSG/WeekOct29][Suchandra Thapa]], [[Trash/Integration.JeffPorterWeeklyOct29][Jeff Porter]], [[Trash/OSGReports.RobWeekOct29][Rob Gardner]], Trash/OSGReports.CharlesBacon
      * Charles: _I'm out in Edinburgh this week for a meeting, so this will be a quickie update.  I figured out how to get the managedfork jobmanager working with WS-GRAM last week.  As a side effect, I also got Neha's cemon jobmanager working with WS-GRAM.  I provided the details to Alain Roy, but he was caught up in the OSG 0.8 release process, so didn't have a chance to test.  I wound up giving the instructions to Terrence Martin, and together we noodled out how to make it the default jobmanager._

   * Thursday's integration meeting: Trash/Integration.MinutesNov1

   * ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome is still a wreck - major holes for storage
