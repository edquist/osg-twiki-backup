   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB090/SiteValidationTable][Validation Table]]
      * Interoperability: Trying to overcome manpower vacuum last week, just now able to excersize some of the ITB compute elements 
         * some problems not finding wn-client softarefor  globus file transfer
         * some ITBs (CIT & Purdue) appear to not support ops VO
         * may be an operational issue with BDII flushing data at a faster rate than CEMon updates 
         * storage elements test had some problem at fermigrid, while UC & BNL SE's didn't support OPS VO 
      * SE validation table
         * RSV probe requires update for directory name change
         * FNAL-SE validated other categories successfully.     
         * BNL found problems with Replica manager reported to Storage Group
         * UC will continue validating gratia & report later in the week
         * LBNL - most columns are not applicable to Bestman, though it is passing nightly tests. Working on GIP configuration


---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Validations (Abhishek)

   * Green lights from 7 of the 12 participating VOs.  
      * DZero (1 of the 7) & LBNL are still debugging what looks like a site-specific (non-OSG) issue
   * Atlas and CMS are limiting tests to their own ITB sites and will likely sign off soon
   * Engage and SBGrid appear satisfied but may or may not still test opportunistic storage
      * Jeff and Abhishek think they should try to finish up by Thursday's meeting
   * CDF 
      * successfully tested SE on 3 of 4 with the essential problem having been a fnal/kerberos non-osg bug. 
      * successfully tested CE on 3 of 5 sites and will hopefully wrap up Validation this week
