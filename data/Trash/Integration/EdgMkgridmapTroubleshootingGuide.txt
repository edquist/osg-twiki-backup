---+!!<nop>edg-mkgridmap Troubleshooting Guide
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction
This document is intended to provide some assistance in troubleshooting problems  related to use of the edg-mkgridmap script and edg-makegridmap-upgrade daemon used to maintain  the CE/gatekeerper node grid-mapfile based members pulled from the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers.

This does not address retrieval of members from LDAP servers.


---++ Error code 64
This type of error generally occurs when the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server cannot find the requested group or subgroup.  Contact with the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server was made and it is really a 'not found' type error.  It is caused by a bad entry in the <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file.

The example below is attempting to access all members of  the uscms VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo belonging to the /uscms/production group.

Configuration file (VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf) entry:<br>
<pre>
   group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/uscms/production uscms01
</pre>
Command run on CE node:
<pre>
  &gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.(c)sh
  &gt;  cd $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin
  &gt;  ./edg-mkgridmap
   <i>... output....
   voms search(https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/uscms/production/services/VOMSAdmin?method=listMembers): /voms/uscms/production/services/VOMSAdmin

   Exit with error(s) (code=64)</i>
</pre>
On the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS host you are attempting to access, the following error can be seen in the TOMCAT_LOCATION/logs/voms-admin.VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_NAME.log
  <pre>
