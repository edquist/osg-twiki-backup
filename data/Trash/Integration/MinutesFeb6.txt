   * Tanya has fixed the memory leak problem - there is a jar file available.
   * Also, backported the raw format plugin into 1.7.2.  Two machines running, testing for stability.  Question - is the information correct?  John R should check the results.
   * There are three using this raw dialect plugin.
   * How shall we test this?  John: make sure all DN's are complete and clean. 
   * There is an osg-info wrapper that can be run at the site, to collect attributes.
   * Ransom - has perl script that does a comparision.

   * Est by Thursday, would release 1.6.1a on Fri or Mon.
   * Which version of Glue schema? 1.3 from Laurence Field, should be backwards compatible.  Is the BDII affected?  Probably needs to be tested.
