---++ Specific Instructions for OSG 1.2.10

---+++ Test Bestman/Xrootd software
Install the software as outlined in the release documentation.  Make sure that you can upload, download, and delete files and verify that files downloaded from your SE are the same as the files that you uploaded.

---+++ Test srm-lbnl clients
To test the update to the srm-lbnl client, use the client to upload, download, remove, and list files on a SE and verify that uploaded files match the downloaded files.

---+++ Test apache changes
Apache was updated to correct a potential security issue.   After installation, please visit =http://your.server:8443/= to verify that apache is working correctly.  Also, verify that your ress, bdii, and rsv reports are being sent to the central collectors.
 
---+++ Test the new 'itb' keyword for installing certificates

When running vdt-ca-manage, install from the new ITB URL.  This should be done for all ITB sites.

Note: make sure to pick the appropriate location for your site.

<pre class="screen">
vdt-ca-manage setupca --url itb --location &lt;local|root|PATH&gt;
</pre>

   1. Are certificates installed successfully?
   1. Does any ITB-specific documentation need updating to remind admins to always install from this new URL?
