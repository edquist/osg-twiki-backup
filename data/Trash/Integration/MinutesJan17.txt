---++ Gratia wishlist (Chris Green)
   * In final stages of WLCG cross accounting 
   * Haven't discussed distinction between resource and site name for gratia, will have discussions on this
      * Use case BNL, cluster is provided by both STAR and ATLAS 
      * Something similar done with FNAL and CMS cluster
      * Can be solved by having multiple hostnames associated with a single site name? -- OIM project is moving towards this
   * Resource/site name will start being separated 
   * Discussion will continue at gratia accounting meeting 
      * Wednesday 2008/01/23 at 1.30pm Central. (510) 665-5437, ID #2966
   * Wishlist:
      * Ability to distinguish resource ownership within a cluster
      * Ability to distinguish different resources within a site
      * Ability to distinguish different job submission methods (OSG interface, local, PANDA)

---++ Interoperability (Burt)
   * GIP works needs to be done, not all storage fields being advertised
   * Storage elements won't be recognized out of the box 
   * GIP meeting will be convened in order to resolve this
   * Efforts are coming back up to speed
   * Issue with multiple gatekeepers per site: sites look like separate sites rather than separate gatekeepers for the same site
   * Followup from Alan Sill: WLCG jobs don't seem to respect OSG variables, best way to get this working.  Might be LSF specific 
      * Burt and Alan will follow up offline
 
---++ ITB release cycle

   * More concrete schedule and end date will be established after next week's review
