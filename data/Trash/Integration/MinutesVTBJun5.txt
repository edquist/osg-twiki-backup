---++ WS Gram testing (Jeff)
   * Ran series of tests from his OSP2 host - 10-15% go into HOLD, but these could be releases and re-run.  The problem starts above 200 jobs.  Reliably was able to do 600-700 jobs.  
   * Move over to UN submit host. All jobs go into a hold state with the same error (a stage-in error).
   * Martin will troubleshoot the UN submit host tonight.
   * Will redo tests from OSGP2 with longer job times.
   * Will redo tests from the various job types.
   * Can we set Jeff up at t2dev.  
   * Need to look at the submit host settings.

---++ WS Gram development (Stu)
   * On track to have things completed for the 4.0.5 track, by Friday.
   * Will not get the gridftp connection caching in.  Hopefully update for a later release of VDT, in time for OSG 0.8.

---++ VTB status (Suchandra)
   * UC: Installed using VDT 1.7.0; basic functionality there. 
   * LBL: sucessfully installed, with PBS job manager. Site-verify passed.  Probs with Syslog-ng problems in vdt-control part.  Suchandra sent link with work-arounds.
   * John W: will do tonight.  There are some new questions - auto-install may fail. 
   * John R: will do tomorrow. 
   * Know shortcomings
      * For CEMon - goes to the ITB !ReSS server
      * For BDII - need to put this into the configure script the VTB BDII setup by John.  Q: what version of Glue schema does this VDT 1.7.0 use?  It uses Glue 1.2?
    * Need to check Gratia accounting

---++ Syslog-ng logging status of VTB (all)
   * Expect small changes to go into VDT 1.7.1.
   * Will be collecting logfiles to a VTB logging host.

---++ ITB 0.7 release description/web
   * Kyle will need to create this.
   * Subversion web interface doesn't work correctly on GOC instance - Suchandra and John worked on this a while ago.  Rob Q needs to get this setup for a number of other reasons.  There was a problem with the Insurrection piece.
