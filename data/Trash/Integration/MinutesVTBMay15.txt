---++ Introduction
   * Attendees: Suchandra, Rob, Alain, Martin, Stu, Jeff, Rob
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MinutesVTBMay8, MinutesMay10
   * Background
      * WSGramValidation, and WsGramOsgSites
      * SysLogNg

---++ WS Gram testing
   * Were UNL results reproduced? 
   * Suchandra spoke with Brian - used standard RHEL4 w/ tweaks for TCP buffer sizes and Globus 4.0.4.  The only differnce Suchandra could see was use of Globus distribution versus the VDT version.  Not sure whether he has upgraded to OSG 0.6 yet.  Awating reply.
   * Alain notes that VDT 1.6 is based on Globus 4.0.3, patched from the _community branch_ - there are quite a few. 
   * Note that 4.0.4 does have bug-fixes not in 4.0.3.
   * But, Stu notes there are features in 4.0.3 + patches that are not in 4.0.4.
   * But over all, there is nothing that seems to stand out in any changes.
  
---++ Other slowness investigations (Stu)
   * When gram submits with RFT - lots of ws calls are involved.  Delays in notification between RFT and gram, sometimes up to 10 seconds under load.  There is a notification queue where things are slowing down. 
   * Or, internalize RFT within gram.  Methods for local calls - to avoid authentication, serialization steps, etc.
   * Single job submission - was taking 7 seconds (stage-in, stage-out, cleanup job) - improved by factor 2.  These were 10KB size files.  Concurrency tests with Condor-G as well. 
   * Encouraging results for staging-mode. 
   * Also will cache gridftp connections between two service points.
   * Can we get this into a pre-release of VDT - for VTB testing.  Alain would like to get to Globus 4.0.5.  Charles suggested basing this on Globus 4.0.4.  Alain would like to discuss this with Stu and Charles.
   * Note: we want to ship OSG 0.8.0 by Aug 15.

---++ Next steps in WS gram: testing, development?
   * Consult Brian again on OSG 0.6 testing.
   * Getting patches into VDT.
   * We can also drop changes directly into UC VTB site ("edge5").  Can replace jar files - might need to create them first; replace config.
   * This week Alain will meet with Stu, Charles, et al.

---++ Next VTB cycle
   * Without disrupting the WS gram testing it would be good to cycle the VTB with the latest VDT release - including these Globus redevelopments.
   * Pending VDT-Globus meeting

---++ LBL report (Jeff)
   * Setup WS gram, osp1.lbl.gov - running functional tests, with 50 batch slots.
   * Notes that file number descriptors change is not listed on recommended configuration changes.
   * Condor-G submission with change for pending-submits - will do.

---++ AOB
   * David reports that the new OSG WS-gram site at U Milwaukee was fixed.
