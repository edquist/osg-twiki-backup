---++ Background
The OSG Integration Project is the set of deliverables and milestones organized and effort-loaded within the OSG project to provide systems-level rapid, iterative, first-level integration of VDT and other components of the OSG environment, providing feedback to the VDT team and other service/tool developers.  The activity works within the overall OSG release and deployment process

   *  ET --> VDT <--> VTB --> ITB --> OSG

and provides a core Validation Testbed (VTB) using project-funded dedicated effort.  It also contributes to the broadly-scoped and larger scale Integration Testbed (ITB) through coordination, larger scale service testing and documentation.  The detailed interactions and feedback channels within the release and deployment process are being discussed, but the following main themes are emerging:
   * The VTB scope and size is limited to provide rapid grid-releases and feedback to VDT and other service developers.
   * The VTB is focused on service-to-service interactions and validation and grid-systems level integration.
   * The VTB works closely with the VDT team providing early pre-release grid-systems level testing and feedback as part of their software integration process.
   * The ITB does the above but on a larger scale with broader participation from site-admins and VO applications validators.

---++ Project Scope
See https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=530.

The VTB program of work includes:
   * A middleware systems-level description and implied architecture of an OSG functional set, reduced as appropriate for the scale and resources of the VTB.
   * Rapid feedback and spark testing of pre-VDT releases as deployed in grid systems.
   * First-pass functional testing of integrated services based on VDT software.
   * Provision/adoption of systems-level testing and validation frameworks
   * Validation tests, with focus on functional testing. 
   * An ITB release candidate for deployment on the  full ITB for broad, pre-deployment testing and VO validation and sign-off.
   * A physical infrastructure to support all of the above.

The ITB program of work includes overall coordination of the ITB and its activies leading to provisioned, VO-validated and approved OSG releases
   *  ITB release candidates 0.5.x (0.7.x) for the ITB
   * System tests and validation for new services with focus on performance and scalability.
   * ITB Operations coordinates (includes effort from Operations):
      * Validation of VO software frameworks.
      * Provide facility documentation
      * Write administration configuration and frequently asked questions guide for Site Administrators
      * Complete Integration leading to OSG 0.6.0 (OSG 0.8.0) production releases

The partitioning of effort between VTB and ITB focused work depends on the frequency of OSG, ITB, and VDT releases.  It is estimated that once a VDT<-->VTB cycles have converged on an ITB release candidate, that a week of ITB work is required for the core project effort participants which covers deployment and configuration into ITB and and VO testing they are responsible for (eg. LIGO application testing at CIT).  Deliverables include:
   * VTB: Validation testbed: a distributed systems-level platform for functional testing, first-look integration evaluation, feedback to OSG Software groups.
   * ITB: coordination, provisioned ITB grid-level services, etc.


---++ Effort and Reporting
Efforts come into the Integration project through various channels, both OSG-dedicated and contributed, see IntegrationEffortReporting.

---++ Site definitions and responsibilities
---+++ Components
The VTB will have a flexible and distributed infrastructure for hosting services required for OSG required systems tests.  VTB sites (A, B, C and G=GOC-hosted) will provide infrastructure and effort to host system elements comprising the VTB.  A preliminary set of VTB components include: 

   * CE_n: compute elements
      * CE services may be distributed over one or more hosts.
      * WN_n: worker node testing
   * SE_n: storage elements, n >= 1
      * This may be multiple servers depending on the OSG SE under test.  For example, a 
   * ES_n: edge service elements
   * CI_n: client interface hosts (client testing, job submission host, workload generator) 
   * VTB GUMS service host
   * VTB VOMS service host
   * VTB information service host
   * VTB resource selection service collector/discovery host
   * VTB monitoring service host
   * VTB accounting service host

Some of these services may be combined on hosts.  In addition, we envision a multi-site VTB infrastructure monitor and configuration database to emulate a single site facility.
   * VTB facility monitor - providing web-visible feedback and monitoring data of combined services.
   * VTB configuration database
   * VTB metrics data and reduced performance results archival

---+++ Activities
   * Preparation and administration of physical infrastructure.
   * Grid-packaging: preparation of pacman ITB release candidates for VTB components.
   * Liaison with VDT for pre-release testing and release description. 
   * Liaison with Users, Software, and ET for functional specification requirements.
   * Provision of a testing framework - use best of breed, customize for VTB, use for configuration management and report generation.
   * Trash/Deployment cycles - initial development of deployment procedures, functional validation testing, documentation.
   * Perform functional tests and certify results.


---++ Execution
The project will be executed within the overall project execution plan (PEP) which will include task and priority assignment, regular effort reporting, schedule and milestone evaluation, and reviews.

---+++!! 8/23/06: Planning notes from Consortium meeting breakout
   * Emphasize the validation process so that changes and patches come through quickly.
   * Enahance/formalize interaction with nightly testing systems and release cycle of VDT.
   * Develop a set of questions the VTB should be expected to answer.   
   * See ITB as the environment for scalability, application features, and performance testing by VOs.
   * Interaction with EGEE certification activities, especially with regard to interoperability.
   * VTB should receive feedback from the production site administrators - things that may not have been caught at the VDT or other software development teams.
   * Should the VTB support all flavors of batch queuing systems?  Cannot test all combinations, but the VTB should express what tests/service combinations were performed.

---+++!! 9/13/06: More notes
   * See where VDT self-testing ends, where ITB starts, define the middle better.
   * Immediate infrastructure issues. Need some hardware.
   * Evaluation of testing frameworks.  See, eg., http://etics.cern.ch/nmi/.  What about John Weigand's scripts?  Other VDT tools.
   * Start with raw VDT.

---+++!! 12/18/06 Project coordination notes
   * Firming up effort levels and a VTB meeting this week.
