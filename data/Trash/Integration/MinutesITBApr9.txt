Hey Suchandra,

Sorry to bring up an old thread, but this was never resolved.  John W. needed to use some site-local settings and was unable to.

Since configure-osg.py overwrites the osg-job-local-environment.conf whenever it is run, we need a mechanism to actually make that file useful.

The attached patch implements what Burt recommended in Dec 2008 and provides a unittest to make sure we don't regress.

Hi Burt,

As we discussed at the gip meeting, I'm correcting the first issue.  For the second issue, I'm looking at solutions but I'm still considering solutions.  Are there others aware of any other options that are case sensitive?

Hi Suchandra,

We noticed that configure-osg.py overwrites osg-local-job-environment.conf.  I see there's provision for [Local Settings] in the config.ini to write out this file, but there's two problems with the current implementation:

First, if you create a Local Settings section, it populates the osg-local-job-environment.conf with the config.ini defaults (ie: admin_email, localhost, and a few others).

Second, the config parser is case-insensitive.  I can change that by adding something like

config.optionxform = lambda x: x

just after instantiation in read_config_file (with the penalty that other config items are now case-sensitive too).
