*Last week*:
   * Initial testing packages available in VTB cache
   * Sites:
      * LBNL
      * FNAL
      * BNL *no update*
      * UC_ITB
      * LIGO_CIT
      * TTU (if server can be brought back up)  *no update*
   * Backup:
      * Make sure to backup files with ownership, permissions, symlinks, modification times, as much information as possible
      * A tarball can't be used with updater script verify since the script verify checks permissions, ownerships, etc.  
   * Update method being used by sites
      * LBNL (Updater script)
      * FNAL (Both)
      * BNL (Updater script) *no update*
      * UC_ITB (Both)
      * LIGO_CIT (pacman updates)
      * TTU (pacman updates)  *no update*
   * SE:
      * Sites participating:
         * UC_ITB 
         * LBNL
         * Storage group 
*this week:*
   * Waiting on Tim to put latest version into the VTB cache
   * LBL, CIT-LIGO, FNAL will testing this.
   * For a Bestman SE update, need instructions to do this by-hand; Tanya (but please wait for that test).  *LBNL (Iwona)*


---++ Validation of Gratia probes for SEs 
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB092/SiteValidationTable#SE_validation
   * We need to test Gratia probes for dCache: UC & FNAL - probably early next week.
   * Split SE validation table into BM and dCache;  *please update tests*
   * Iwona - working on Gratia probe for bm-xrootd, but timing wasn't good - didn't have final bundle.  Now has some missing packages.  Recommendation to wait for update, or do a fresh install. 

---++ New dCache release
   * Fresh install upgrade.
   * Will do this at UC_ITB_SE, but not until next week at the earliest.


---++ Other validations
   * [[Trash/Trash/Integration/ITB092/TestingAndValidation][ITB testing and validation page (main)]]  - includes link to the *site validation table*
   * No significant issues.


---++ Any remaining VO issues?
   * None reported here.


---++ Configure-osg issue
   * Suchandra will need to incorporate Brian patch, place in ITB cache
   * Need a test afterwards.
   * Want to put into the ini file local settings.  Patch has python 2.4 or greater.  John W investigating.  Needs to be consistent with the platforms that VDT supports.

Hey Suchandra,
Sorry to bring up an old thread, but this was never resolved.  John W. needed to use some site-local settings and was unable to.
Since configure-osg.py overwrites the osg-job-local-environment.conf whenever it is run, we need a mechanism to actually make that file useful.
The attached patch implements what Burt recommended in Dec 2008 and provides a unittest to make sure we don't regress.

Hi Burt,
As we discussed at the gip meeting, I'm correcting the first issue.  For the second issue, I'm looking at solutions but I'm still considering solutions.  Are there others aware of any other options that are case sensitive?

Hi Suchandra,

We noticed that configure-osg.py overwrites osg-local-job-environment.conf.  I see there's provision for [Local Settings] in the config.ini to write out this file, but there's two problems with the current implementation:
First, if you create a Local Settings section, it populates the osg-local-job-environment.conf with the config.ini defaults (ie: admin_email, localhost, and a few others).
Second, the config parser is case-insensitive.  I can change that by adding something like

config.optionxform = lambda x: x

just after instantiation in read_config_file (with the penalty that other config items are now case-sensitive too).

---++ GUMS problem (aside)
   * gums 1.3.14 problem - recommendation is to get rid of match-fqan attribute, put it back into exact.  This has to be changed in the template.  There is email from John Weigand going around.


---++ Steps toward production release
   * Complete any remaining testing steps.
   * Production 10.0.1 cache packages need to be prepared - *Suchandra and Arvind* will handle this.
   * Documentation changes need to be migrated into ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome - *Suchandra and Kyle*
   * *Shoot for April 22 as release date for OSG 1.0.1*
