---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  Charles, Rob, Suchandra, Jeff, Burt
   * Apologies: 
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 4:00pm Central; 510-665-5437, *#1212*
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes 

---++ VDT release schedule

   * Expect VTB testing late this week or early next week

---++ GIP Testing (Burt)

   * described many changes, both fixes to 0.8 and new features
      * need to verify changes work correctly on each LRM
      * need to be able to back out changes in case catastrophic failure
         * expect this to be a VDT issue but willing to run tests specific to VTB if that will help
      * new support for dcache SE connected to CE
   * need to provide more information about validating the information
      * could be a product of the VTB cycle
 
---++ VTB sites and cache

   * [[ValidationTestbed#Sites_and_Services][VTB sites]]
      * UC with pbs/torque
         * may be able to add condor site if needed
      * LBNL: 1 with sge and 1 with pbs/torque
      * fermilab nightly build condor site
      * Caltech/LIGO - assume not for this cycle?
      * GOC?


---++ Site Admin tools

   * From general discussions throughout meeting:
      * General Nagios-RSV pluggin
      * Gratia Filters for filtering what is sent to remote collector
         * Test and promote Gratia local collector
      * WS Gram job record database
      * single sign-on web authentication e.g. mod_gsi
      * rsv probes to validate basic VO support at site
   * discussed during tools session
      * MOPS 
      * Fermigrid High availability
         * Xen packaged servers (how to docs or more?) for GUMS, VOMS, and ...
         * Xen packeged CE with scripts for restart/replacement
      * Caltech/CMS
         * logwatch for common/reoccuring errors
         * nagios panel (currently only for cemon)
         * condor batch monitoring tool - nice but specific to condor and not easily to support other LRMs

General discussion focused on defining a few low hanging fruit for packaging/promoting to the site administrators. It's probably worth reviewing the list of tools generated by the original email request.  But currently 3 good choices are ushering the Nagios-RSV connection, the local Gratia collector, and perhaps the log-watch tools from Caltech/CMS.
