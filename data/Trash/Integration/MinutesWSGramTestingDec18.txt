%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  Jeff, Stu, Suchandra, Terrence, Charles
   * Apologies: none
   * Coordinates: Tuesday, 3:30pm Central; 510-665-5437, #1212
   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes

---++ Scalability testing

   * Suchandra's local invocations tests
      * earlier tests didn't have maxThreads reset to higher value. Did that (set to 200) and 
         * container no longer crashes at 1Hz submission rate
         * local invocation now gives superior response
      * put in request to vdt-support to have increased maxthreads level set by default.
   * Jeff's client timeout tests
      * globusrun-ws option '-T #' did not seem to work or I set it too low (~10 minutes)
      * adding <i>containerTimeout</i> parameter in server-config.wsdd file and setting to 1000000 (~16 minutes) did work
         * 370 out of 375 jobs went through successfully
         * 5 jobs failed with <pre class=screen> ....
Current job state: StageOut
Current job state: Failed
Destroying job...Done.
Cleaning up any delegated credentials...Done.
globusrun-ws: Job failed: Staging error for RSL element fileStageOut.
Message expired (outside window)
</pre>
   *  Charles says these results point to the server container (not the client-container) as having the timeout.  And small number of failures may be a security catch all whereby any message carries a time-limit.
   * Terrence's Condor-g testing at UCSD
      * just now was able to push the service into operation by running the seg by hand.  
      * still an open question why this doesn't work when container is started initially
      * will start running tests with Condor-g

---++ OSG Integration activities (Charles)

   * How to address 3 issues (interop, accounting, log-rotation)
      * reporting: Stu notes that supporting log-rotation in Condor is underway or persons identified
      * accounting: there are outstanding bug reports from John Wiegand that spell out the issues ... followup from there
      * interop:  Charles needs to re-ignite email thread based on CE element from GlueSchema 1.3   
   * Involvement of Big VOs 
      * CMS involvement will follow Terrence's tests
      * Atlas contact made 

---++ To Do List

   * submit bug report for <i>maxAttempts</i> not working (Jeff)
   * Suchandra will be running through Condor-g tests Types I - VII
   * Charles to follow up on accounting & reporting
   * Jeff will be finishing SGE log-rotation and following up on SGE/Globus interations 
   * All will have fun over the holidays
