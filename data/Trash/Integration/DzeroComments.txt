5 jobs to fgitb-gk.fnal.gov all failed.  3 failed because of file transfer problems which may be due to Samgrid infrastructure problems.  2 failed because:

mkdir: cannot create directory `/local/stage1/samgrid_temp_dir.fgitb124.fnal.gov.24483': Permission denied
mkdir: cannot create directory `/local/stage1/samgrid_temp_dir.fgitb124.fnal.gov.24482': Permission denied

Please fix the permissions and I will retry.

7/1 Steve says not to use fgitb-gk.fnal.gov.  Job to gridtest01.racf.bnl.gov failed to store final output file in SAM.  This is most likely a Samgrid infrastructure problem.  I'm retrying.  No word from uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu.  Job to grolsch.lbl.gov.ssb was held.  This is a samgrid infrastructure problem.  I am retrying.  Jobs submitted to cit-itb.ultralight.org on 6/29 still pending.
