     Charged to bring the common envirnoment to the worker node in a consistent way.
     (using the globus-job-manager.conf or batch_manager.pm)

       Still thinking various ways to handle.. 

---++++ GIP configuration updates 

   * Current Issues

   1. osg_vo - use grid3-vo-user-map.txt
   1. PBS, SGE, LSF  scripts needed..
   1. publish locations informaiton like it was from $VDT_LOCATION/edg/var... vo files
       into the env.


   To preserve nonOSG installations configure_gip to look for and fail if VO stuff not found.
   Bockjoo will provide concrete example of SRM SE type configuration
   Will setup and publish installation package for new GIP after these issues are
     addressed or next week.


---++++ OSG installation and Validation

         Daily build effort ongoing by John Wiegand. OSG 0.2.1 daily build box where the software is
         downloaded freshly installed / configured. Will
         register resource in to the OSG Production and publish with GridCat.

---++++ Status of VDT 1.3.7    
         
   1. 1.3.7 not ready for a couple of weeks..
   1. OSG ITB pre-release packages will be available early next week

---++++ osg-general mailing list for user questions
---++++ More talk about requirements for  $DATA and data workflow for applications 
      * Need to define the delete critiera for $DATA, or $TMP
      * Perhaps leave $DATA alone and create "DEFAULTSE" to hold this information.
      * Will add for next week
---++++ MIS VO
      * This is for the CI infrastructure - main customers are GridCat and ACDC.
      * adding MIS VO to ITB ok, used as a collaboration point with LCG
---++++ Addition of SRM client tools (srm-cp)
      *  command line arguments can be used to fix the problem on firewalled hosts (cog.properties). 
          This can be added for OSG ITB next release.
      * Craig will submit bug re: cog.properties for firewall port range to globus.

    
---+++ topics left from last week


   * Fermilab VO: Steve Timm and Dan Yocum
     * This is Fermigrid; VOMS 
   * LIGO
     * LIGO VOMS has been up for a month - we should start using it.
   * An email should be sent out describing how to to include these VOs. 
   * We need the authoritive list of VOs that are being supported.
   * Alan suggests adding a way of updating a component in the software cache in between releases.  Have a daily cron script update automatically, only for particular scripts.  Can this be handled in Pacman?  Saul thinks so.  Separate out a pacman cache that is more volatile, and updated regularly?

   * GT4 readiness
      * See the WSGramServiceReadinessPlan off the GlobusOSG page. VDT schedule?
   * Policy information
      * New activity forming for Policy.
      * Need to follow up on the short term publication proposal.
   * Addition of SRM client tools (srm-cp)
        *  command line arguments can be used to fix this problem.
