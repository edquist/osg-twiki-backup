---++ Squid validation status
   * Carryover from last meeting: *OU will volunteer as a site for squid, will report next week*
Squid validation exercise has been completed successfully from the ITB (OUHEP_ITB) server and the WNs. Squid was installed separately from the OSG-0.7.0 main installation and the server started. configure-osg.sh was ran and the details of squid provided. configure_squid failed complaining that the squid installation wasn't found under the main osg-0.7.0 installation. But strangely this didn't seem to affect squid in any way. Running configure-osg.sh updated the osg-attributes.conf file with the OSG_SQUID_LOCATION attribute. wget test was done on the server and it succeeded (MISS followed by a HIT). wget tests were also done by submitting jobs to the ITB cluster through globus-job-run (so that the job executes on a WN) and it did pass as expected (OSG_SQUID_LOCATION was understood and MISS was followed by a HIT). Feedback has been provided to Dave Dykstra about these tests and it has been concurred that the validation was successful. A GOC ticket has been opened (ticket number 4150) for the configure-osg.sh issue as discussed above. Thanks to Dave, Steve & Horst for the help during the tests.
