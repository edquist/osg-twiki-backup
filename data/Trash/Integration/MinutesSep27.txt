---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo validation status (Charles, Abhishek)
Here is an  update for this week -

As you know, ATLAS completed validation on UC_ITB. From CMS, I am 
requesting Haifeng Pi to see if he can possibly validate CMS 
jobs/storage on UCSDT2-ITB1. nanoHUB and LIGO performed another round 
of validation, and had more results this week. Charles is in contact 
with Steve/nanoHUB and 2 sites that did not succeed for nanoHUB jobs.

This time, we are trying not to bother VOs too much (keeping in mind 
the email discussion we had a few weeks ago, and advice from Ruth and 
Frank). I will send a short reminder to CompBioGrid, Dzero, DOSAR, 
Engage, STAR tomorrow. Btw, did you hear back from Mike for iVDGL?

regards,
Abhishek

   * Need to check CDF contact
   * Horst will post some info for DOSAR on the page
   * iVDGL - keep for now, since we have more time
   * LIGO - still failing on three sites.  UC_ITB - failing, but not sure why.
   * Nanohub - auth problems on BNL
   * SDSS - finished all tests
   * STAR


   * From Charles
<pre>
ATLAS:  Abhishek informed me atlas run on the local UC_ITB site, but have not seen post result to the twiki page yet
CDF: not hear anything back yet
CMS: Abhishek is going to inform his colleague to run a simply job on local CMS site at UCSDT2-ITB1
CompBioGrid: not hear anything back yet
DOSAR: not hear anything back yet  (I am not sure whether Horst belongs to DOSAR, and whether he can have some influence on the testing)
Dzero: not hear anything back yet
Engage: not hear anything back yet
FERMILAB: finished all test
IVDGL: not hear anything back yet
LIGO: validate both CE and SE, all SE site test successful, currently 3 site fails on the CE test (UC_ITB, CIT_ITB_1, UCSDT2-ITB1)
nanoHUB: only validate CE, two sites have problems (BNL_ITB_Test1, UCSDT2-ITB1)
SDSS/DES: finished all test
STAR: finished all test, will validate on the fail sites again soon. Charles have sent the fail messages from STAR to all fail site admin for attenttion.

---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS validation status (!RobQ)
   * Have updated validated page.  Still will address point about access points.

---++ LCG interoperability status (Burt)
   * No issues now relating to BDII
   * Tony's script that checks the web display from CEMon versus what comes from BDII
   * Could we use the lcg-sites-info? 
   * Once BDII was fixed, moved forward.  
   * Andreas may be installing worker node tarballs.
   * Site validation table up to date
      * 6 sites succeeeding - hellow world and srmcp
      * IUPUI - moving
      * UCSD - power outtage, gip patch applied?
      * LBL - site down
      * UC_ITB: configure gip advertises all the PBS queues advertised.  Not hackable... gums-host-cron resets this. 

---++ BDII Aggregator (Anand, Tim)
   * Was publishing stale information, affecting interoperability
   * BDII-update process was not running
   * Now working correctly - creating a document for Facilities group
   * Also working on an monitor for three processes
   * A couple of GIP related updates
 
---++ !ReSS validation status (Gabriele)
   * Rob, Alain, Gabriele, Suchandra met to discuss how to make sure  !ReSS information is accurate
   * Mechanism to check specific class ads - eg., number of nodes .ne. zero.
   * Defined centrally, with static attributes; evaluate with a condor status command to evaluate expressions
   * Basic ideas have been shown to work.  


---++ RSV validation status (Arvind)
   * Happy with version in VDT 1.8.1

---++ Documentation (Anne)
   * Documentation hub being reviewed and table re-organized
   * VDT team will begin to help starting next week

---++ Site Status Reports (Site Admins)
   * BNL - will update to ITB 0.7.1
   * FNAL - have already tried VTB based on 1.8.1;  will check carefully RSV.
   * UC - going to be updating to 0.7.1 - will be some downtime next week
   * CIT ITB - no report
   * CIT LIGO - problem with RSV probes; re-installing VDT 1.8.1/ITB 0.7.1
   * TTU  - no report
   * UCSD - no report
   * Purdue - no report


---++ Squid validation status
   * Carryover from last meeting: *OU will volunteer as a site for squid, will report next week*
Update as of 9/26/07: Squid validation exercise has been completed successfully from the ITB (OUHEP_ITB) server and the WNs. Squid was installed separately from the OSG-0.7.0 main installation and the server started. configure-osg.sh was ran and the details of squid provided. configure_squid failed complaining that the squid installation wasn't found under the main osg-0.7.0 installation. But strangely this didn't seem to affect squid in any way. Running configure-osg.sh updated the osg-attributes.conf file with the OSG_SQUID_LOCATION attribute. wget test was done on the server and it succeeded (MISS followed by a HIT). wget tests were also done by submitting jobs to the ITB cluster through globus-job-run (so that the job executes on a WN) and it did pass as expected (OSG_SQUID_LOCATION was understood and MISS was followed by a HIT). Feedback has been provided to Dave Dykstra about these tests and it has been concurred that the validation was successful. A GOC ticket has been opened (ticket number 4150?) for the configure-osg.sh issue as discussed above. Thanks to Dave, Steve & Horst for the help during the tests.

   * Problems when squid is installed outside of the OSG installation
   * Suchandra will address these before releasing ITB 0.7.1.


---++ AOB
   * Next week we will have an *OSG Sites Coordination meeting* in this timeslot (no ITB meeting)
