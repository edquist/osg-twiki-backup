---++ CEMon collector status, GIP validation via BDII (John R)
   * Has done some validation, both from the resource =ldiff= file and from the other side of CEMon consumer, shows information is getting passed incorrectly. Eg DNs missing, entire pieces of information missing.

   * Note - all this may involve configuration changes. 
   * Will provide update by noon tomorrow.
