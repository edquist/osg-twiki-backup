---++ Documentation
Ruth is asking for an overhaul of our current documentation:

<pre>
My concerns as I remember them are

a) Is any one responsible for taking information in tickets, mail lists, discussions 
which impact documentation and making sure the changes get made and reviewed?
b) Would we benefit from bringing in an expert outsider e.g. do you or Charles know 
if the people who do the Globus and/or TeraGrid technical pages are consultants, 
available for 3 months etc etc.
c) Are the Client and User pages equivalent in quality/scope to the Site Install and 
Administrators pages.
d) Is this a time/opportunity to really engage the education /training side and have 
more integrated information, cross linkages.
e) Operational Security hints/kinks/tools/help; leverage from EGEE isec information.
f) Do you have a specific request for additional/different effort needed from 
outside the existing team.
</pre>
