---++ This meeting
Purpose of this meeting is to coordinate project tasks within the Trash/Integration and Sites Coordination activities.

---++ From Jeff

- the gip testing seems ok however the validation process was broken e.g. web-pages and docs no longer work & Tony wasn't aware of their existence.  We're trying to recover.  One of my sites (LBNL_VTB) looks ok via the new validation scheme, the other is reporting mixed messages to CEmon vs BDII.  I expect to work with Tony tomorrow afternoon/Tuesday to isolate the problem.  Suchandra was going to do an install as well but I've not heard on that yet.

- I am ready to install new GUMS to run the new set of tests.  I figure I can get the first pass on the VTB done before EOB Wednesday assuming no big problems. I haven't heard whether it is in the VDT test cache yet.

As for some items on the Documentation part of the agenda: 
- It may be a good idea to have 1 person responsible for making doc changes and keeping an eye out on documentation problems.  That person would lead the doc discussion each meeting.  I would even volunteer for that job if you think it's useful.  I wouldn't volunteer (or be the right person) to manage an overhaul of the documentation.

- I think parts (c) & (d) on the list are related.  The Client docs seem ok to me and contain (links to) examples of using some of the client tools.  I also documented some specific tests to probe a CE/Site using a Client which I linked from the workshop pages. This may be generally useful as well.  However none of these are attempts to recreate common use cases in the OSG user community.  That may be useful to have - at least cross referenced in the client install guide.  Engage has some good resources on their web pages (and Mats offered me some more information).  I've not looked at the user group pages.

Also, along with the CEDPS work and SGE support, I've assumed you were aware that I have been taking on part of Doug's RA duties.  It's not a ton of work but it does take up a chunk of time every day.  I was hoping to be done with it by now but I haven't heard anything from Doug recently.

---++ Documentation
Ruth is asking for an overhaul of our current documentation:


<pre>
My concerns as I remember them are

a) Is any one responsible for taking information in tickets, mail lists, discussions 
which impact documentation and making sure the changes get made and reviewed?
b) Would we benefit from bringing in an expert outsider e.g. do you or Charles know 
if the people who do the Globus and/or TeraGrid technical pages are consultants, 
available for 3 months etc etc.
c) Are the Client and User pages equivalent in quality/scope to the Site Install and 
Administrators pages.
d) Is this a time/opportunity to really engage the education /training side and have 
more integrated information, cross linkages.
e) Operational Security hints/kinks/tools/help; leverage from EGEE isec information.
f) Do you have a specific request for additional/different effort needed from 
outside the existing team.
</pre>


   * a) Charles: Globus team - uses a feedback link and forms are used, sends to a mailing list. 
   * d) Charles: OSG EDU event in March, working w/ Alina. Release documentation is both a reference and "how-to".  Need to separate this out. 
   * c) Jeff will help
   * e) Rob will follow-up

---++ Sites not updating VO information (Suchandra)
   * vo-map.txt
   * vo members in GUM
   * We need a clear statement about what to do.
