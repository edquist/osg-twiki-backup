---++Automated ITB Validation Page
   * Developed by Suchandra T.
   * http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/result-page.html
   * Observations noted: Managed-Fork is not yet a validated field. GridScan script can't parse new line and fails. John R. to investigate issue.
   * John W suggested that validation tests be added for GSIFTP and SRM services. Suchandra will add these items TO-DO list. 
   * BDII has been removed as a label from the column that was labeled BDII/GIP.  Column now reads GIP which is the component validated.
   * Suchandra noted that the information in the GIP and GROW fields are both validating the GIP. GROW folks should consider the redundancy.
   * The version column was not reporting the correct version of ITB_INSTALL_TEST2. Fixed by Suchandra.

---++ Gratia testbed in the ITB
   * the production server for OSG: http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/   
   * an identical server for the ITB: http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8881/gratia-reporting/
   * Phillipe C. reported that the Gratia team has fixed bugs in the RPMs and the script that patched condor.pm.
   * Probe was configured at LIGO-CIT-ITB this week with Phillipe's assistance.
   * Other probes on ITB installed and configured this week:
      * condor:citgrid3.cacr.caltech.edu

      * sge:pc1805.nersc.gov
   * VDT team has integrated latest bug fixes in VDT 1.6.0 cache to be released soon.

---++ State of the VDT report by Alain
   * VDT cache 1.6.0  almost code complete. Should be ok for limited testing on the VTB very soon. Alain will email to osg-itb when VDT 1.6.0 is ready for the VTB team.

---++Any Other Business
   * As people need access at NERSC for ITB/VTB work, there is a procedure for requesting accounts. Some OSG specific details are provided on the OSG Twiki:
      * http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/OSGResourceAllocations
      * In particular, one can request a PDSF account via a web-interface, http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/PDSF/starting/newuser_form.php on which you should select 'OSG' from the project (& hpss) options and include a comment that the account is for ITB/VTB work. (info from Jeff P.)
   * Horst pointed out there is an outstanding issue with using NFS-Lite with Condor in the standard universe. The OSG-Troubleshooting WG has not reported status on this issue.
