---+ ITB 0.5.2 Follow-up Meeting

---++ Attending
   * Suchandra, Rob G, Rob Q, Alain R, John W, Jeff, David, John R, Tanya

---++ Action items from the ITB install fest:

   * VirtualWorkshopJan07
   * CEMon issues
   * fetch_crl issue
  
---++ Worshop comments
   * Close to 25 people on the phone call - seemed to have gone well, successful.
   * 13 sites installed, with no major hiccups except the major issues discussed below.

---++ CEMon status
   * Sites keep failing - but we're not sure why they are failing.  With the exception of OU and Grow.
   * Have the out-of-memory errors; some have adjusted the heap-size parameter.
   * David reports that Tanya has begun looking at this as well, but is just beginning her studies.
   * Does not seem to depend on whether or not both subscriptions are on.
   * Didn't seem to come up during VTB testing since we were re-installing often.
   * John W notes that there is another jar file in the CEmon development area - has something changed?
   * Suchandra: uct3-edge6 has been running without an out-of-memory error.
   * Alain: lets ask people to collect:
      * when they started tomcat, when you started seeing errors (time-to-failure) 
      * mem size, config file - which subscriptions are active?
      * Platform information
      * New plugin jar file plugin for OSG (172 with patches was what was in VDT, a sensor in that version might be causing the problem).
   * Tanya - can reproduce the failure within 20 minutes.  Is looking at Jconsole to examine memory usage.
   * Tanya - are the 2 sites that are reporting continuously successfully - would like to know their configuration (OUHEP and GROW).
   * Alain will email her the contact info for OU and Grow.

---++ Gratia
   * Seems to be working at 90% of the sites, except TTU which is running PBS.  Probably not a Gratia problem.
   * Need to run the Gratia probe on a machine that has access to the PBS or LSF logfiles.  Similar to web services GRAM.  This is probably just a documentation issue.

---++ Globus PBS
   * Broken?  Alain: yes, but.  Problem is the very large environment that is being sent with the job.  TTU-specific?  Other sites?
   * Alain will follow-up with Alan on this.
  
---++ Gridex
   * Lots of failures.  Alain will follow-up with the UW team.

---++ Gridscan
   * Running site-verify every six hours, and it does save results of its tests.
   * Does no submissions to the job manager.

---++ BDII
   * Will require modifications to the BDII servers, the CEMon consumer process that sends to the email to the BDII server.
   * John will have an update on Thursday.
   * David raises the point that we need to validate this information.
