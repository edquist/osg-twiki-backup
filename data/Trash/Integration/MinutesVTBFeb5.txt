---++ OSG Logging Architecture  (Brian Tierney)

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG-logging.ppt][OSG-logging.ppt]]: slides on OSG Logging Architecture
      * concerns from sites about sending log data to OSG has led to modified scheme - See slide 4
      * proposed architecture provides remote query of log information held at site
      * Some Questions raised:
         * do we really need additional infrastructure to make logs remotely queryable?
         * does subset of info sent to GOC provide any value?
         * does it lower the bar for bringing problems to the troubleshooting operation?
         * Are there additions we've not thought of that could make it extremely useful?
         * Are multi-site investigations useful?
      * Brian will be scheduled to present ideas in a bigger forum which should include GOC and Trash/Troubleshooting team.  Likely Site-Admin section of the March all hands meeting
