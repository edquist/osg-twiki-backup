   * Previous meetings, MeetingMinutes 
   * OSG 0.8/ITB 0.7 background

---++ VTB/ITB site list 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ITBSitesList][ITB Sites List]]
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/ITBSitesList][VTB Sites List]]

---++ VDT Update 
   * 1.10.0 release made yesterday
   * ITB branch available as ITB:ce-0.9.0
  
 
---++ Configure-osg (Suchandra)
   * Available in ITB branch
   * Email will go out to email list with instructions on use

---++ Validation 
   * RSV [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB090/InstallAndConfigureRSV][Instructions to test RSV from VDT 1.10.0 are here]]
   * Gratia
      * Probes
         * Probes not in final form, waiting for new collector to release probes
         * New principal feature is probes being able to collect FQAN for most jobs (except for some ws-gram jobs)
         * Nothing new needed to validate probes
      * Collector 
         * Existing databases will be upgraded in order to handle FQANs
         * Will affect people with gratia databases
         * Testing will consist of upgrading collector and then checking to make sure that the collector is collecting information
         * More data integrity and speed should result from a switch to innodb 
      * Site level collector
         * Only instructions for this are found on gratia fnal collector [[http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration/replication-howto.html][here]]
         * Chris will review this to make sure instructions are still up to date
         * A few replication bugs that affects robustness but bugs should be fixed in next release
         * Known problems if replicatee is down (e.g. if fermilab site is down, site level collector might not work)
         * Unknown whether probe setup will get updated if configure-osg is rerun at a later date (i.e. probes may reset to reporting to fnal and not the local site collector)
         * Updating an existing collector may take a while if existing data is present in a local site collector (check logs if collector takes a while to come back up)
   * Cemon
      * After installing cemon, check to see that cemon is reporting to itb ress page
      * Can check the ReSS homepage for exact commands
      * Tanya will update troubleshooting
      * Admins should check the information being reported to make sure things make sense if the information is being reported to cemon
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection][Resource Selection Homepage]]
      * Problems in cemon might be in gip configuration problems
         * Tanya has made scripts available that can distinguish between gip and cemon issues
         * gip glue checker also [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/InformationServices/GipTesting][available]]
