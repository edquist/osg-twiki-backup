---++ Introduction
NDT, OWAMP, BWCTL and NPAD are a set of tools provided by Internet2 and packaged and distributed by VDT.
They interact with the Network Performance Toolkit that has been installed on dedicated machines on OSG Sites.

---++ Installation
All these tools are included in [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][Osg Client]] (see its documentation for installation and setup).
You may install these utilities separately with Pacman as well. The commands are respectively:
<pre>
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:NDT
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:OWAMP
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:BWCTL
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:NPAD-Client
</pre>

---++ On Demand Testing
OSG VO’s have a need to monitor site-to-site network paths to ensure these paths remain operational.  They also have a need to troubleshoot performance problems quickly and efficiently.  The perfSONAR-based tools and services are designed to support these dual tasks.  Using a bootable CD, the server tools needed to perform the monitoring tasks can be easily brought-up by the VO site admin.  These servers also support several advanced diagnostic tools to assist in the on-demand troubleshooting process.  Finally, the client tools needed to troubleshoot a CE or SE are deployed via the VDT, making it possible to quickly resolve performance problems from any node in a VO’s cluster.


Installation:
A suite of client tools that can be used to measure and troubleshoot problems from any CE or SE has been installed via the base VDT package.  These tools support delay measurements (OWAMP), throughput measurements (BWCTL), and advanced diagnostics (NDT and NPAD).  The command syntax for each tool is described in the next section.

Each of the client tools listed above communicates with a companion server process to perform a measurement/test.  To simplify the deployment of these individual tool servers, a bootable ISO image (Performance Toolkit) has been made available.  Once this ISO image has been downloaded and burned onto a CD, the CD can be used to boot a hardware platform (PC, 1U server) starting the required tool server processes.

The server tools are also available as source packages in tar format and as rpm based installation packages.  See <perfsonar URL> for details.  The rest of this section assumes the reader has installed the server tools using the ISO image based Performance Toolkit.

Once the Toolkit server has booted you may begin on-demand testing.  The server tools will use a generic set of configuration files.  The intent is to make it easy to stand up a temporary server when and where it is needed.  However, it is expected that a permanently installed server will be customized/configured allowing it to support both on-demand testing and regularly scheduled monitoring.  See <prefSONAR URL> for step-by-step instructions on how to complete the customization process.


On Demand Testing:
The VDT package includes the client tool needed to perform on-demand testing and troubleshooting from any CE or SE.   This suite of tools allow one-way delay measurements, iperf based throughput measurements, and advanced diagnostic measurements. 
(the tag <output> below will be replaced by the appropriate screen shots in some picture/pdf format)

---+++ NDT         
The Network Diagnostic Tool (NDT) runs a series of short tests to determine what the current performance is and what, if anything, is limiting that performance.  It can distinguish between host configuration and network infrastructure problems.  To diagnose the CE/SE configuration and network connection run the command 

=web100clt –n server.some.osg.domain=

which produces this <output>.  More details can be obtained by adding the “-l or –ll” option

=web100clt –l –n server.some.osg.domain=

which produces this <output>
 

=web100clt -n server.remote.domain=


---+++ OWAMP
The One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) is an advanced version of the common ping utility.  The OWAMP client (owping) communicates with an OWAMP server and measures the delay in each direction using NTP based time stamps.  OWAMP can be used to identify delay, loss, and packet reordering problems inside the network.  To measure the delay between the CE/SE and the remote server use the command 

=owping server.some.osg.doamin=

 which produces this <output>.  
  
=owping server.remote.domain=


---+++ BWCTL
The Bandwidth Control tool (BWCTL) is a wrapper for the iperf tool.  BWCTL improves the usability of iperf, removing the common problems of (1) needing remote access to a remote host and (2) security concerns about leaving an iperf daemon running on some host.  BWCTL supports testing in either direction, or between 2 remote BWCTL servers from a third location.  To measure the current throughput from your SE/CE to the remote server use the command 

=bwctl –s server.some.osg.domain=

which produces this <output>.   Third party tests, between 2 remote BWCTL servers will let you measure various sections of the end-2-end path, running 

=bwctl –c server1.some.osg.domain –s server2.some.other.domain=

will produce this <output>.

=bwctl [-s|-c] server.remote.domain=


---+++ NPAD      
The Network Path and Application Diagnosis (NPAD) tool examines a host and it’s local network infrastructure to determine what problems, if any, would hinder wide area performance.  Issues such as small TCP buffers in switches and routers are detected as well as common host configuration errors.   To determine if the CE/SE will achieve maximum performance over a WAN path run the command 

=diag-client server.this.osg.domain 8001 800 50=

which produces this <output>.  Note that the last 2 parameters are the speed and delay values you need to achieve.  (need better description of NPAD parameters?) Note2: diag-client commands return a partial URL, enabling easy sharing of results between users and site administrators.  To view the results prepend the Toolkit servers name/port to the returned string.  The example above would result in this URL http://server.this.osg.domain:8002/[returned_ServerData_string

=diag-client server.remote.domain port [rtt] [rate]=

---++ Scheduled Monitoring
In addition to the above on-demand tests, the Performance Toolkit server can be configured to continuously monitor the throughput or delay between your site and peer sites of interest.  To begin this monitoring enter the GUI <see step-by-step instructions> and ensure that your server is a member of the community(ies) of interest.  Once that is complete, continue on by selecting either the perfSONAR-BUOY throughput or delay configuration menu item.  

pSB-throughput:  This utility will run regularly scheduled BWCTL tests between your Toolkit server and the selected peer servers.  Results are stored in a database and displayed on the servers web page.  You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers.  This would allow monitoring of a common core infrastructure at a central site, while each site could keep local/customized views.  An example output is found <here>.
  
pSB-delay: This utility will run regularly scheduled OWAMP test between your Toolkit server and the selected peers.  Results are stored in a database and displayed on the server’s web page.  You may also use standard web-service calls to retrieve this data for display on remote web servers.  This would allow monitoring of a common core infrastructure at a central site, while each site could keep local/customized views as required.  An example output is found <here>  (see OWAMP above to interpret the test results)


Known issues:
Both the NDT and NPAD servers also provide access via a web browser.  Simply point the browser at the appropriate port on the server and follow the on-screen instructions to run a test.

Finding servers with which to run on-demand tests can be a major impediment to effectively using these tools.  The perfSONAR project tackles this problem by running a registration service for participating tools.  The Performance Node ISO automatically uses this Lookup Service to advertise the tools existence.  You may retrieve a list of BWCTL, NDT, NPAD, and OWAMP servers by looking at the <url> page.  You can also create custom views by making web-service calls to retrieve the data of interest.  See the perfSONAR page for more details.
