---++ Maintain up-to-date Trusted CA information
The Trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, and their associated Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), are used for every transaction on a resource that establishes an authenticated network connection based on end user's certificate. In order for the authentication to succeed, the user's certificate must have been issued by one of the CAs in the Trusted CA directory, and the user's certificate must not be listed in the CRL for that CA. CRLs can be thought of as a black list of certificates. CAs are the trust authorities, similar to DMV that issues you the driving license.  (Another way of thinking CRLs is the do-not-fly lists at the airports. if your certificate shows up in CRLs, you are not allowed access.) This is handled at the certificate validation stage even before the authorization check (which will provide the mapping of an authenticated user to a local account UID/GID). So you do not need to do worry about it; the grid software will do this for you. However, you should worry about whether your site have a fresh list of Trusted CAs. There are multiple trust authorities in OSG (think of it as a different DMV for each state). If you do not have a up-to-date list of CAs, it is possible that all transactions with your site will start to fail.

There are two services that should be running in order to keep the CA certificate information current, *vdt-update-certs* and *fetch-crl*. There is a tool called *vdt-ca-manage* which can turn on these processes and has many other useful features, such as specifying where the Trusted CA certificates are to be stored on your machine. A complete documentation of vdt-ca-manage command can be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/VDTCAManage][here]].

The example below shows the use of *vdt-ca-manage* and turning on the *vdt-update-certs* and *fetch-crl* services for an installation of the OSG 1.2 client package. 

<verbatim>
OSG Client 1.2 install

# cd /opt/pacman
# wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.28.tar.gz

# tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.28.tar.gz

# cd pacman-3.28
# . ./setup.sh
# cd /opt
# mkdir osg-client-1.2
# cd osg-client-1.2/

# pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.



========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.


The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.


The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2.0 has been installed.

# . ./setup.sh

# vdt-ca-manage --help setupca
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location [root|local|<PATH>] --url [vdt|osg|<URL>]
  Location:
    root  - install into /etc/grid-security
    local - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share
    PATH  - install into PATH (e.g. /nfs/certificates)

  URL:
    vdt - use the VDT convenience distribution
    osg - use the OSG GOC distribution
    URL - use the distribution at URL (e.g. http://your.site.edu/ca-certificates-manifest-file)


# vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg

Notice that the example ends with displaying the current version of the CA certificate package. You can compare
this version with the distribution point at http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ to see if they are the same,
in which case you have the most recent version.
