There are significant changes from RSV 3.3.X (the last release in Pacman) to RSV 4.X.  Here are the highlights:

   * Jobs are now submitted to remote CEs using Condor-G instead of =globus-job-run=.  
      * We can monitor future CREAM CEs more seamlessly
      * RSV jobs will take longer to run as a result of using Condor-G
      * You can turn this behavior off by setting "use-condor-g = False" in =/etc/rsv/rsv.ini=

   * Probe re-writes
