---++ Summary
 *OSG %OSG_VERSION%* is based on *VDT %VDT_VERSION%* which contains several new features and bug-fixes from previous versions. For a comprehensive list of changes see:

   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.0/release.html.][VDT Version 1.10.0 release notes]] 
   * [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/%VDT_VERSION%/release.html.][VDT Version %VDT_VERSION% release notes]] 

We recommend that all resources and clients upgrade to OSG 1.0.

%ICON{warning}% *IMPORTANT* Please note that this will require a fresh, empty, installation: you cannot use =pacman -update=, <br /> nor can you use =pacman -update= in an existing installation. We do not know of any incompatibilities with OSG 0.8.0 clients and OSG 1.0 installations. Please let us know if you encounter any.

---++ Highlights going from OSG 0.8.0 to OSG 1.0
   * The VDT package no longer includes an aged version of !OpenSSL. The installation will now rely on the system's version of !OpenSSL. This puts the responsibility for security updates to !OpenSSL in the capable hands of your OS vendor. 
   * LCG-Utils has been added to the VDT, and in OSG it appears in the worker-node client package. LCG-Utils is a collection of tools developed by LCG to access storage elements efficiently. 
   * The Gratia probes are now much more reliable, and there it can now collect information from dCache. Support for a local Gratia repository has also been significantly improved. 
   * The Generic Information Provider (which collects information about your site) has been greatly improved. 
   * There is a major new version of the Resource & Service Validation (RSV) package. In particular, there are new SE probes, and it now uses a minimal subset of Condor to run the probes, called Condor Cron. 
   * glexec has been updated 
   * [[Bestman]] updates 
   * Operational tools to help administrators of storage resources. 
   * Updated version of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-Admin 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Client updates - correct exit status return codes. 
   * New names for SRM v2 clients in two flavors, LBNL and Fermi. Support for opportunistic use of storage using SRM V2 interface. 
   * Several Globus patches, including one to allow globus-url-copy to work with !GridFTP v2 servers. 
   * Several CEMon upgrades resulting from experiences in OSG 0.8. 
   * An [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/lotman.html][experimental version of !GridFTP]] that supports quotas for users. 
   * The VDT now supports Debian 4 (x86 and x86-64) and SLES 9 (x86-64 only) 
   * The process to install CA certificates has been updated. The process is also more transparent: try the =vdt-ca-certs-status= command.
