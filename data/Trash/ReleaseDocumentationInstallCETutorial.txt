---++ Introduction
These instructions assume that the CE software is being installed on a new installation of 32 bit installation of a RHEL 5.x based system (e.g. Scientific Linux, Centos, etc.). After following these instructions, you should have a complete and functional CE installation.  

---++ Prerequisites
You'll need the following before the CE installation is started. 
   * RHEL 5.x based system
   * Working job manager (e.g. Condor)
   * Working GUMS installation
   * Working pacman installation in =/opt/pacman=

---++ Installation
---+++ Creating Directories and Installing Certificates
The first thing to create are the directories that will be used for the installation and ancillary files.  These directories are 
   * =/opt/ce-1.2= (for the CE installation)
   * =/etc/grid-security= (for the host and service certificates)
To create these directories, the following directories will need to be created:
   * =mkdir -p /opt/ce-1.2=
   * =chmod 755 /opt/ce-1.2=
   * =mkdir /etc/grid-security=
   * =chmod 755 /etc/grid-security=
   * =mkdir /etc/grid-security/http=
   * =chmod 755 /etc/grid-security/http=

Next, the host and security certificates will need to be placed in the proper places in =/etc/grid-security=.  These instructions assume that the following files are in the current directory
   * =hostcert.pem= - host certificate file
   * =hostkey.pem= - host key file
   * =httpcert.pem= - http service certificate file
   * =httpkey.pem= - http service key file
   * =rsvcert.pem= - rsv service certificate file
   * =rsvkey.pem= - rsv service key file
These files will need to be placed in the correct locations.  The following commands will do this:
   * =cp hostcert.pem /etc/grid-security/=
   * =cp hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/=
   * =cp httpcert.pem /etc/grid-security/http=   
   * =cp httpkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http=   
   * =cp rsvcert.pem /etc/grid-security=   
   * =cp rsvkey.pem /etc/grid-security=   

   * Here is a recent tutorial module: ComputingElementHandsOn
   * There are differences are some exceptions:
      * The Grid Colombia cache will be used
      * The configuration file will be different, so as to point to the GC !ReSS server.
