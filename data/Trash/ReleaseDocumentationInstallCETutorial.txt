---++ Introduction
These instructions assume that the CE software is being installed on a new installation of 32 bit installation of a RHEL 5.x based system (e.g. Scientific Linux, Centos, etc.). After following these instructions, you should have a complete and functional CE installation.  

---++ Prerequisites
You'll need the following before the CE installation is started. 
   * RHEL 5.x based system
   * Working job manager (e.g. Condor)
   * Host / Service certificates:
      * A host certificate for the server
      * A http certificate for the server
      * A rsv certificate for the server
   * Working GUMS installation
   * Working pacman installation in =/opt/pacman=

---++ Installation
---+++ Preliminaries
The first thing to create are the directories that will be used for the installation and ancillary files.  These directories are 
   * =/opt/ce-1.2= (for the CE installation)
   * =/etc/grid-security= (for the host and service certificates)
To create these directories, the following directories will need to be created:
   * =mkdir -p /opt/ce-1.2=
   * =chmod 755 /opt/ce-1.2=
   * =mkdir /etc/grid-security=
   * =chmod 755 /etc/grid-security=
   * =mkdir /etc/grid-security/http=
   * =chmod 755 /etc/grid-security/http=

Next, the host and security certificates will need to be placed in the proper plac

   * Here is a recent tutorial module: ComputingElementHandsOn
   * There are differences are some exceptions:
      * The Grid Colombia cache will be used
      * The configuration file will be different, so as to point to the GC !ReSS server.
