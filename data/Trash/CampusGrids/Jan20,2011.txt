---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg Thain (U Wisc), Steve Cox (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Brian Bockelman (UNL), Horst Severini (OU), Dan Bradley (U WIsc), Joel Snow (LU), Dick Greenwood (!LaTech), Michael Bryant (!LaTech), Ben Cotton (Purdue), Michael Moore (Clemson), Justin Ross (SMU),  (Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * HTPC is now working on a testbed at SMU. Justin ran a combination of HTPC and regular HTC jobs on the cluster, observed jobs draining and filling and is now comfortable with enabling HTPC on his production cluster. Once configured he will allow Glow, Engage, and HCC VOs to submit jobs to this cluster. 
   * Philippe has completed the HTPC accounting probe for Gratia and will pass it to the integration team for inclusion into the VDT. The LSF component is still a bit clumsy since there does not appear to be an easy way to find jobs that utilize the whole node as discussed previously, but this will work. 
   * Once the accounting probe becomes available, Condor 7.5+ will be required to take advantage of the Condor probe whereas the Condor setup for running HPTC jobs only requires Condor 7.4+. (Dan B.)
   * CMS and Atlas will over the next several months start submitting HTPC jobs.  An important step in helping Tier1's and Tier2's is to start using HTPC is to include the option in the CE Install and User Docs. Following up with Robert E. on the best way to start this process. (Dan)
   * Hardware has been allocated for an HTPC submit host at U Wisc and should arrive in the next week or two. This submit host will be used as the model for submitting HTPC jobs and will be used by Greg to manage his HTPC submissions. 
   * HTPC user candidates:
      * Brenda Temple (Molecular Dynamics) at UNC is now able to submit jobs to multiple sites using OSGMM. Not sure exactly how many jobs she plans to submit in the near future.
      * Steve is working on integrating Laura I.'s (MD) application into OSGMM. 
   * LaTech folks Dick and Michael joined the call today and expressed their interest in setting up a campus grid to distribute jobs across different clusters on their campus. Tier-3 hardware has arrived but has not been set up yet. They were encouraged to try using the campus factory model for job submissions that will enable them to expand job submission to multiple clusters. 
   * Steve was having some difficulties in installing the Campus Factory software. Derek to help him debug. 
   * Nebraska was flocking ~5000 sustained jobs to Purdue over the weekend.
   * CG software is now leveraging libraries from !GlideinWMS. 
   * Next step in development of the CG is to integrate a Gratia probe on the Condor startD.
