---++ Pre-Requisites
The campus grid requires [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl?state=select_from_mirror_page&version=7.5.3&mirror=UW%20Madison&optional_organization_url=http://][Condor-7.5.3]].  

#InstallingCondor
---+++  Installing Condor 

You do not have to install condor as root.  This guide will assume installing as non-root.  The user that runs condor will be the same user which the pilots will be submitted as to PBS.
   1. [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/downloads-v2/download.pl?state=select_from_mirror_page&version=7.5.3&mirror=UW%20Madison&optional_organization_url=http://][Download]]
   1. Uncompress condor.  For example if you are running on RHEL5, SL5, or !CentOS5:
   <pre class="screen">tar xzf condor-7.5.3-linux-x86_64-rhel5-dynamic.tar.gz</pre>
   1. Create the file =condor.sh= with the following, replacing =CONDOR_LOCATION= with the full path to condor-7.5.3.  It should include the condor-7.5.3.
   <pre class="file">#!/bin/sh
CONDOR_DIR=CONDOR_LOCATION
export CONDOR_CONFIG=$CONDOR_DIR/etc/condor_config
export PATH=$CONDOR_DIR/bin:$CONDOR_DIR/sbin:$PATH
</pre>


---++ Preparing Condor
   1. Download the factory release.
   1. Execute the condor 7.5.3 patch:
   <pre class="screen">$ cd condor-7.5.3
$ patch -p1 < FACTORY_RELEASE/share/condor/condor-7.5.3-glite.patch </pre>
   1. Copy the file =condor_config.generic= from =CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/examples/condor_config.generic=:
   <pre class="screen">$ cp etc/examples/condor_config.generic etc/condor_config </pre>
   1. Edit the required lines in the condor_config that you just created.
      * =RELEASE_DIR= to the full path of the condor location.  It should be the same as =CONDOR_LOCATION= mentioned in [[#InstallingCondor][Installing Condor]]
      * =LOCAL_DIR= to a directory where condor will place host dependent files (logs...).  A common value is =$(RELEASE_DIR)/local.$(HOSTNAME)=.  Be sure to create this directory.  =$(HOSTNAME)= is same as the output from =hostname= on the command line.
      * =LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE= set to =$(RELEASE_DIR)/etc/condor_config.local=

   1. Edit the required condor lines in the local condor configuration file (condor_config.local):
      * =CONDOR_HOST= to the full hostname of the machine that will run condor
      * =CONDOR_ADMIN= set to the email address that will receive emails about malfunctioning condor.
      * =UID_DOMAIN= set to a unique name for this resource.  For example, for a cluster named Firefly at Nebraska, we would set =UID_DOMAIN= to =firefly.unl.edu=
      * =FILESYSTEM_DOMAIN= set to your domain.  This can be the same as =UID_DOMAIN=
      * =COLLECTOR_NAME= Name of the resource.
      * =FLOCK_FROM= Hosts that will be allowed to run jobs on this cluster
      * =FLOCK_TO= Hosts that can run jobs submitted on this cluster.
      * =INTERNAL_IPS= IP addresses (or hostnames) of the worker nodes and any NAT machines that the worker nodes may use to contact the =CONDOR_HOST=.
      
   1. Edit the Condor PBS Blahp configuration.  This file is located in =CONDOR_LOCATION/lib/glite/etc/batch_gahp.config=
      * =pbs_binpath= set to the location of the pbs executables (ie qstat, qsub, ...)
      * =pbs_nochecksubmission= Set to =yes=
      * =pbs_nologaccess= Set to =yes=
      * =blah_shared_directories= set to =/dev/null=

   A sample configuration with the variables changes is shown below.

Start the condor daemons by first sourcing the condor.sh file you created above:
<pre class="screen">$ . CONDOR_LOCATION/condor.sh</pre>

Then starting the =condor_master=:
<pre class="screen">$ condor_master</pre>

---++ Installing the factory
In this section, the location of the factory will be represented by =FACTORY_LOCATION=.

---+++ Configuring
In the configuration file =FACTORY_LOCATION/etc/campus_factory.conf=:
   * =MaxIdleGlideins= Set to the number of startd that can be idle at a time
   * =iterationtime= Seconds to sleep between iterations of checking for idle jobs.  30 Seconds is a good default.
   * =maxqueuedjobs= Number of glidein jobs that can be queued but idle.  When running, these will turn in to idle startd's
   * =worker_tmp= The local temp directory on the worker node.  This will be where condor places the intermediate job data and glidein logs
   * =GLIDEIN_Site= (Optional)  Distinct name that the startd's will advertise when jobs are running.  This is useful for accounting, if you want to distinguish what cluster you are running on.  Defaults to the COLLECTOR_NAME defined in the condor_config.local above.
   * =loglevel= Level of logging that is enabled for the factory.  As this is an early release, I would recommend =debug=.  The logs are rotated and eventually deleted automatically.
   * =logdirectory= Directory to place the logs for the factory.  They will be named campus_factory.log

---+++ Starting the Factory
   1. Confirm that the condor executables are in your path:
   <pre class="screen">$ condor_q</pre>
   Should output
   <pre class="screen">
-- Schedd: HOSTNAME : <IP_ADDRESS>
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               

0 jobs; 0 idle, 0 running, 0 held
   </pre>
   If =condor_q= failes, be sure to source the condor.sh file you created while installing condor.
   <pre class="screen">$ . CONDOR_LOCATION/condor.sh</pre>
   1. Export the correct python path:
   <pre class="screen">$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:FACTORY_LOCATION/python-lib</pre>
   1. Start the factory:
   <pre class="screen">$ cd FACTORY_LOCATION
condor_submit share/factory.job
</pre>
