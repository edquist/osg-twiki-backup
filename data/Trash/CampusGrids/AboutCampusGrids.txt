---+ About the Campus Grids activity
The Campus Grids activity commenced in the 4th quarter of 2007. It is a crucial component of OSG to include US universities in the national cyberinfrastructure. 

---++ Goals

By helping campuses understand the value of campus grids and resource sharing through the OSG national framework, this initiative aims at democratizing cyberinfrastructure and providing access to our national scale resources to virtually all U.S. campus communities.

The OSG middleware and operational framework enables any site to participate as an OSG resource, provided it is a well maintained resource that users can count on. Technically there are no hurdles in having every US university and college contribute resources to OSG and use OSG resources in return. Several campuses have done so very well: Purdue University, University of Wisconsin- Madison and Clemson University. Several other universities participate in OSG through individual research groups. 

---++ Activities

We are currently reaching out to campuses throughout the US via the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][Campus Cyberinfrastructre Days]] program and through the Educause CI workshops. This outreach will lead to the selection of several campuses with which OSG will work closely in order to make their campus grid a reality and a valuable OSG partnership. 

We are in various stages of discussions with several campuses: LSU, UCSB, U Buffalo, U Albany, UNC Chapel Hill, Harvard, Iowa, UCLA, Lehigh and Ringling College. In addition to this initial outreach we are fine-tuning the Clemson campus grid setup to document a set of best practices, guidelines and stakeholder agreement examples.

A CI-TEAM proposal (Embedded Immersive Trash/Engagement for Cyberinfrastructure) was awarded by NSF to RENCI (PI: John !McGee) and Clemson (Co-PI: Sebastien Goasguen) in April 2008. The goal of this proposal is to embed OSG technical staff with users and campus IT staff to enable users to access and make effective use of OSG as well as help campuses to bring up CI resources on their own campus and potentially join OSG as an OSG site. This award follows in the general spirit of OSG which aims to engage all campuses throughout the nation to create a cohesive CI at the so called "Track 3" level.

We also regularly participate in the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][Campus CI Days]] effort along with several other national cyberinfrastructure providers.
