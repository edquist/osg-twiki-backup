---+ About the Campus Grids activity
The Campus Grids activity commenced in the 4th quarter of 2007. It is a crucial component of OSG to include US universities in the national cyberinfrastructure. 

---++ Goals

By helping campuses understand the value of campus grids and resource sharing through the OSG national framework, this initiative aims at democratizing cyberinfrastructure and providing access to our national scale resources to virtually all U.S. campus communities.

The OSG middleware and operational framework enables any site to participate as an OSG resource, provided it is a well maintained resource that users can count on. Technically there are no hurdles in having every US university and college contribute resources to OSG and use OSG resources in return. Several campuses have done so very well: Purdue University, University of Wisconsin- Madison and Clemson University. Several other universities participate in OSG through individual research groups. 

---++ Activities

We are currently reaching out to campuses throughout the US via the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][Campus Cyberinfrastructre Days]] program and through the Educause CI workshops. This outreach will lead to the selection of several campuses with which OSG will work closely in order to make their campus grid a reality and a valuable OSG partnership. 

We are in various stages of discussions with several campuses: LSU, UCSB, U Buffalo, U Albany, UNC Chapel Hill, Harvard, Iowa, UCLA, Lehigh and Ringling College. In addition to this initial outreach we are fine-tuning the Clemson campus grid setup to document a set of best practices, guidelines and stakeholder agreement examples.

A CI-TEAM proposal led by RENCI and with Clemson&#8217;s Goasguen as Co-PI has been submitted to NSF. We'd like to embed OSG technical staff with users and campus IT staff to enable users on OSG and to bring the OSG resource sharing framework to the campus.


We participate in the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][Campus CI Days]] effort along with several other national cyberinfrastructure providers.
