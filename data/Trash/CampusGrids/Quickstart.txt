---+ !SkeletonKey Quickstart

---++ Introduction
This page introduces the user to SkeletonKey and guides the user through installing the SkeletonKey software and setting up SkeletonKey up for initial use.  After completing the guide, the user should be able to install !SkeletonKey, start and stop the chirp server, and create a simple job to be run using Parrot and Chirp.

---++ Installation
!SkeletonKey uses a python script to install and set things up for you.  The installation procedure is as outlined below:

   1. First download the  SkeletonKey installer script <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% wget uc3-data.uchicago.edu/sk/install-skeleton-key.py
</pre>
   1. Pick a directory to install the CCTools and SkeletonKey binaries in (e.g. =bin= in your home directory).  Ideally this directory should be in your path.  <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% mkdir ~/bin
</pre>
   1. Pick a directory to export from Chirp (for now the tutorial will use /tmp)
   1. Run the installer, specifying the directory to install and the  directory to export from Chirp:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% python install-skeletonkey.py -b ~/bin -e /tmp
</pre>
