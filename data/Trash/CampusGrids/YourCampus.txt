---+ Get your campus involved

The Campus Grids activity in OSG works with the [[Trash/Trash/Engagement/WebHome][Engagement]] activity to extend the benefits of grid computing to new research communities.  In addition, OSG participates in the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Campus_Grids][Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Days]] effort that is focused on campuses.  

Peruse the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Campus_Grids][CI Days]] website to learn more about what is involved and how to get started. Feel free to contact Sebastien or John, as listed on [[Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/WebHome]], or one of the other CI Days participants. <!-- send email to _info at cidays dot org_ (when Russ gets it going)-->
