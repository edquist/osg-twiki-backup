-- Main.DanFraser - 25 Mar 2011
---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg Thain (U Wisc), Steven Cox (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Karthik Arunachalam (OU), Joel Snow (LU), , Michael Moore (Clemson), Preston Smith (Purdue), Rob Quick (Indiana), Marco Mambelli (UChicago), Steve Timm (FNAL), Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * We did meet last week although many folks were out for Spring Break. Notes from last week as well as this week are interspersed here:
   * We hosted Kim Dillman of TeraGrid at FNAL early this week. We discussed using an existing Glide-in submit host to submit jobs, although to get her started the Nebraska folks (Derek) kindly provided an account for her. She is very interested in submitting HTPC jobs. Specifically, Marco will be following up with her to help her get started.
   * Derek is working with Preston to set up a GLide-inWMS submit host at Purdue. Dan needs to follow up to see if this is a submit host that Kim could use.
   * Greg is setting up a basic job to test whether HTPC is working and will post this on the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/HighThroughputParallelComputing][HTPC Twiki]]. This is needed as HTPC is starting to be deployed on the OSG ITB sites and they are requesting a test case to verify that everything is working.
   * Dan to kick the tires again on the schema for HTPC & GPUs so that we can get this finalized and Burt can get started on implementing it.
   * Greg is also updating the OSG documentation for setting up HTPC as a basic part of a CE installation.
   * Dan is planning a trip to Virginia Tech in April. Greg sent a list of contacts that he is working with on HTPC. Marco may participate on this trip as well.
   * Derek reiterated that one of the problems with Campus grids is data movement. In their experiments, a Squid cache can be very beneficial. We discussed briefly whether this should be a standard part of a campus grid. No conclusion was reached, but we need to continue discussing. 
   * Steve is continuing to discuss workflows with the AMBER folks.
   * Steve is currently trying to set up a Campus grid between RENCI and UNC to connect to their GPU array.  (Derek is working with him as HTPC will need to be enabled as well to make this work as well.) They have discovered some glitches with using the BLAH/Condor/SGE combo. Derek to make his requests to the Condor/Blah team more visible by copying Miron. 
   * Dan B. and Derek to share info on how they submit both HTC and HTPC jobs from a single submit host.
   * Marco is working on the submit host documentation that needs to gather together some of the missing pieces required to make a coherent campus grid, especially when using a full Glide-inWMS submit host. 
   * Latech just received their Tier-3 hardware and are focusing on getting this set up and running. Configuring the campus grid is currently on hold for now. 
   * The AthenaMP folks are still trying to track down a strange seg-fault error that is occurring when they submit a parallel job. (Horst)
