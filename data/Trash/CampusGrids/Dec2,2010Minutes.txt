-- Main.DanFraser - 09 Dec 2010
---+++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/CampusGridMeetings
---+++ Attendees:
   * Derek Weitzel, David Swanson, Brian Bockelman, Ben Cotton,  Michael Moore, Joel Snow, Dan Fraser

---+++ Notes:
   * Everyone who attended the Campus Grid Workshop in Oct has now been added to the CC list. (Dan)
   * The Campus Grid Factory now has offline ads working. This capability is described in the link: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/viewauth/CampusGrids/OfflineClassAdFactory.
   * Michael M. and Ben C. have kindly agreed to download the Campus Grid Factory and test it on a small scale. There is no demand for production use at Clemson or Purdue since both already have functioning grids and the Factory is designed to help campuses that don't already have a grid set up. 
   * Joel noted that there is interest in submitting jobs between OU and Louisiana Tech, largely due to the Atlas Tier-3 at Louisiana. We'll discuss more on future calls. 
   * Derek was interested in getting more jobs from the Purdue campus running on PrairieFire. It looks like many of the jobs submitted from Purdue require either the Purdue File system or Windows. Need to work on identifying a few jobs that make good candidates for completing the testing between the two sites.
   * In follow up to the Campus Grids meeting held in Oct, Ben agreed to post a list of endpoints for flocking at Purdue.
