-- Main.DanFraser - 21 Apr 2011
---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg Thain (U Wisc), John !McGee (RENCI), Steven Cox (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Horst Severini (OU),  Joel Snow (LU), Scott Teige (Indiana), Marco Mambelli (UChicago), Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * Moving forward with this call it is important to capture the use cases and engagement experience that we are learning with Campus grids and also with HTPC users.
      * Derek has agreed to create a few slides and describe/discuss one model at Nebraska that uses an http cache for some applications.
      * Steve has agreed to describe the details he uses to get Molecular Dynamics codes running at Renci.
      * Greg has agreed to create a few slides describing how he engages and qualifies new users and then gets his users running.
      * Another important use case is the squid caching use case being used at Nebraska and being worked on at UWisc. 
      * Derek will present his slides next week.
   * Virginia Tech is now running the Campus Grid infrastructure on two clusters.
      * Derek is following up on one issue involving the "blah" interaction with PBS where the blah loses track of a job and reports it as lost; Condor then labels the job as being on "hold". Derek is looking at making a tweak to the Blah. 
   * Marco and Derek have been updating the Campus Grid documentation: it is now in the OSG documentation format and the installation has been expanded to include Condor setup and configuration. Also a few corrections/tweaks were made based on lessons learned from the VT install last week.
   * Steve working with Amber 9 users, they are very interested in finding more GPU resources. Are there other GPU resources down the pipe for OSG?
   * RENCI is installing a GlideinWMS front end and will be converting users to that.
   * Security setup is important when campus grids bridge from LAN to WAN, and it is important to use secure channels for daemon communication between Condors (e.g. shared secret, or SSL). Failure to do this could result in logins or grid proxies being compromised in sites that use the same submit host for OSG and campus submissions. This needs to be added to the documentation. 
   * Scott updating the version of Condor on their cluster.
   * Greg is debugging squid errors. Derek noted that CURL automatically sets the "no-cache" flag and this could be the source of some of their errors. 
   * Horst noted that they will be working on some codes that don't have seg fault problems. Hope to have some progress soon.
