---+ Introduction 

BOSCO (BLAHP Over Ssh Condor Overlay) is a job submission manager designed to help researchers manage large numbers (~1000s) of job submissions to 
the different resources that they can access on a campus (initially a PBS cluster running Linux).

It offers the following capabilities: 
   * Job submissions are automatically resubmitted when they fail. The researcher does not need to    baby sit their jobs                                                                                       
   * Job submissions can be throttled to meet batch scheduler settings (e.g. only 10 jobs running     concurrently). The researcher does not need to make multiple submissions. BOSCO handles that for them.    
   * BOSCO is designed to be flexible and will in the next version (v1) allow jobs to be submitted    to multiple clusters, perhaps with different job schedulers (e.g. PSS, LSF). The primary advantage for    
the researcher is that they only need to learn one job scheduler environment even if the clusters         utilize different native environments.                                                                    


<!--
Design goal is to manage 1000 jobs against a batch system that can only support 100 jobs running at a time
   * Universal front-end makes it easy to manage multiple job submissions 
   * Enables jobs to be submitted independent of remote batch queue size
   * We will help a researcher take a submit file from PBS and turn it into a Bosco submit file. Help will be in the form of documentation with sample files (e.g. maybe how to run R jobs or other common applications such as GROMACS) as well as hands on support when needed.
-->

More in detail the initial feature set is:
   * Simple installation and configuration via separate package and bosco_* command wrappers.
   * The installation can be on a user’s desktop or on another machine that they log into.
   * The package physically resides in the OSG VDT
   * Installs in user’s home directory
   * Does not require root access for installation or configuration
   * Submit node job queue size independent from remote batch queue size
   * Rebooting submit machine will not impact queued jobs
   * User can obtain some information about job positions in the batch queue
   * Package available as simple web-based download
And the current limitations:
   * Bosco package must be staged on submit node before installing
   * Submit node and cluster head node must be same HW/OS architecture and version.
   * No file I/O is provided between submit node and cluster head node – executable and data must be staged in and out manually

---+ Requirements
   $ *Submit-node*: Any PBS and Condor supported Linux platform
   $ *Cluster head-node*: Any PBS and Condor supported Linux platform
   $ *Condor version*: 7.7.6+
   $ *PBS flavors*: Torque and PBSPro


---+ Installation Procedure

   1. Download BOSCO 
      * [[ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/temporary/bosco/2012-02-20/condor-7.7.6-UW_development-rhel5.7-stripped.tar.gz][right click here and select "save as" and save it in your home directory]]
      * Else you can use =wget=:<pre class="screen">
wget ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/temporary/bosco/2012-02-20/condor-7.7.6-UW_development-rhel5.7-stripped.tar.gz
</pre>
   1. Unpack the tar file and Install BOSCO: <pre class="screen">
cd ~
mkdir tmp-install
cd tmp-install
tar xvzf ~/condor-7.7.6-UW_development-rhel5.7-stripped.tar.gz
cd condor-7.7.6-UW_development-rhel5.7-stripped/
mkdir man
bosco_install
</pre>

Now BOSCO is installed. To use it:
   1. Add all the desired clusters (at least one)
   1. Start BOSCO
   1. Submit a test job

---++ Add a cluster to BOSCO
To add a new cluster to the resources you will be using through BOSCO:
   1. Setup the environment appropriate for your shell (if you did not already): <pre class="screen">
cd ~
source bosco/bosco.[csh|sh]
</pre>
   1. For the cluster %RED%mycluster%ENDCOLOR% with submit host %RED%mycluster-submit.mydomain%ENDCOLOR% (FQDN) and queue managet %RED%PBS%ENDCOLOR%. Replace the parts in red: <pre class="screen">
bosco_cluster --add %RED%mycluster-submit.mydomain%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

You can see a list of the current clusters in BOSCO by typing:<pre class="screen">
bosco_cluster --list
</pre>

---+ Setup
Since BOSCO is not installed in the system path. An environment file must be sourced all the times you use BOSCO (start/stop/job submission or query, anything):<pre class="screen">
source ~/bosco/bosco.[csh|sh]
</pre>

---+ Services 
BOSCO has some persistent services that must be running. You'll have to start it at the beginning and probably after each reboot of your host.
You should stop BOSCO before an upgrade and possibly before a shutdown of your host.
If you will not use BOSCO anymore, uninstall will remove it from your system.

To start BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
bosco_start
</pre>

To stop BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
bosco_stop
</pre>

To uninstall BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
bosco_uninstall
</pre>

Manually transfer output data from batch system.


---+ Troubleshooting


---++ Useful Configuration and Log Files
BOSCO underneath is using Condor. You can find all the Condor log files in =~/bosco/local.HOSTNAME/log=

---++ Known Issues

The current version is not supporting file transfer. Not even stdout and stderr. If you specify them in the Condor submit file (to something different from /dev/null) your job will fail.
