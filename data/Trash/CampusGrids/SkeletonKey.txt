---+ Using Skeleton Key to remotely access data


---++ Introduction

Skeleton Key is a script that allows users to simplify the process of enabling remote access to data and applications through [[http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/software/chirp/][Chirp]] and [[http://www.nd.edu/~ccl/software/parrot/][Parrot]]. When Skeleton Key is invoked, it reads information from a configuration file on what data needs to be made available and how, and then generates a shell script that when run executes your application in an environment where it can access remote data and applications as if they where mounted locally.&nbsp;
