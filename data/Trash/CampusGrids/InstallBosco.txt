Services brief description

---++ Starting and Enabling Services
%STARTSECTION{"StartVOMSServices"}%
To start VOMS you need to start several services:
   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStart"}%
   1. Start voms server<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service voms start
</pre>
%ENDSECTION{"StartVOMSServices"}%

You should also enable the appropriate services so that they are automatically started when your system is powered on: 
   * %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlEnable"}%
   * To enable the other services: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig voms on
</pre>

---++ Stopping and Disabling Services
%STARTSECTION{"StopVOMSServices"}%
To stop VOMS you need to stop voms,... , and also the services they use if nothing else is using them:
   1. Stop voms server<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% service voms stop
</pre>
   1. %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlStop"}%
%ENDSECTION{"StopVOMSServices"}%

In addition, you can disable services by running the following commands.  However, you don't need to do this normally.
   * %INCLUDE{"InstallCertAuth" section="OSGBriefFetchCrlDisable"}%
   * To disable the other services: <pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /sbin/chkconfig voms off
</pre>

---+ Validation of Service Operation 



---+ Troubleshooting


---++ Useful Configuration and Log Files
In the troubleshooting section of each Install Document, the file locations should be specified as follows:
| *Service/Process* | *Configuration File* | *Description* |
| Service1 | /etc/Service1.cfg | Configuration information for this service |
| Service2 | /etc/Service2.cfg | Configuration information for this service |
