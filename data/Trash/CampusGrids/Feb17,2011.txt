-- Main.DanFraser - 17 Feb 2011
---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg Thain (U Wisc), Steven Cox (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Dan Bradley (U WIsc), Joel Snow (LU), Dick Greenwood (!LaTech), David Swanson (UNL), Ben Cotton (Purdue), Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * Greg starting to use the HTPC front end at UWisc for glide-in HTPC jobs. Has transitioned one user, now transitioning the second user. 
      * One issue: there is currently no visibility to see what sites are running the HTPC jobs.
      * Derek noted that he has a monitoring capability based on (Condor -q) that does this and will send out the info to the group. 
   * Dan/Greg to attend next OSG documentation meeting for inclusion of HTPC paradigm.
   * Justin added the SMU HTPC coordinates to the HTPC document.
   * Steve needs more capability for his HTPC MD users (using Amber 9/10 with plans to upgrade to Amber 11). 
      * Dan suggested adding SMU to his list. This should be available to the Engage VO. 
      * Ben C. has agreed to look into adding the Engage VO to the HTPC list. 
   * Steve noted that he is currently using GPUs via HTPC using a special RSL.
   * Dan F. suggested that we look into updating the schema to accommodate GPUs in a similar manner to HTPC. We can discuss with Burt next week.
   * Horst was attending a call on athenaMP. We look forward to your update next week.
   * HCC used over 388K hours at Purdue over 9 days using flocking -- this is equivalent to ~1800 sustained cores for 9 days. Peak number of jobs was as high as 7K.
