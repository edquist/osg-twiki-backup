---+++ Notes:
   * As one followup from SC meetings last week, Don Holmquist started working with Steve Timm to create a small cluster of GPUs that can be accessed on the OSG.
   * As we started ramping up a new HTPC user last week, we discovered that HTPC had stopped functioning at several sites. 
      * Horst mentioned that HTPC should now be working again at OU. Greg will give this a test. 
      * Greg is working with Clemson to get it working again there.
   * Plan is to start a weekly testing infrastructure to make sure that the we keep our HTPC capabiities up to date on the OSG. These tests should start next week (Greg)
   * To better support HTPC on Condor, a new system for draining nodes has been implemented in Condor 7.7.5 by Dan B. The next step is for Glow to start testing this and see how it works prior to making recommendations for an updated Condor HTPC setup. Est time frame to begin testing is expected to be in early Jan. (Greg) 
   * As we transition to the RPM CE code on OSG, we need to make sure the documentation supports HTPC from the start. Greg to edit the latest install doc. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallComputeElement
   * FSU is upgrading their Condor infrastructure that includes setting up a second Condor cluster. Once this is complete he will set up a Campus Grid at FSU. (Donnie)
