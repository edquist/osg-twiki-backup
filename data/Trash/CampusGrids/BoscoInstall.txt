---# Introduction 
%STARTSECTION{"BoscoIntroduction"}%
BOSCO is a job submission manager designed to help researchers manage large numbers (~1000s) of job submissions to 
the different resources that they can access on a campus.
This is release 1.2 of BOSCO, if you find any problems or need help installing or running !Bosco, please email bosco-discuss@opensciencegrid.org .

It offers the following capabilities: 
   * Jobs are automatically resubmitted when they fail. The researcher does not need to babysit their jobs.                                                                                       
   * Job submissions can be throttled to meet batch scheduler settings (e.g. only 10 jobs running concurrently). The researcher does not need to make multiple submissions. BOSCO handles that for them.    
   * BOSCO is designed to be flexible and allows jobs to be submitted to multiple clusters, with different job schedulers (e.g. PBS, LSF, SGE, HTCondor, SLURM*). 
The primary advantage for the researcher is that they only need to learn one job scheduler environment even if the clusters utilize different native environments.                                                                    

* SLURM support is via its PBS emulation

This document explains how to install, configure and use BOSCO for a single user.
We recommend to use the BoscoQuickStart guide (less flexible but easier and guided setup), if you plan to install BOSCO only for you (single user) and to connect it to only one cluster. BoscoQuickStart will give you a full installation but to learn how to connect to multiple resources you have to read this document, it is not explained in the quick start guide.

%STARTSECTION{"BoscoRequirements"}%
---# Requirements

%STARTSECTION{"BoscoGeneralRequirements"}%
   $ *BOSCO Submit-node*: This is the system that the researcher uses to submit jobs. In general it can be the user's laptop, workstation, or it can be another system that the user logs into for submitting jobs to the cluster.  *There can not be any Condor collector running on the submit node*, otherwise it will conflict with Bosco.
   $ *BOSCO resource (aka Cluster) submit-node*: This is the node that you normally login to on the PBS, SGE, LSF, SLURM or HTCondor cluster (the BOSCO resource that you'd like to add).
      $ *PBS flavors supported*: Torque and PBSPro
      $ *HTCondor flavors supported*: HTCondor 7.6 or later
      $ *SGE flavors supported*: no special requirements (Sun Grid Engine and other Grid Engine versions supported)
      $ *LSF flavors*: no special requirements
      $ *SLURM flavors*: requires Torque/PBS command wrappers (from SLURM contrib)
   $ *BOSCO resource (aka Cluster)*: This is the remote cluster that jobs will execute on (the BOSCO resource).  The Cluster submit-node is a node belonging to this cluster. The nodes where jobs run are referred as worker nodes.  All the cluster needs:
      $ *Shared Filesystem*: The Cluster needs a shared home filesystem (if the Cluster has no shared filesystem only Grid universe jobs can be sent to it)
      $ *Network Access*: The worker nodes need to have access to the submit host.  The worker nodes can be behind a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation][NAT]] between the worker nodes and the submit host.
%NOTE% The BOSCO resource requirements just listed (shared file system and outbound network access) are required only if you submit jobs using the HTCondor _vanilla_ universe. If you submit jobs using the *grid universe*, submitting to one resource at the time, then both requirements can be relaxed. I.e. there is *no need of a shared file system or access to the BOSCO submit host from the BOSCO resource*.

BOSCO can be used as part of a more complex Condor setup (with flocking or multiple pools). Whatever the setup:
   * the BOSCO host needs connectivity to the cluster submit nodes of the BOSCO resources
   * the worker nodes of the BOSCO resources (running the jobs, e.g. the nodes in the PBS cluster) must have network connectivity to the jobs submit node (the BOSCO host or a different Condor schedd flocking into it)
%ENDSECTION{"BoscoGeneralRequirements"}%


---## Networking
#FirewallReq
%STARTSECTION{"Firewalls"}%

---+++!! BOSCO submit host

These firewall requirements are for the [[CampusGrids.BoSCO][BOSCO]] submit host. 

%NOTE% The port 11000 is required *ONLY* if "vanilla" jobs are submitted. "vanilla" jobs require also that all worker nodes be able to reach the submit host: this means that the submit host has to have a public IP address or at least an address known by all BOSCO resources that are going to be added. If you need to use a port different form 11000, you can edit the BOSCO configuration.

---# How to Install


---## Installation Procedure

   1. [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/][Download]] Bosco from the bosco website.  We recommend the *Multi-Platform* installer. It is a bit more complex than the [[BoscoQuickStart][quick start installation]] but allows more options. 
   1. Untar Bosco from the command line:
   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cd Downloads
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xzf boscoinstaller.tar.gz
</pre>
   1. Run the installer:
   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% python boscoinstaller
</pre>

<!--
   1. Download the BOSCO installer using one of these alternatives (browser, =wget=, =curl=) then continue with step two:
      * BOSCO comes in multiple flavors depending on your platform.  The multiplatform installer will download and install the correct flavor for you. Click on [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download-form/?package=latest/boscoinstaller][this link to the download page]], fill in the form, and then save the file in your home directory. If your browser is saving the file in a different folder (e.g the Downloads folder), then move the file to your home directory before continuing with step 2.
      * If you are logged into another machine, you can use =wget= and the download link provided on the website, shown in screenshot below.  You can copy / paste the link into a terminal if needed:
      * %ATTACHURL%/boscodownloadscreenshot.png
   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cd ~
%UCL_PROMPT% wget %RED%ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/...%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
      * If you have no =wget=, you can use =curl= to download:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% curl -o ~/boscoinstaller.tar.gz %RED%ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/condor/...%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
   1. Uncompress, change the file permission and Install BOSCO: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xzf ~/boscoinstaller.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% chmod +x ~/boscoinstaller 
%UCL_PROMPT% ~/boscoinstaller 
</pre>
   1. Remove the installer file: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% rm ~/boscoinstaller

Condor has been installed into:
    /Users/marco/bosco

Configured condor using these configuration files:
  global: /Users/marco/bosco/etc/condor_config
  local:  /Users/marco/bosco/local.bosco/condor_config.local

In order for Condor to work properly you must set your CONDOR_CONFIG
environment variable to point to your Condor configuration file:
/Users/marco/bosco/etc/condor_config before running Condor
commands/daemons.
Created a script you can source to setup your Condor environment
variables. This command must be run each time you log in or may
be placed in your login scripts:
   source /Users/marco/bosco/bosco_setenv

Congratulations, you installed BOSCO succesfully!

%STARTSECTION{"BoscoUse"}%
---# How to Use

%STARTSECTION{"BoscoUseShort"}%
Now BOSCO is installed. To use it:
   1. Setup the environment
   1. Add all the desired clusters (at least one)
   1. Start BOSCO
   1. Submit a test job
   1. Ready to submit a real job

---## Setup environment before using
#SetupEnvironment
Since BOSCO is not installed in the system path. An environment file must be sourced all the times you use BOSCO (start/stop/job submission or query, anything):
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv
</pre>

---## Starting BOSCO 
#BoscoStart
BOSCO has some persistent services that must be running. You'll have to start it at the beginning and probably after each reboot of your host.
You should stop BOSCO before an upgrade and possibly before a shutdown of your host.
If you will not use BOSCO anymore, uninstall will remove it from your system.

To start BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_start
</pre>


---## Add a cluster to BOSCO
%STARTSECTION{"BoscoAddResource"}%
#AddResourceSection
To add a new cluster to the resources you will be using through BOSCO:
   1. Setup the environment appropriate for your shell as described in the [[#SetupEnvironment][setup environment section]] (above).
   1. For the cluster %RED%mycluster%ENDCOLOR% with user %RED%username%ENDCOLOR% and submit host %RED%mycluster-submit.mydomain.org%ENDCOLOR% (Fully Qualified Domain Name, aka full hostname including the domain name) and Local Resource Management System %RED%LRMS%ENDCOLOR% (valid values are =pbs=, =condor=, =sge= or =lsf=). Replace the parts in red: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --add %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain.org LRMS%ENDCOLOR%

</pre> %ENDTWISTY%

When you add your first cluster, BOSCO will prompt you for a password that will be used to store the SSH keys used by BOSCO to access all your clusters (=Enter password for bosco ssh key:=). Select a random string. It is preferable if you do not use the password you use to access the cluster or to unlock your SSH keys.

Then, if you don't have a ssh key agent with that cluster enabled, you will be prompted for the password that you use to access the cluster you are adding to BOSCO (=Enter password to copy ssh keys to ...=). This may be followed by a confirmation of the RSA key fingerprint, if it is your first ssh connection from this host, where you have to answer =yes=.

%IMPORTANT% You must be able to login to the remote cluster. If password authentication is OK, the script will ask you for your password. If key only login is allowed, then you must load your key in the =ssh-agent=. Here is an example adding the key and testing the login: %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% eval `ssh-agent`
Agent pid 17103;
%UCL_PROMPT% ssh-add id_rsa_bosco 
Enter passphrase for id_rsa_bosco: 
Identity added: id_rsa_bosco (id_rsa_bosco)

</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%
 

%IMPORTANT% Some clusters have multiple login nodes behind a round robin DNS server. You can recognize them because when you login to the node (e,g: ==ssh login.mydomain.org==), it will show a name different form the one used to connect (e.g.: ==hostname -f== will return ==login2.mydomain.org==). If this happens you must add the BOSCO resources by using a name of the host, not the DNS alias (e.g. ==bosco_cluster --add login2.mydomain.org==). This is because sometime these multiple login nodes do not share all the directories and BOSCO may be unable to find its files if different connections land on different hosts : %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%  Note how =midway-login2.rcc.uchicago.edu= is use instead of =midway.rcc.uchicago.edu=: <pre class="screen">

---## How to Stop and Remove
To stop BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_stop
</pre>

To uninstall BOSCO:
   * If you want to remove remote clusters get the list and remove them one by one: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --list
# For each remote cluster 
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster -r %RED%user@cluster_as_spelled_in_list%ENDCOLOR%</pre>
   * Remove the installation directory:  <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_uninstall</pre>

%NOTE% Uninstalling BOSCO removes the software but leaves the files in your =.bosco= and =.ssh= directories with all the information about the added clusters and the SSH keys. Files installed on the remote clusters are not removed either. 

---## How to Update BOSCO
If you want to update BOSCO to a new version you have to:
   1. setup BOSCO:<pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv</pre>
   1. stop BOSCO: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_stop</pre>
   1. remove the old BOSCO: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_uninstall</pre>
   1. download and install the new BOSCO (see install section above)  and re-add all the clusters in your setup:
   1. for each installed cluster (the list is returned by =bosco_cluster --list=):
      1. remove the cluster: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --remove %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain.org%ENDCOLOR% </pre>
      1. add the cluster: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --add %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain.org queue%ENDCOLOR% </pre>
   1. start BOSCO: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_start</pre>

This will update the local installation and the software on the remote clusters
%ENDSECTION{"BoscoSetup"}%

%STARTSECTION{"BoscoJob"}%
---# Job submission example

You can submit a regular Condor vanilla job to BOSCO. The Campus Factory, a component within BOSCO, will take care to run it on the different clusters that you added and to transfer the input and output files as needed.
Here is a simple example. The Condor team provides [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/tutorials/][many great tutorials]] to learn more.

 
---## Configuring Executable
Your may wrap your job in a script (e.g. using your favorite shell or Python) so that you can invoke more executables and do some tests.

This is a simple bash script, called =myjob.sh=: <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

# Prepare for the execution

# Run the actual applications
hostname 
date 
id 
whoami 

# Final steps

</pre>


---## Example Submission File
With BOSCO you can do direct submission to the cluster, using the grid universe, or use the the glideins so that regular (vanilla) HTCondor jobs can be used.
There is a small difference between the 2 options is in the submit file (see below) and vanilla have some additional [[BoscoInstall#FirewallReq][Firewall and Network requirements]] because they use glideins.
All the other steps, job file creation, job submission and checking the jobs, are the same.

*Use one or the other*

---### Direct Job submission example

Here is an example submission file for direct submission.  Copy it to a file, =example.condor=
<pre class="file">
universe = grid
grid_resource = batch %RED%pbs%ENDCOLOR% marco@uc3-pbs.uchicago.edu
Executable     = myjob.sh
arguments = )
output = myjob.out
error = myjob.error
log = myjob.log
transfer_output_files = 
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
queue 1
</pre>

The type of cluster that you are submitting to, pbs, lsf, sge, or condor, must be supplied on the grid_resource line.

---### Glidein Job submission example

You can submit a regular HTCondor vanilla job to BOSCO. The Campus Factory, a component within BOSCO, will take care to run it on the different clusters that you added and to transfer the input and output files as needed.
Here follow a simple example. The Condor team provides [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/tutorials/][many great tutorials]] to learn more.

Here is an example of  a vanilla submission file (using glideins).  Copy it to a file, =example.condor=
<pre class="file">
universe = vanilla
Executable     = myjob.sh
arguments = $(Cluster) $(Process)
output = cfjob.out.$(Cluster)-$(Process)
error = cfjob.err.$(Cluster)-$(Process)
log = cfjob.log.$(Cluster)
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
queue 1
</pre>

%NOTE% The BOSCO submit host needs to satisfy these additional [[BoscoInstall#FirewallReq][Firewall and Network requirements]] to be able to submit and run vanilla jobs. Those requirement include being reachable by all BOSCO resources. 

---## Job Submission
Submit the job file =example.condor= with the =condor_submit= command: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_submit example.condor
</pre>

---## Job Monitoring
Monitor the job with =condor_q=.  For example, the job when idle is: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q

-- Submitter: uc3-c001.mwt2.org : <10.1.3.101:45876> : uc3-c001.mwt2.org

  19.0   marco           7/6  13:46   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  glidein_wrapper.sh

8 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 8 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
</pre>

*NOTE* That condor_q will show also the glidein jobs. Auxiliary jobs that BOSCO is using to run your actual job. Like in the example above, job 11 was the one submitted.

The job could be idle if it is currently idle at the remote cluster.  When the job is being executed on the remote cluster, the =ST= (State) will change to =R=, and the =RUN_TIME= will grow.

Another method of monitoring a job is to check the job's =log=, a human readable (for the most part) time line of actions relating to the job.  The =logfile= was specified in the submission script, for example =logfile= in the example above.  You can view the log file by using =cat=: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cat logfile
</pre>

---## Job output
Once the job completes BOSCO will transfer back standard output, standard error and the output files (if specified in the submit file), e.g. the job above will create stdout and stderr files (unique for each submission) and a file =myout-file-10= in the directory where the =condor_submit= command was executed.

---## Multi homed hosts
Multi homed hosts are hosts with multiple Network Interfaces (aka dual-homed when they have 2 NICs).
BOSCO configuration is tricky on multi-homed hosts. BOSCO requires the submit host to be able to connect back to the BOSCO host, so it must advertise an interface that is reachable from all the chosen submit hosts. E.g. a host with a NIC on a private network and one with a public IP address must advertise the public address if the submit hosts are outside of the private network. 
In order to do that you have to:
   * make sure that the name returned by the command =/bin/hostname -f= is the name resolving in the public address (e.g. =host `hostname -f`= should return the public address). If not you should change it.
   * edit =~/bosco/local.%RED%$HOST%ENDCOLOR%/condor_config.local= (HOST is the short host name) and add a line like =NETWORK_INTERFACE = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx= , substituting xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx with the public IP address. This will tell BOSCO to use that address.


---## Modifying maximum number of submitted jobs to a resource

Many clusters limit the number of jobs that can be submitted to the scheduler.  For PBS, we are able to detect this limit.  For SGE and LSF, we are not able to detect this limit.  In the cases where we cannot find the limit, we set the maximum number of jobs very conservatively, to a maximum of 10.  This includes both the number of idle and running jobs to the cluster.

The limit is specified in the condor config file =~/bosco/local.bosco/condor_config.local=, at the bottom.  Edit the value of the configuration variable =GRIDMANAGER_MAX_SUBMITTED_JOBS_PER_RESOURCE=

<pre class="file">
GRIDMANAGER_MAX_SUBMITTED_JOBS_PER_RESOURCE = %RED%10%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---## Custom submit properties
Bosco has the ability to add custom submit properties to every job submitted to a cluster.  On the cluster's login node (the host you used when issuing the =--add= command), create the file 

#CustomScriptLocations
   * *PBS* - =~/bosco/glite/bin/pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh=
   * *Condor* - =~/bosco/glite/bin/condor_local_submit_attributes.sh=
   * *SGE* (and other GE) - =~/bosco/glite/bin/sge_local_submit_attributes.sh=
   * *LSF* - =~/bosco/glite/bin/lsf_local_submit_attributes.sh=

This file is executed and the output is inserted into the submit script.

Below is an example =pbs_local_submit_attributes.sh= script which will cause every job submitted to this cluster through Bosco to request 1 node with 8 cores:
<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh

echo "#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8"
</pre>

---### Passing parameters to the custom submit properties.
You may also pass parameters to the custom scripts by adding a special parameter to the Bosco submit script.

For example, in your Bosco submit script, add: <pre class="file">
...
%RED%+remote_cerequirements = NumJobs == 100%ENDCOLOR%
...
queue
</pre>

After you submit this job to Bosco, it will execute the [[#CustomScriptLocations][custom scripts]] with, in this example, =NumJobs= set in the environment equal to =100=.  The custom script can take advantage of these values.  For example, a PBS script can use the !NumJobs: <pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh

echo "#PBS -l select=$NumJobs"
</pre>

This will set the number of requested cores from PBS to !NumJobs specified in the original Bosco Submit file.

---# Troubleshooting

---## Useful Configuration and Log Files
BOSCO underneath is using Condor. You can find all the Condor log files in =~/bosco/local.HOSTNAME/log=



%STARTSECTION{"BoscoTroubleshootingItems"}%
---## Make sure that you can connect to the BOSCO host
If you see errors like:<pre class="screen">
 Installing BOSCO on user@osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu...
 ssh: connect to host osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu port 22: Connection timed out
 rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
 rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(600) [sender=3.0.6]
 ssh: connect to host osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu port 22: Connection timed out
 rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]

 ssh: connect to host osg-ss-submit.chtc.wisc.edu port 22: Connection timed out
 rsync: connection unexpectedly closed (0 bytes received so far) [sender]
 rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(600) [sender=3.0.6]
</pre>
Please try manually to ssh from the BOSCO host to the cluster submit node. The ability to connect is required in order to install BOSCO.

---## Make sure that BOSCO is running
BOSCO may not survive after you log out, for example if the BOSCO node was restarted while you where logged out. 
When you log back in after sourcing the setup as described in the [[#SetupEnvironment][setup environment section]], you should start BOSCO as described in the [[#BoscoStart][BOSCO start section]], specially if the command =condor_q= is failing.

---## Errors due to leftover files
Bosco files on the submit host are in:
   * =~/bosco/= - the release directory
   * =~/.bosco/= - some service files
   * =~/.ssh/= - the ssh key used by BOSCO

If you used =bosco_uninstall= it will remove all BOSCO related files. If you removed BOSCO by hand you must pay attention.
If the service key is still in =.ssh= but the other files are missing, during the execution of BOSCO commands you will get some unclear errors like 
_"IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/marco/.bosco/.pass'"_ , _"OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error"_ , all followed by:
<pre>Password-less ssh to marco@itb2.uchicago.edu did NOT work, even after adding the ssh-keys.
Does the remote resource allow password-less ssh?
</pre>

If that happens you can remove the service files and the keys using:<pre>rm -r ~/.bosco
rm ~/.ssh/bosco_key.rsa*</pre>
and then re-add all the clusters with =bosco_cluster --add=.

---## Unable to download and prepare BOSCO for remote installation. 
BOSCO can return this error:
   1. Because the BOSCO submit host is unable to download BOSCO for the resource installation, e.g. a firewall is blocking the download or the server is down
   2. More commonly because there are problems with the login host of the BOSCO resource, e.g. the disk is full or there are multiple login nodes
You can check 1 byy downloading BOSCO on your BOSCO submit host.
To check 2 you have to login on the BOSCO resource: =df= will tell you you some disks are full, with =hostname -f= you can check if the name is different form the one that you used to login with ssh. If the name differs probably you are using a cluster with multiple login nodes and you must use only one for BOSCO. Se the second "IMPORTANT" note in the [[#AddResourceSection][section to add a cluster to BOSCO]] (above).

If you see errors similar to the one below while executing ==bosco_cluster --add==:
<pre class="screen">
Downloading for USER@RESOURCE
Unpacking.tar: Cannot save working directory 
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now 
ls: /tmp/tmp.qeIJ9139/condor*: No such file or directory 
Unable to download and prepare BOSCO for remote installation. 
</pre>
then you are using most likely the generic name of a multi-login cluster and you should use the name of one of the nodes as suggested in the [[#AddResourceSection][note above]].
