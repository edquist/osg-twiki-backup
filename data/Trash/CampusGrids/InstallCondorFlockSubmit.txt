---++ About this document
This document is intended for system administrators or users with root access to a submit host.  It will guide you through installation of a submit host that can execute jobs on the OSG by communicating with one of many well known OSG submit hosts.

The OSG Condor Flocking configuration is distributed in a RPM.  We distribute the RPM with the official OSG Release.

---++ Installation of the OSG Condor Flock RPM
To install, you must enable the osg development repo and install from there.
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% yum --enablerepo=osg-development --nogpgcheck install osg-condor-flock </pre>

---++ Configuration of the Submit Machine
The primary configuration is in =/etc/condor/config.d/99_osg_flock.conf=.  You will need to edit this.

The =FLOCK_TO= specifies the hosts that you want to send jobs.  The currently supported OSG submit hosts are =ENGAGE_RENCI= (default) and =HCC=.  The hosts are listed in =/etc/condor/config.d/98_flock_hosts.conf=.
