-- Main.DanFraser - 16 Dec 2010
---+++ Attendees:
   * Derek Weitzel, David Swanson, Brian Bockelman, Ben Cotton,  Michael Moore, Joel Snow, Shawn McKee, Dan Fraser
Did I miss anyone?

---+++ Notes:
   * Michael made a first attempt at configuring the Campus Factory. Will try again and contact Derek (or better the campus grids mailing list) if he runs into any problems. Ben had not had a chance to try it yet. 
   * Purdue/Nebraska flocking seems to be working. Ben noted that the User Services folks at Purdue do not recommend that users use the transfer files option. As a result, nearly all the Purdue jobs have some requirement (file system, environment variables, ...) that depends on Purdue resources only and so cannot be sent offsite. There is also little motivation for users at Purdue to send jobs offsite since the onsite capacity is very large. 
   * Joel to contact Dick Greenwood, LTU (who has expressed interest in setting up a campus grid between LTU and OU) and suggest that he join the next call, hopefully with Horst from OU online as well. We can get more information and make recommendations about next steps. 
   * Next steps on the Campus Factory: Derek is looking at creating a gratia startd probe to accurately record jobs submitted remotely. Also plan to try running an HTPC version of the campus factory in parallel with the single core version.
   * There would likely be interest in OSG hosting a centralized Gratia collector that campuses could use to visualize and monitor campus grid usage without needing to set up their own Gratia instance. 
   * Need to create a twiki document that describes the benefits (and scope) of campus grids that we can point people to who are interested in setting up a campus grid. Dan to take a first cut.
