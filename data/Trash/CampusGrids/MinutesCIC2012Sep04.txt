   * Brooklin: need a website to learn more about the talk to be presented
   * Mark: about schedule - try to make topics autonomous as possible, though ordering is important.  Focus on self-containment.  Getting speakers scheduled. 
   * Mark: would be good to have another meeting at the end of the year to assess how things are going.
   * Mark: Slide review, could be done either via email or someone could organize a quick call.
