---# Introduction 

BOSCO is a job submission manager designed to help researchers manage large numbers (~1000s) of job submissions to 
the different resources that they can access on a campus (initially a PBS cluster running Linux).
This is release 1.1 of BOSCO, if you find any problems or need help installing or running !BoSCO, please email bosco-discuss@opensciencegrid.org .

It offers the following capabilities: 
   * Jobs are automatically resubmitted when they fail. The researcher does not need to babysit their jobs.                                                                                       
   * Job submissions can be throttled to meet batch scheduler settings (e.g. only 10 jobs running concurrently). The researcher does not need to make multiple submissions. BOSCO handles that for them.    
   * BOSCO is designed to be flexible and allows jobs to be submitted to multiple clusters, with different job schedulers (e.g. PBS, LSF, Condor). 
The primary advantage for the researcher is that they only need to learn one job scheduler environment even if the clusters utilize different native environments.

---# BOSCO versions and BOSCO documents
The BOSCO submit node is the host where BOSCO is installed and where user/s login to submit jobs via BOSCO.
The multiple clusters added to BOSCO (i.e. where the user/s can submit jobs via BOSCO) are referred as BOSCO resources.

This page explains how to use BOSCO. Before using BOSCO you, or someone for you, will have to install a version of BOSCO and add at least one BOSCO resource.
Adding, testing and removing BOSCO resources is part of the BOSCO configuration.

[[BoscoInstall][BOSCO Single User]] allows a researcher to install BOSCO in her/his (non-privileged) account, to configure it and to use it 
To install and configure BOSCO Single-user read BoscoInstall.

[[BoscoMultiUser][BOSCO Multi User]] is installed, configured and started on a host by the system administrator (root) and is available to all the users on the host.
To install and configure BOSCO Multi-user read BoscoMultiUser.

Later in this document we'll assume that BOSCO has been already installed and configured correctly. For the installation or to change the configuration (e.g. to add or remove BOSCO resources) please check the other documents: BoscoInstall and BoscoMultiUser .

---# Requirements

There are specific requirements for the BOSCO resources that are specified in the install documents.

To use BOSCO you need a BOSCO submit host with BOSCO installed and configured correctly.
All requirements for the BOSCO submit host and the BOSCO resources, as well as the requirements to include BOSCO in a more complex Condor setup, are described in the install documents.

---# How to Install

Either you or a system administrator for you will have to install and setup BOSCO. 
The installation consists in downloading and installing the BOSCO software.
The setup consists in managing which clusters are included in the BOSCO pool and will execute your jobs; it includes all the operations performed using the =bosco_cluster= command.
The installation and setup are covered in two separate documents:
   * to install and setup BOSCO so that it is used and configured from a single user account please refer to BoscoInstall
   * to install and setup BOSCO so that it is configured from a single user account but it can be used by all the accounts on the host please refer to BoscoMultiUser

---# How to Use

In order to use BOSCO and submit a job:
   1. BOSCO must be installed
   1. BOSCO must be running (it must have been started)
   1. At least one cluster must have been added to BOSCO
   1. You must setup the environment

---## Starting/Stopping and Configuring BOSCO 
Each time I mention "you" in this section I refer either to you or to a system administrator that acts on your behalf, probably the same person that installed BOSO.
 
BOSCO has some persistent services that must be running. You'll have to start it at the beginning and probably after each reboot of your host.
You should stop BOSCO before an upgrade and possibly before a shutdown of your host.
If you will not use BOSCO anymore, uninstall will remove it from your system.

You need to add to BOSCO all the clusters of which you like to use the resources. In order to run jobs you need at least one.

Please refer to the BoscoInstall or BoscoMultiUser documents for operations including:
   * starting BOSCO
   * stopping BOSCO
   * updating BOSCO
   * uninstalling BOSCO
   * adding one or more clusters to BOSCO

---## Setup environment before using
Since BOSCO is not installed in the system path. An environment file must be sourced all the times you use BOSCO (start/stop/job submission or query, anything):
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv
</pre>

%INCLUDE{"BoscoInstall" section="BoscoJob"}%


---# Troubleshooting


---## Useful Configuration and Log Files
BOSCO underneath is using Condor. You can find all the Condor log files in =~/bosco/local.HOSTNAME/log=

---## Known Issues

---## Make sure that BOSCO is running
BOSCO may not survive after you log out.
When you log back in after sourcing the setup (=source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv=), if you are using BOSCO single-user you should start BOSCO (=bosco_start=) specially if the command =condor_q= is failing.
More details about starting BOSCO are in BoscoInstall and BoscoMultiUser
