---++ Summary of Changes

The bugtracker contains most of the [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?filter=12252][changes for Bosco 1.2]]. The highlights of this release are:

   * *Added Bosco Quickstart* - Adding a bosco quickstart for a guided setup for first time users.
   * *Cluster Support* - Out of the box support of LSF and SLURM clusters.
   * *Memory Specification* - Support for request_memory to be translated to the remote resource manager.  Now when you specify request_memory in the submit file, it will be translated appropriately on the remote cluster (mem on PBS, request_memory on condor).
   * *Enhanced Scalability* - Run thousands of bosco jobs on the remote clusters.
   * *Simplified Bosco Installation* - Less interaction with the user for installation
   * *Better error messages* - Bosco now gives better error messages when things go wrong
   * *Lower number of SSH connections* - Installation now requires only 2 SSH connections to the cluster, decreased from ~15 in a 1 second..
