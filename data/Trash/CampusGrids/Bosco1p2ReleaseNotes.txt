---++!! Abstract
Bosco 1.2 is out. You will notice right away that it is much easier to install, particularly if you never used cluster management software before. Have a look at the new [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoscoQuickStart][Bosco QuickStart]] to see what we mean. Compared to 1.1,  Bosco 1.2 will handle more jobs than ever before, will send clearer error messages. and it is easier to specify the memory you need inside the clusters you connect to. The details are in the Release Notes, but there is no need to read them. Just go the [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/][download]] site and install it. Let us know what you think.

---++ Summary of Changes

The bugtracker contains most of the [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/issues/?filter=12252][changes for Bosco 1.2]]. The highlights of this release are:

   * *Added Bosco Quickstart* - Adding a bosco quickstart for a guided setup for first time users. =bosco_quickstart= installs BOSCO if needed and guides the user through an interactive connection of a cluster to BOSCO.
   * *Cluster Support* - Out of the box support of LSF and SLURM clusters.
   * *Memory Specification* - Support for request_memory to be translated to the remote resource manager.  Now when you specify request_memory in the submit file, it will be translated appropriately on the remote cluster (mem on PBS, request_memory on condor).
   * *Enhanced Scalability* - Run thousands of bosco jobs on the remote clusters.
   * *Simplified Bosco Installation* - Less interaction with the user for installation
   * *Better error messages* - Bosco now gives better error messages when things go wrong
   * *Lower number of SSH connections* - Installation now requires only 2 SSH connections to the cluster, decreased from ~15 in a 1 second..
