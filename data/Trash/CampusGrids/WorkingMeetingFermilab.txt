---++ Introduction
   * Date: 1/19/10 to 1/20/10
   * Location: Fermilab
   * A working meeting to prepare a technical summary document describing and comparing current CG implementations, best practices and common patterns, as well as address technical issues moving forward in four topical areas identified last time (there may be more resulting from the workshop): global storage systems at the CG, seamless user environments, role and use of vm & cloud computing technologies, as well as challenges dealing with campus provincial issues (or how technical progress might inform that, or stimulating growth of a movement/community that provide clear examples of the benefits associated with CGs)
   * Previous planning meetings: MinutesDec15, MinutesJan5

---++ Workshop organization
   * The meeting will being at 10 am, January 19 and end at 4pm January 20
   * The deliverable of the meeting will be the CG technical document signed by all participants
   * The first morning will be providing a download and inventory of current implementations, noting best practices & challenges.   A comparison table will be created summarizing this discussion.  We expect to hear about GLOW, Purdue, Fermigrid, and Chapel Hill in particular.
   * The first afternoon will be driven by topic, namely the four mentioned above (at least).  Before the end of the first day people will be assigned topics for overnight homework/R&D and will prepare more in-depth summary notes and references for input into the document. 
   *  The morning of January 20 - each person will present their topical summary to the group for discussion.
   * Afternoon January 20: *collating* of contributions into the CG technical summary document.
   * Adjourn by 4pm, with a completed document submitted to the OSG EB.
