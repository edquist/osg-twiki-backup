---+!! Bosco-R Instructions

%WARNING% This is a alpha document.  It will be constantly changing and may not work at all.

Bosco-R is the transparent integration of the [[http://www.r-project.org/][R statistics]] computing environment with [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/][Bosco]].

%TOC%

---++ Requirements

   1. Installation of R on your submit machine.  You can find binaries on the [[http://cran.rstudio.com/][R website]]

---++ Installation Instructions

Installation is a three step process:

   1. Install Bosco
   1. Connect 1 cluster to Bosco
   1. Install the Bosco+GridR package.

Both the installation of Bosco and connecting a cluster are both covered in the Bosco [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoscoQuickStart][quick start guide]], please use that guide to install and configure Bosco.  This document will only cover the installation of the Bosco+GridR package.

---+++ Install Modified !GridR
%NOTE% This section will be greatly simplified once the modifications to !GridR have been sent upstream.

Download [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/xc7otv4oe4c3xkx/GridR_0.9.2.tar.gz][GridR]].  Install with the command line:
<pre class="file">
%UCL_PROMPT% R CMD INSTALL --build GridR_0.9.2.tar.gz 
</pre>


---+++ Install R on the remote cluster
%NOTE% This section will be completely removed when the transparent installation implementation is complete.

A modified version of R must be installed on the remote cluster that you connected with Bosco.  You need to download the version of R for your operating system:

   * EL5/CentOS5/RHEL5: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/a1fb39cvg5oybhv/el5-R-modified.tar.gz -O R-modified.tar.gz
</pre>
   * EL6/CentOS6/RHEL6:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/7qfa9no0ckusuys/el6-R-modified.tar.gz -O R-modified.tar.gz
</pre>


Then you need to unpack the R tar ball to the correct directory:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xzf R-modified.tar.gz -C bosco/
</pre>


---++ Using BoscoR

---+++ A simple example.

Start R, or RStudio, or whatever R environment you prefer.  First, you need to load the !GridR library:
<pre class="screen">
> library("GridR")
</pre>

Then, you need to initialize !GridR to use Bosco:
<pre class="screen">
> grid.init(service="bosco.direct", localTmpDir="tmp")
</pre>

Now you are ready to create a function and send it to the connected cluster.  Below is a very simple function that will double the input value:
<pre class="screen">
> a <- function(s) { return (2*s) }
</pre>

Now, you can send it to the remote cluster.
<pre class="screen">
> grid.apply("x", a, 13)
starting bosco.direct mode
</pre>

You can check on the status of the job with the command grid.printJobs():
<pre class="screen">
> grid.printJobs()
</pre>
