---++ About the Campus Grids activity
---+++ Mission
From the [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][Campus Cyberinfrastructre Days site]], with which this activity is affiliated:

The Campus Grids activity aims "to introduce Cyberinfrastructre to a broad range of academic researchers and facilitate their entry, via campus-centered efforts, into the HPC and data-sharing communities, with the goal of promoting progress of science and engineering.

The campus-centered efforts are designed to bring together players from campus, regional and national CI projects in order that the CI projects educate campuses about CI opportunities and technologies, that they understand campuses' needs, and help campuses plan how to provide CI functions. "
