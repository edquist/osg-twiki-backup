OSG is fundamentally invested in enabling High Throughput Computing (HTC) capabilities locally at the nations campuses in support of science, research and education locally as well as enabling these campuses to participate fully in the national cyber-infrastructure. High Throughput Computing is a natural mechanism to share and distribute workloads since single processor jobs can often be distributed across multiple systems.

This adoption of HTC sharing capabilities within a campus offers benefits in several key areas: 
   * Use of a larger resource pool 
   * Improved (policy driven) resource utilization 
   * Higher fault tolerance (If one system goes out, others can take up the load)
   * Reduced costs 
In short, shared campus infrastructures make researchers (and communities) more competitive by enabling access to more resources, and allowing them to get more science done faster. 

To lower the barriers for campuses to adopt shared infrastructures we recognize that local campus credentials should be sufficient to access shared campus resources. At the same time, users with grid credentials should be able to use the exact same job submission framework to extend their HTC usage to submit jobs either to the OSG or to the !TeraGrid.

One model that has been successfully implemented at some institutions is the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.8/5_2Connecting_Condor.html][Condor Flocking]] mechanism to share resources on the same campus as well as between campuses. In this model one or more Condor submit hosts can be used to transparently distribute HTC jobs across all the shared resources. The same submit hosts can also be used to send jobs to OSG resources as well. An example of this capability includes flocking on and between campuses at the University of Wisconsin, University of Nebraska, and Purdue University. A limitation of this model however is that it only works between Condor managed clusters. 

To move beyond this limitation, the OSG has prototyped and is currently advancing a Campus Factory overlay mechanism that allows PBS (and other) cluster types to participate in the shared infrastructure. This is currently being used in production at the University of Nebraska. One submit host at UNL is able to send jobs across the three universities listed above as well as the PBS system at NERSC. Another important advantage is that it does not require root access to install the Campus Factory on a remote resource. Click the links below to see the documentation and how to try out this model on your campus. 

OSG is directly engaged with the US LHC Tier-3 sites on helping with their campus installations and broader collaborations: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/USLHCTier-3Group][US LHC - OSG Tier-3 Group]]. OSG also works with other organizations on [[http://cidays.org][cross-cutting activities]] to foster and help with local organizing across the university's groups.

---+++ Virtualization and Clouds
Virtualization and Clouds can help Campus grids build a resource they can share on the grid. Current efforts with the STAR VO are listed below.
They summarize how a campus can support an OSG VO via virtualization. Several other grass root efforts in Clouds and Virtualization were discussed at the 2010 All hands meeting [[http://indico.fnal.gov/sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=9&slotId=0&confId=2871#2010-03-08][VM Workshop]].
