OSG works with 
campus organizations to adapt their local faculty and IT facility computing to provide a shared common resource equivalent to the OSG itself. 

Once the campus is self-organized locally or regionally it then interacts as needed with the national infrastructure provided by the OSG to use similar computing resources remotely.

OSG also works with other organizations for a [[http://cidays.org][cross-cutting activity to visit Campuses]] to foster and help with local organizing across the university's groups.

OSG works specifically with the US LHC Tier-3 sites on helping with their campus installations and broader collaborations: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/USLHCTier-3Group][US LHC - OSG Tier-3 Group]]

Contact the mail list osg-campus-grids@opensciencegrid.org or member of the OSG Campus Activity at for more information and support.

---++ Virtualization and Clouds
Virtualization and Clouds can help Campus grids build a resource they can share on the grid. Current efforts with the STAR VO are listed below.
They summarize how a campus can support an OSG VO via virtualization. Several other grass root efforts in Clouds and Virtualization were discussed at the 2010 All hands meeting [[http://indico.fnal.gov/sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=9&slotId=0&confId=2871#2010-03-08][VM Workshop]].
