OSG works with 
campus organizations to adapt their local faculty and IT facility computing to provide a shared common resource equivalent to the OSG itself. 

Once the campus is self-organized locally or regionally it then interacts as needed with the national infrastructure provided by the OSG to use similar computing resources remotely.

OSG also works with other organizations for a [[http://cidays.org][cross-cutting activity to visit Campuses]] to foster and help with local organizing across the university's groups.

Contact either member of the Campus Grids Team for more information and support.

The Campus Grids activity in OSG works with the Engagement activity to extend the benefits of grid computing to new research communities. In addition, OSG participates in the Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Days effort that is focused on campuses.

 Feel free to contact Sebastien or John, or one of the other CI Days participants.
