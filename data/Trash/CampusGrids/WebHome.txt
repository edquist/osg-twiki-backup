OSG is fundamentally invested in the advancement of science at both the intra-campus level as well as the inter-campus level. OSG enables and promotes collaboration via effective resource sharing within University campuses and between university campuses, and via the interaction of campuses with external grids. OSG also works with other organizations on [[http://cidays.org][cross-cutting activities]] to foster and help with local organizing across the university's groups.

OSG is directly engaged with the US LHC Tier-3 sites on helping with their campus installations and broader collaborations: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/USLHCTier-3Group][US LHC - OSG Tier-3 Group]]

Contact the mail list campusgrids@fnal.gov or a member of the OSG Campus Activity at for more information and support.

---+++ Virtualization and Clouds
Virtualization and Clouds can help Campus grids build a resource they can share on the grid. Current efforts with the STAR VO are listed below.
They summarize how a campus can support an OSG VO via virtualization. Several other grass root efforts in Clouds and Virtualization were discussed at the 2010 All hands meeting [[http://indico.fnal.gov/sessionDisplay.py?sessionId=9&slotId=0&confId=2871#2010-03-08][VM Workshop]].
