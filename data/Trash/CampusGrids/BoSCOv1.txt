%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="3"}%


---# Introduction 

BOSCO is a job submission manager designed to help researchers manage large numbers (~1000s) of job submissions to 
the different resources that they can access on a campus (initially a PBS cluster running Linux).
This is the first release of BOSCO, v1, if you find any problems or need help installing or running !BoSCO, please email bosco-discuss@opensciencegrid.org .

It offers the following capabilities: 
   * Job are automatically resubmitted when they fail. The researcher does not need to babysit their jobs                                                                                       
   * Job submissions can be throttled to meet batch scheduler settings (e.g. only 10 jobs running concurrently). The researcher does not need to make multiple submissions. BOSCO handles that for them.    
   * BOSCO is designed to be flexible and allows jobs to be submitted to multiple clusters, with different job schedulers (e.g. PBS, LSF, Condor). 
The primary advantage for the researcher is that they only need to learn one job scheduler environment even if the clusters utilize different native environments.

---# How to Install

---## Requirements

   $ *Submit-node*: This is the system that the researcher uses to submit jobs. In general it can be the user's laptop, workstation, or it can be another system that the user logs into for submitting jobs to the cluster. A current requirement is that the submit-node must use the same Linux flavor that the PBS/LSF/Condor cluster is using.
   $ *Cluster head-node*: This is the node that you normally login to on the PBS, LSF or Condor cluster.
      $ *PBS flavors supportted*: Torque and PBSPro
      $ *Condor flavors supported*: Condor 7.6 or later
      $ *LSF flavors*: no special requirements
   $ *Cluster*: This is the remote cluster that jobs will execute on.  The Cluster head-node is a node belonging to this cluster.  The cluster needs:
      $ *Shared Filesystem*: The Cluster needs a shared home filesystem
      $ *Network Access*: The worker nodes need to have access to the submit host.  The worker nodes can be behind a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation][NAT]] between the worker nodes and the submit host.

Installing Condor from /share/home/marco/tmp-bosco/condor-7.7.6-UW_development-rhel5.8-stripped to /share/home/marco/bosco


Condor has been installed into:
    /share/home/marco/bosco

Configured condor using these configuration files:
  global: /share/home/marco/bosco/etc/condor_config
  local:  /share/home/marco/bosco/local.gc2-wn2/condor_config.local

In order for Condor to work properly you must set your CONDOR_CONFIG
environment variable to point to your Condor configuration file:
/share/home/marco/bosco/etc/condor_config before running Condor
commands/daemons.
Created scripts which can be sourced by users to setup their
Condor environment variables.  These are:
   sh: /share/home/marco/bosco/bosco.sh
  csh: /share/home/marco/bosco/bosco.csh
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

---# How to Use

Now BOSCO is installed. To use it:
   1. Setup the environment
   1. Add all the desired clusters (at least one)
   1. Start BOSCO
   1. Submit a test job
   1. Submit a real job

---## Setup environment before using
Since BOSCO is not installed in the system path. An environment file must be sourced all the times you use BOSCO (start/stop/job submission or query, anything):
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv
</pre>

---## Starting BOSCO 
BOSCO has some persistent services that must be running. You'll have to start it at the beginning and probably after each reboot of your host.
You should stop BOSCO before an upgrade and possibly before a shutdown of your host.
If you will not use BOSCO anymore, uninstall will remove it from your system.

To start BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_start
</pre>


---## Add a cluster to BOSCO
To add a new cluster to the resources you will be using through BOSCO:
   1. Setup the environment appropriate for your shell as described in the setup environment section (above).
   1. For the cluster %RED%mycluster%ENDCOLOR% with user %RED%username%ENDCOLOR% and submit host %RED%mycluster-submit.mydomain.org%ENDCOLOR% (Fully Qualified Domain Name, aka full hostname including the domain name) and queue manager %RED%queue%ENDCOLOR% (valid values are =PBS=, =Condor= or =LSF=). Replace the parts in red: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --add %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain.org queue%ENDCOLOR% 
</pre> %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%   <pre class="screen">
-bash-3.2$ bosco_cluster -add itbv-ce-pbs.uchicago.edu
Enter password to copy ssh keys to itbv-ce-pbs.uchicago.edu:
The authenticity of host 'itbv-ce-pbs.uchicago.edu (128.135.158.176)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 8e:a6:db:18:80:6b:b7:de:56:c8:5a:a2:75:19:11:8d.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'itbv-ce-pbs.uchicago.edu,128.135.158.176' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Installing BOSCO on itbv-ce-pbs.uchicago.edu...
Installation complete
</pre> %ENDTWISTY%

You can see a list of the current clusters in BOSCO by typing:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --list
</pre>
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%   <pre class="screen">
-bash-3.2$ bosco_cluster -list
itbv-ce-pbs.uchicago.edu
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%


---## Submitting a test job
You can send a simple test job to verify that the cluster added is working correctly.

To send a BOSCO test job to the host %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain%ENDCOLOR% (name as listed in the output of =bosco_cluster --list=):
   1. Setup the environment appropriate for your shell as described in the setup environment section (above).
   1. For the cluster %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain%ENDCOLOR% (identical to output of  =bosco_cluster --list=). Replace the parts in red: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --test %RED%username@mycluster-submit.mydomain%ENDCOLOR%
</pre> %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% $ bosco_cluster -t dweitzel@ff-grid.unl.edu
dweitzel@ff-grid.unl.edu
Testing ssh to dweitzel@ff-grid.unl.edu...Passed!

</pre> %ENDTWISTY%

---## How to Stop and Remove
To stop BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_stop
</pre>

To uninstall BOSCO:<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_uninstall
</pre>


---# Job submission example

You can submit a regular Condor vanilla job to BOSCO. The Campus Factory, a component within BOSCO, will take care to run it on the different clusters that you added and to transfer the input and output files as needed.
Here follow a simple example. The Condor team provides [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/tutorials/][many great tutorials]] to learn more.
 
---## Configuring Executable
Your may wrap your job in a script (e.g. using your favorite shell or Python) so that you can invoke more executables and do some tests.

This is a simple bash script, calles =myjob.sh=: <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

# Prepare for the execution

# Run the actual applications
/bin/hostname 
/bin/date 
/usr/bin/id 
/usr/bin/whoami 
/bin/env | /bin/sort  > myout-file-$1

# Final steps
</pre>


---## Example Submission File
Here is an example submission file.  Copy it to a file, =example.condor=
<pre class="file">
universe = vanilla
output = cfjob.out.$(Cluster)-$(Process)
error = cfjob.err.$(Cluster)-$(Process)
Executable     = myjob.sh
arguments = 10
log = cfjob.log.$(Cluster)
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
queue 1
</pre>

---## Job Submission
Submit the job file =example.condor= with the =condor_submit= command: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_submit example.condor
</pre>

---## Job Monitoring
Monitor the job with =condor_q=.  For example, the job when idle is: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q

-- Submitter: uc3-c001.mwt2.org : <10.1.3.101:45876> : uc3-c001.mwt2.org
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               
  12.0   marco           7/6  13:45   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  short2.sh 10      
  13.0   marco           7/6  13:45   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  short2.sh 10

  15.0   marco           7/6  13:46   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  glidein_wrapper.sh
  16.0   marco           7/6  13:46   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  glidein_wrapper.sh
  17.0   marco           7/6  13:46   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  glidein_wrapper.sh
  18.0   marco           7/6  13:46   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  glidein_wrapper.sh
  19.0   marco           7/6  13:46   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  glidein_wrapper.sh

8 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 8 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
</pre>

*NOTE* That condor_q will show also the glidein jobs. Auxiliary jobs that BOSCO is using to run your actual job. Like in the example above, job 11 was the one submitted.

The job could be idle if it is currently idle at the remote cluster.  When the job is being executed on the remote cluster, the =ST= (State) will change to =R=, and the =RUN_TIME= will grow.

Another method of monitoring a job is to check the job's =log=, a human readable (for the most part) time line of actions relating to the job.  The =logfile= was specified in the submission script, for example =logfile= in the example above.  You can view the log file by using =cat=: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cat logfile
</pre>

---## Job output
Once the job completes BOSCO will transfer back standard output, standard error and the output files (if specified in the submit file), e.g. the job above will create stdout and stderr files (unique for each submission) and a file =myout-file-10= in the directory where the =condor_submit= command was executed.

---# Advanced use

---## Multi-User BOSCO
For multi-user BOSCO, special care must be given to enable multiple users to use the same bosco condor instance.

First, you must install the BOSCO instance just as before in the above instructions.  Second, you install a system wide condor instance.  Only the BOSCO instance will run, but it will run as root.

We will assume that BOSCO was installed as user =bosco= for the sake of this guide.

   1. As the bosco user, stop bosco: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_stop </pre>
   1. As the bosco user, edit =$HOME/bosco/local.%RED%HOST%ENDCOLOR%/config/condor_config.factory=.  Modify the ENVIRONMENT to include bosco's home directory, and add the USERID line. <pre class="file">
CAMPUSFACTORY_ENVIRONMENT = "PYTHONPATH=$(LIBEXEC)/campus_factory/python-lib CAMPUSFACTORY_DIR=$(LIBEXEC)/campus_factory _campusfactory_GLIDEIN_DIRECTORY=$CAMPUSFACTORY_DIR/share/glidein_jobs %RED%HOME=/home/bosco%ENDCOLOR%"
%RED%CAMPUSFACTORY_USERID = bosco%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
   1. As root, change ownership of the password file and start the bosco instance of condor: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% source ~bosco/bosco/bosco_setenv
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% chown root: `condor_config_val SEC_PASSWORD_FILE`
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% bosco_start</pre>
   1. As root, install Condor into a global directory.  For example, you may install the Condor RPM.  Do not start this instance of Condor.
   1. Now, as any user, you may run the test job given in [[#Validation_of_Success][Validation of Success]]



---# Troubleshooting


---## Useful Configuration and Log Files
BOSCO underneath is using Condor. You can find all the Condor log files in =~/bosco/local.HOSTNAME/log=

---## Known Issues

The current version is not supporting Condor clusters. You can add them but jobs will fail.


---## Make sure that BOSCO is running
BOSCO may not survive after you log out.
When you log back in after sourcing the setup (=source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv=), you should start BOSCO (=bosco_start=) specially if the command =condor_q= is failing.

---## Errors due to leftover files
Bosco files on the submit host are in:
   * =~/bosco/= - the release directory
   * =~/.bosco/= - some service files
   * =~/.ssh/= - the ssh key used by BOSCO

If you used =bosco_uninstall= it will remove all BOSCO related files. If you removed BOSCO by hand you must pay attention.
If the service key is still in =.ssh= but the other files are missing, during the execution of BOSCO commands you will get some unclear errors like 
_"IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/marco/.bosco/.pass'"_ , _"OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error"_ , all followed by:
<pre>Password-less ssh to marco@itb2.uchicago.edu did NOT work, even after adding the ssh-keys.
Does the remote resource allow password-less ssh?
</pre>

If that happens you can remove the service files and the keys using:<pre>rm -r ~/.bosco
rm ~/.ssh/bosco_key.rsa*</pre>
and then re-add all the clusters with =bosco_cluster --add=.
