---# Introduction
This is a quick introduction to your personal BOSCO installation. Check the [[BoSCO][main document]] to find out more about what BOSCO is and how it works. Check the [[BoscoInstall][Install document]] for detailed installation requirements and all the installation options. 

=bosco_quickstart= is a script that installs and sets up BOSCO.
The script will take care of:
   1. Installing BOSCO in =~/bosco=, if BOSCO is not already installed
   1. Connecting one cluster (submit host) with BOSCO
   1. Sending a test job to verify that the cluster is configured correctly and is working
And, =bosco_quickstart= will also suggest  what to use to submit jobs.

BOSCO is a tool to connect you to the resources you already have access to. BOSCO connects to a *submit host*. The submit host must be  a machine on which you can log in, for example with ==ssh !username@submit.mycluster.mydomain==. Given the ability to log in, you can submit jobs to a local PBS, HTCondor, LSF or SGE queue manager, for example using commands like ==qsub== and ==condor_submit==.
In this document and in BOSCO, we use the term *cluster*, because the submit host normally gives access to a set of worker nodes by way of a queue (a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster][traditional cluster]]), but sometimes it may give access to multiple resources where jobs can be queued. A cluster could even be a gateway to Cloud and Grid resources (see OSG-XSEDE in the Support section below). 

%WARNING% If you have a previous version of BOSCO installed and you'd like to install BOSCO 1.2, then you should first remove that previous version with ==source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv; bosco_uninstall --all==.

---# Install, set up BOSCO, and connect to one cluster 

With a single command you will install, set up, and connect BOSCO to one cluster. 

<!-- [[%ATTACHURL%/bosco_quickstart][quickstart script]] 
%UCL_PROMPT% wget --no-check-certificate https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/CampusGrids/BoscoQuickStart_draft/bosco_quickstart.tar.gz
-->
Download BOSCO [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/][from this download page]]. We recommend the Quickstart Multi-Platform  installer. If you prefer to work in a terminal window, you can also copy the URL that will be printed in the [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/][download page]] and use cURL:
<pre class=screen>
%UCL_PROMPT% curl -o bosco_quickstart.tar.gz ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/GET_THE_URL_FROM_THE_PAGE/bosco_quickstart.tar.gz
</pre>

Untar and invoke the ==bosco_quickstart== script from a terminal with a current working directory of the ~/Download folder or the folder in which you saved the file:
<pre class=screen>
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xvzf ./bosco_quickstart.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% ./bosco_quickstart
</pre>

If BOSCO was not previously installed, when asked "Do you want to install Bosco? Select y/n and press [ENTER])", answer "y" and press ENTER to confirm that you'd like to continue installing BOSCO. The script will print information while downloading and installing BOSCO.

The script will then ask you three questions about the cluster you want to connect to BOSCO. Follow each answer by pressing ENTER:
   * "Type the cluster name and press [ENTER]:" This is the full name of the cluster login node, for example =submit.mycluster.mydomain=
   * "Type your name at CLUSTER_NAME (default CURRENT_NAME) and press [ENTER]:" This is the =username= that you use to log in on the cluster you want to connect. If you leave this empty BOSCO will assume that it is the same as your current username on the BOSCO host
   * "Type the queue manager for CLUSTER_NAME (pbs, condor, lsf, sge, slurm) and press [ENTER]" This is the program that is used to manage the jobs in the cluster you want to connect.Examples of such programs are PBS, HTCondor, LSF, and SGE. If you don't know what is installed, ask the system administrator of the cluster.

You will then be prompted for the password that you use when logging in to the cluster that you are connecting to BOSCO. If you are using ssh keys to connect to that cluster please see the NOTE (1) below.

You are ready to submit jobs with the "condor_submit" command.
Remember to setup the environment all the time you want to use Bosco:
source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv

Here is a quickstart guide about BOSCO:
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoscoQuickStart

To remove Bosco you can run:
source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv; bosco_uninstall --all

Here is a submit file example (supposing you want to run "myjob.sh"):
universe = grid
Executable = myjob.sh
arguments =
output = myjob.output.txt
error = myjob.error.txt
log = myjob.log
transfer_output_files =
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
queue 1
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

%NOTE% (1) You must be able to login to the remote cluster. If password authentication is OK, the script will ask you for your password. If key only login is allowed, then you must load your key in the =ssh-agent=. Here is an example adding the key and testing the login: %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% eval `ssh-agent`
Agent pid 17103;
%UCL_PROMPT% ssh-add id_rsa_bosco 
Enter passphrase for id_rsa_bosco: 
Identity added: id_rsa_bosco (id_rsa_bosco)
%UCL_PROMPT% ssh  uc3@itbv-ce-pbs
Last login: Thu Sep 13 13:49:33 2012 from uc3-bosco.mwt2.org
$ logout
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%
 

%NOTE% (2) Some clusters have multiple login nodes behind a round robin DNS server. You can recognize them when you log in to the node (for example: ==ssh login.mydomain.org==), as it will show a name different from the one used to connect (for example, ==hostname -f== returns ==login2.mydomain.org==). If this happens you must connect the BOSCO resources by using a name of the host, not the DNS alias (for example: ==bosco_cluster --add login2.mydomain.org==). This is because sometimes these multiple login nodes do not share all the directories and BOSCO may be unable to find its files if different connections land on different hosts. The following example shows this: %TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_DETAILED% }%  Note how =midway-login2.rcc.uchicago.edu= must be used instead of =midway.rcc.uchicago.edu=: <pre class="screen">

Once the quickstart script completes successfully, you can remove both the script and the log file:
<pre class=screen>
%UCL_PROMPT% rm ./bosco_quickstart ./bosco_quickstart.log
</pre>

These directions will give you a personal installation of BOSCO, connected to a single resource. *To learn how to add more resources and how to customize your BOSCO installation, see the [[BoscoInstall][full install guide]].*


---## How to use BOSCO
#SetupEnvironment
Since BOSCO is not installed in the system path, a file containing environment variables must be sourced to set the variables for all BOSCO commands, such as start, stop, job submission and query.  Source the file with:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv
</pre>


---# How to submit a job
After installation, jobs may be submitted. Submission is demonstrated with a simple example.
For more examples and options, check the [[BoSCO][main Bosco document]].

Job submission with Bosco incorporates 3 items:
   1. Have an executable
   1. Prepare a submit description file
   1. Submit the job
 
---## The Executable
This example uses a bash script, called =myjob.sh=: <pre class="file">
#!/bin/bash

# Prepare for execution

# Run the actual applications
hostname 
date 
id 
whoami 


# Final steps

</pre>

Make sure that the file has permissions set such that it is executable: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT%  chmod +x myjob.sh</pre>

You may wish to run this script locally to test it and to see the output: <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT%  ./myjob.sh</pre>


---## The Submit Description File
This submit description file will submit the script as a job to the remote cluster, using the HTCondor grid universe.  Put the following into a file called =example.sub=:
<pre class="file">
universe = grid
executable = myjob.sh
arguments = 
output = output
error = error
log = myjob.log
transfer_output_files = 
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
queue 1
</pre>

This sample file contains HTCondor commands with nothing to the right of the === sign. These are commands that are not used in this example, but are included such that this sample file may be more easily used by modification on further, more complex examples.

---## Job Submission
Submit the job in the file =example.sub= with the =condor_submit= command: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_submit example.sub
</pre>

---## Job Monitoring
Monitor the job with =condor_q=.  This example shows the job in the idle state: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q

-- Submitter: uc3-c001.mwt2.org : <10.1.3.101:45876> : uc3-c001.mwt2.org
 ID      OWNER            SUBMITTED     RUN_TIME ST PRI SIZE CMD               
  12.0   marco           7/6  13:45   0+00:00:00 I  0   0.0  short2.sh 10      

1 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 1 idle, 0 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
</pre>


The job will be in the idle state if it is currently idle at the remote cluster.  When the job is being executed on the remote cluster, the =ST= (State) will be =R=, and the =RUN_TIME= will grow.

Another method for monitoring a job is to check the job's =log=, a human readable, chronologically ordered set of events relating to the job.  The =log= for this example was specified in the submit description file as named =myjob.log=.  You can view the file by using =cat=: <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% cat *.log*
</pre>

---## Job output
Once the job completes, BOSCO will transfer back to the local machine standard output, standard error and any output files specified in the submit  description file.  The example did not specify any; they would be listed within the =transfer_output_files= command. These files will be placed in the current working directory, as set when the =condor_submit= command was executed.


---# What's next
Modify the example submit description file to specify your job.

In further documentation, BOSCO jobs are the same as HTCondor jobs. More features of job submission are described on these pages about HTCondor jobs:
   * Tutorial: http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/tutorials/alliance98/submit/submit.html
   * Condor manual: http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.0/2_5Submitting_Job.html
