-- Main.DanFraser - 16 Sep 2010
---+++ The full report with links is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/CampusGridMeetings
---+++ Attendees:
   * Derek Weitzel, Brian Bockelman, Dan Fraser

---+++ Action Items:
   * Dan to invite Dan Bradley and Preston Smith to participate as representatives from the Campus Grid user community (whether or not they choose to adopt this technology for their particular implementations.)
   * Derek to update the technology document with a deployment section
   * Derek to get CPASS and DALI applications running to test the factory

---+++ Notes:
   * We discussed two different models for factory deployment:
      * Standard RPMs.
      * A simple deployment model that creates a Condor Coldstart configuration file and then uses Coldstart to automatically deploy Condor on the remote site through an SSH connection. The advantage of this model is that it does not require root access. 
      * The plan is to start with the Coldstart model.
   * Currently the only version of Condor that works with the "Blah", an essential component of the factory is the latest development version 7.5.3.
   * Accounting was discussed whereby on a central campus node there would be a campus negotiator.
   * Security (following up from last weeks discussion)
      * The Campus grids will rely completely on Condor supplied security mechanisms for user mappings. Users can be mapped either on a user by user basis or on a group basis.
      * Factories can  run under multiple accounts to provide maximal flexibility. (Although it is probably not desirable for users to run their own factories in general.)
