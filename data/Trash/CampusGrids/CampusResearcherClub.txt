---+ Campus Researcher Club

---++ Do you have science we can help with?

The Open Science Grid (OSG) advances science through open distributed computing. The OSG is a multi-disciplinary partnership to federate local, regional, community and national cyberinfrastructures to meet the needs of research and academic communities at all scales.

Perhaps your science could benefit from Distributed High Throughput Computing (DHTC), but you don’t have access to those kinds of resources at your institution. If that’s the case, our *Campus Researcher Club* may help you demonstrate that, in fact, DHTC can help your science.

---++ How does the OSG’s Campus Researcher Club work?

We will match you up with one of our member institutions to sponsor your membership. They will work with you to assess if your science truly is a good fit for DHTC. If it is, we will then provide access to the sponsor’s local DHTC resources and potentially, additional remote resources of OSG members. We will help get your application running in the local environment and help you parallelize your analysis to run effectively on our distributed resources.

---++ Who is eligible for the program?

Anyone associated with a college, university or government lab.

---++ How long may I use my sponsor’s resources?

Our program is not meant to be a long-term solution for your DHTC needs, but rather to provide a production-worthy proof of concept. Our ultimate goal is that you discover the benefits of DHTC and the positive impact it can have on your science. Then, we can help you establish a local DHTC capability at your institution for the long-term benefit of your science and that of other researchers at your institution.

---++ How much will this cost me?

There are no monetary costs. You will of course have to invest your time in working with us. We prefer to teach you to “fish” with DHTC resources, rather than “fish” for you, so you must be willing to devote the time needed to implement the best practices we teach you about running your application in a DHTC environment.

---++ What kinds of applications can run in a DHTC environment?

The OSG is primarily used as a high-throughput grid where scientific problems are solved by breaking them down into a very large number of individual jobs that can run independently. The most successful opportunistic applications run on the OSG share the following characteristics: 

   * The application is a Linux application for the x86 or x86_64 architecture. 
   * The application is single- or multi-threaded but does not require message passing. 
   * The application has a small runtime between 1 and 24 hours. 
   * The application can handle being unexpectedly killed, and restarted. 
   * The application is build from software that does not need to contact licensing servers. 
   * The scientific problem can be described as a workflow consisting of jobs of such kind. 
   * The scientific problem requires running large numbers of small jobs rather than a few large jobs. 

---++ What types of applications don’t run well in a DHTC environment?

Some characteristics of applications that do not run well opportunistically on the OSG are: 

   * The application requires message passing and a low-latency local network, e.g. applications that use MPI. 
   * The application requires a long runtime and cannot be checkpointed through signal TERM. 
   * The application workflow cannot tolerate preemptions or individual jobs crashing at remote sites. 
   * The application requires complex software and specific environments that cannot be easily met on resources. 
   * The application requires write access to a code base pre-installed at sites and shared among the worker nodes. 
   * The application requires administrator privileges for its operation. 

---++ How do I get started?

If you are from a qualifying institution and think DHTC can help advance your science, fill out our [[http://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/campus][Campus Researcher Club Request]]. We’ll be in touch after reviewing your request.
