---++ Purpose

A two hour phone call to discuss ideas for a Campus Grid workshop to be held early next year covering near term and longer (blue sky) type questions and issues involved with building campus grid infrastructure that may or may not tie into national cyberinfrasructures.

   * goals of such a workshop? 
   * who should attend? 
   * date and location


Attending:
   * Rob Gardner, Doug Olson, Brian Bockelman, Dan Bradely, Keith Chadwick

---++ Notes
   * Rob: overview/purpose
   * Brian: Nebraska: no formal funding to unify computers for a campus grid.  4 clusters, 3 are similar.  Want users to use them seamlessly.  Technologies to empower users to utilize clusters without setting up new user environments.  Same foundation, for launching onto OSG.  Would be interested in participating in a demo in cloud computing.  Interest in Globus/Nimbus.  
   * Dan: Wisconsin.  Campus grid is composed of large computing users, started out using condor.  Successful getting users on campus - but not as successful getting them onto OSG.  Highly preemptive environment for OSG users onto Glow.  Technical issues - storage technology that have worked well at the campus grid scale.  Home and user data.  Big users are okay - its the others that need a solution.  *common between Nebraska and Wisconsin*.  Eg. something like a global file system.  Issues of resource ownership:   
   *  Rob: Chicago has several small campus clusters, not integrated, separately owned. Same kinds of issues as Nebraska.
   * Keith: Fermilab - 7 clusters on site with a common site gateway; site-wide gums and authz service.  Blue Arc disk for user and application areas. dCache for storage. Batch mostly Condor.  CMS has largest cluster 8K slots.  General purpose grid 1500 slots.  CDF and D0 ~5K slots.  Issues: user jobs are transitioning from cpu to data intensive.  Filesystems - starting a program of work to investigate this, including lustre and hadoop. 
   * Fermigrid vs Nebraska - fermi seems to deal with large (HEP) collaborations, but there are smaller collaborations as well, supported within the fermilab VO (smallest is a single researcher).  VO management taken care of.  Trust document, describes how to guide organizations who may want to use the grid.
   * Support issues - fermigrid: 5 people (various FTEs). nebraska: 1 FTE (grid usage locally; question of time to engage user communities); Dan: 1 FTE to helping users
   * Doug: There is U California grid - may want to invite to this as well.
   * Doug, Magellan: R&D cloud computing in the context of sci computing investigation.  NERSC and Argonne.  Comparison of working in a cloud context versus other ways.  At SC there were discussions about collaborating w/ OSG as well as the advanced networking group.  OSG-Magellan still being defined.  Storage is an issue as well, high-bandwidth.  *Which cloud infrastructure solution?*  Eucalyptus (EC2-like interface).  Globus/Nimbus for client side cloud setup.  Timescale: hardware coming in soon; sys available early spring w/ few apps; next summer more apps. Will be setting up some initial tests with Eucalyptus and Ubuntu
   * Keith: small cloud project in-house at fermilab - benchmarking the performance of filesystems - dev and integration hosts for software developers - looking at Eucalyptus or Nimbus, though its not a complete solution, more site requirements. eg. site security requirements.  Want to put up user-friendly web interface for configuration and scheduling, and maintenance for patches, etc.

---++ Workshop organization

   * Campus Grids Face-to-Face Meeting (tentative): 1 1/2 day meeting at FNAL.  January 19-20. 
   * Participant list: Clemson, UW-Glow, FNAL, UNL, Purdue, UC, UCal-Grid, ... 
   * Next phone meeting: January 5, 2010, 12 pm CST.
   * *Action items*
      * Need to pull out a list of topics for the meeting
      * Need to have a well defined set of goals well in advance of the meeting

---++ Possible workshop topics
   * *TBD*

   1 Global storage systems (part of data management, really).
   2 User engagement strategies.
   3 Migrating users from the campus grid to national resources
   4 Cloud/virtualization strategies.

also:

   * Storage technology at the campus-grid level
   * Seamless user environments - multi-cluster, Grid, and Cloud
   * VM provisioning technical solutions - Eucalyptus, Globus/Nimbus, etc

---++ Possible workshop goals
   * *TBD*
   *  
   *
