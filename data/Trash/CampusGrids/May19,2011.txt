---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg Thain (U Wisc), Steven Cox (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Horst Severini (OU), Dan Bradley (U WIsc), Joel Snow (LU), David Swanson (UNL), Rob Quick (Indiana), Marco Mambelli (UChicago), Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * We missed a few weeks due to Condor week and vacations. 
   * Steve noted that he is starting to work with the ADCIRC folks (Brian Blanton) again.
   * Dan F. requested that we start collecting papers again from folks that have used HTPC and/or Campus grids that we can leverage for the NSF annual report. 
   * Dan B. looked to see if we were measuring HTPC usage yet. Did not find anything.  (Later analysis revealed that the sites need to run OSG 1.2.17+ in order to be using the correct probes. So our HTPC sites are being requested to upgrade their CEs.)
   * Horst noted that there has been progress on AthenaMP, now it is getting a different segfault error. 
   * Derek gave a good starting presentation on utilizing squid caches. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/CampusGrids/Apr27%2c2011/CampusGridSquid.pdf][Using HTC and Squid Caching]] We may leverage this for the upcoming Site Admin / User workshop later this year. 
   * Steve will give a presentation on his HTPC/GPU work for the next Joint HTPC/Campus HTC Infrastructure meeting.
