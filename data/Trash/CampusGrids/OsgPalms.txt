---+!! PALMS: Programs, Applications and Libraries Management and Setup
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="3"}%



---# Introduction 

PALMS (Programs, Applications and Libraries Management and Setup)
 is a system to install and manage software in a CVMFS repository such as OASIS. It simplifies the packaging and installation of a software in different versions for different platforms and it helps users to setup the correct and desired environment (applications and libraries).   With OASIS and PALMS, OSG can therefore offer not only a central location to install and store software, but also tools and procedures for VO librarians (software managers) to install and maintain the software. And once the software is distributed, PALMS will help VO users access the software.  By using PALMS the VOs will follow best practices and common guidelines set by OSG and enforced by PALMS.

PALMS is currently offered as is, it is not a officially OSG supported software or service. Anyway it is a software and a set of procedures that smaller VOs can use together with OASIS to assist with the distribution of VO application software.  This service is not mandatory, but we believe would complement greatly OASIS in significantly lower the barrier in distibuting and using software in OSG.

---# Status 
Currently PALMS is in beta. It allows to install a software in OASIS using a standard directory structure. And it allows to setup the correct software version for your current platform.

You can find the current PALMS on [[https://github.com/mambelli/PALMS][GitHub]]. Here is a synopsis of the command:
<pre class=screen>
$ ./palms -h
Usage: palms [options] command [arguments]
Options:
    -f     force install
    -d      default version
    -r DIR  root directory
    -h      help
    -u URL  tar file name

Commands:
 setup - Return a command to evaluate to setup the software
 archive - Not available
 install - Install the software in the correct place
 remove - Not available
 update - Not available
 check - Verify the PALMS installation
 version - Print the current PALMS version
 list - List the installed software in PALMS
 list-long - More verbose listing
Arguments:
 palms list
 palms -u URL install name [system [architecture [version]]]
 palms setup/archive/remove/update name [system [architecture [version]]]
</pre>

There is also an utility function =palmsdosetup= that will setup the correct environment for the selected software:
<pre class=screen>
palmsdosetup octave
</pre>

---# Availability 
If you are an OSG user you can use PALMS to setup the software intaslled in OASIS.
You can use these command whenever OASIS is available, e.g. on [[http://osgconnect.net]][OSG Connect]] or from your jobs. 
<pre class=screen>
source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg/palms/setup
palmsdosetup octave
</pre>
And if you submit your OSG jobs via HTCondor you can add a line like the following to your submit file, to make sure that OASIS is available:
<pre class=file>
Requirements = HAS_CVMFS_oasis_opensciencegrid_org =?= TRUE
</pre>

Currently installed software in the OSG OASIS repository include:

---## For software managers
If you want to use PALMS to install your own repository, then you can:
   1 Download PALMS form [[https://github.com/mambelli/PALMS][GitHub]]
   1 Install PALMS using =PALMS/install/make_setup.sh=
   1 Decide your root directory
   1. Test the commands (install, list, ... use ==./palms -h== for a list of commands)



Please add any feedback using comments in this document.

<!--
