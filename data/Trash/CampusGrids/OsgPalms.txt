---+!! PALMS: Programs, Applications and Libraries Management and Setup
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="3"}%



---# Introduction 

PALMS (Programs, Applications and Libraries Management and Setup)
 is a system to install and manage software in a CVMFS repository such as OASIS. It simplifies the packaging and installation of a software in different versions for different platforms and it helps users to setup the correct and desired environment (applications and libraries).   With OASIS and PALMS, OSG can therefore offer not only a central location to install and store software, but also tools and procedures for VO librarians (software managers) to install and maintain the software. And once the software is distributed, PALMS will help VO users access the software.  By using PALMS the VOs will follow best practices and common guidelines set by OSG and enforced by PALMS.

PALMS is a software and a set of procedures that OSG may offer to smaller VOs together with OASIS to assist with the distribution of VO application software.  This service would not be mandatory, but we believe would complement greatly OASIS in significantly lower the barrier in becoming an OSG VO.

---# Status 
Currently PALMS is in pre-alpha and is a simple script to install a software in OASIS using a standard directory structure.

Here is a synopsis of the command and you can find the current [[%ATTACHURL%/palms][script attached]]:
<pre class=screen>
$ ./palms -h
Usage: palms [options] command [arguments]
Options:
    -f     force install
    -d      default version
    -r DIR  root directory
    -h      help
    -u URL  tar file name

Commands:
 setup,archive,install,remove,update,check,version,list,list-long
Arguments:
 palms list
 palms -u URL install name [system [architecture [version]]]
 palms setup/archive/remove/update name [system [architecture [version]]]
</pre>

Please add any feedback using comments in this document.

To tests it:
   1. Download [[%ATTACHURL%/palms][palms]]
   1. Make it executable
   1. Decide your root directory
   1. Test the commands (install, list, ... use ==./palms -h== for a list of commands)
