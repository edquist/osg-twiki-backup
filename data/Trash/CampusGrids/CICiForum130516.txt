---+!! Personal HTCondor installation in a Mac Laptop

This presentation is showing in action the !MacPort of HTCondor done by Leo Singer (!CalTech). Leo introduced this way to install and setup HTCondor in a [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/presentations/SingerL_MacPorts.pdf][presentation during the Paradyn/HTCondor week]].

This demo will be specially useful if:
   * you are a researcher using HTCondor to submit your jobs or are interested in HTC
   * you have a Mac laptop (similar setups exist for Linux)
   * you can run a scaled down version of your research software on your laptop (Leo runs LIGO's software stack, but many other workflows involving R, Matlab, Mathematica, Python scripts, can all run on a Mac)

It will show:
   * how to install and configure you “Personal HTCondor” 
   * an example of testing your HTCondor work&#64258;ows in the comfort of your own laptop
      * everything is local to the laptop
      * without the need to be online (e.g. while travelling)
      * without waiting for available CPUs or shared file systems
Distributed resources are necessary to run at scale but it is often useful to run quick tests locally.


---+ Requisites
You need to have a Mac.


---+ Installation

---++ Installing !MacPort
