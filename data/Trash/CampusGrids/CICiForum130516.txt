---+!! Personal HTCondor installation in a Mac Laptop

This presentation is showing in action the !MacPort of HTCondor done by Leo Singer (!CalTech). Leo introduced this way to install and setup HTCondor in a [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/HTCondorWeek2013/presentations/SingerL_MacPorts.pdf][presentation during the Paradyn/HTCondor week]].

Leo noticed that many of his collaborators use Macs and frequently schedule and control jobs on HTCondor. This combination is common also in other Campus Grids.

This demo will be specially useful if:
   * you are a researcher using HTCondor to submit your jobs or are interested in HTC
   * you have a Mac laptop (similar setups exist for Linux)
   * you can run a scaled down version of your research software on your laptop (Leo runs LIGO's software stack, but many other workflows involving R, Matlab, Mathematica, Python scripts, can all run on a Mac)

It will show:
   * how to install and configure you “Personal HTCondor” 
   * an example of testing your HTCondor work&#64258;ows in the comfort of your own laptop
      * all locally
      * without the need to be online (while travelling)
      * without waiting for available CPUs or shared file systems
Distributed resources are necessary to run at scale but it is often useful to run quick tests locally.
