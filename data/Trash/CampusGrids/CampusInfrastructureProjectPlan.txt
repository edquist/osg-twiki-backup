---+OSG Bosco Workplan, Part I
Last update: 21-Feb-2012, BG+DF
Part of the OSG Campus Infrastructure Area

---++V0 Goal:

Provide a management tool for researchers to manage large numbers of job submissions onto their local cluster. Design goal is to manage 1000 jobs against a batch system that can only support 100 jobs running at a time. Additionally,

   * Release the V0 version of Bosco by Mar 21, 2012.
   * Dan Fraser will provide updates at the area update meetings.
   * V0 support will be provided via email to the unmoderated bosco-discuss@opensciencegrid.org email list. 

---++Researcher value proposition:

   * Universal front-end makes it easy to manage multiple job submissions 
   * Enables jobs to be submitted independent of remote batch queue size
   * We will help a researcher take a submit file that currently submits to the PBS batch system and turn it into a Bosco submit file. Help will be in the form of documentation with sample files (e.g. maybe how to run R jobs or other common applications such as GROMACS) as well as hands on support when needed.
