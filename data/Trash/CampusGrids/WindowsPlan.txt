The windows operating system is the most pervasive operating system in the world with 88% of the market share.
Linux in comparison has a 0.9% market share. However the scientific computing community has long used unix and *nix flavors for computation and sledom used Windows.

Campuses on the other end abound with windows resources within instructional labs and desktops. Therefore Windows resources represent a great computational potential if they can be harnessed and aggregated into a grid. Windows based applications (VB) or specialized software (Matlab) can be good match for such resources.

In addition, institutions without any HPC resource wanting to build a distributed system to enable science at a relatively low cost, can use their own windows instructional machines to do so without getting in the way of the desktop users.

Well known clustering and distributed system management techniques such as ROCKS, OSCAR, cfengine have not been used to build a windows grid. The Condor system has been the software of choice to harness the unused cycles of systems for decades now and can do so on windows machines as well.

To create a Windows based Grid on your campus:

   * Work with Central IT to setup a lab image that contains Condor
   * Setup a unix based Condor central manager
   * Work out the security aspects (IP restrictions, Submit machine restrictions)

There are examples of various setup to run *nix based apps under windows:

   * Cygwin
   * Co-Linux
   * VM
