The windows operating system is the most pervasive operating system in the world with 88% of the [[http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8][market share]].
Linux in comparison has a 0.9% market share. However the scientific computing community has long used unix and *nix flavors for computation and seldom used Windows.

Campuses on the other end abound with windows resources within instructional labs and desktops. Therefore Windows resources represent a great computational potential if they can be harnessed and aggregated into a grid. Windows based applications (VB) or specialized software (Matlab) can be good match for such resources.

*Motivation:* institutions without any HPC resource wanting to build a distributed system to enable science at a relatively low cost, can use their own windows instructional machines to do so without getting in the way of the desktop users.

Windows recently announced a call of Action [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2009/condor_presentations/chism-microsoft.pptx][around there HPC server 08 product]]

Well known clustering and distributed system management techniques such as ROCKS, OSCAR, cfengine have not been used to build a windows grid. The Condor system has been the software of choice to harness the unused cycles of systems for decades now and can do so on windows machines as well. For some information on Condor for windows go to [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/PCW2007/presentations/quinn_windows.ppt][this condor week 2007 talk]]

*To create a Windows based Condor pool on your campus:*

   * Engage central IT organization of your campus, or Engage faculty (depending who you are)
   * Work out the security aspects (IP restrictions, Submit machine restrictions)
   * Work out the policy restrictions (startup policies etc.)
   * Setup a unix based Condor central manager.
   * Work with Central IT to setup a lab machine image that contains Condor or use one of the alternative setup listed below.

*There are examples of various setup to run *nix based apps under windows:*

   * Cygwin (Install [[http://www.cygwin.com/][Cygwin]] )
   * Co-Linux [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/PCW2007/presentations/neeman_condorweek2007_ou_unl_colinux_20070430.ppt][in Oklahoma]]
   * VM at Marquette ([[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2009/condor_presentations/herzfeld-condor-virtualbox-windows.ppt][Using Virtual Box]])

*There are examples of Windows based Condor pools:*

   * Clemson which is also connected to the OSG([[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Education/NCGS2009Syllabus/renci-campusgrid-0509.ppt][ uses a mix of Cygwin and VM]])
   * Polytechnique Lausanne ([[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2009/condor_presentations/jermini-condorweek09.pdf][EPFL]])
   * Purdue is condorizing everything on [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/CondorWeek2009/condor_presentations/smith_cw2009_Purdue.pptx][campus]]
   * Oxford in England is also using [[http://www.oliba.uab.es/CondorWeek2008/slides/Wednesday/12_00_Spence-OxGrid-EU-Condor.ppt][Colinux]]

*To connect to the Open Science Grid:*

   * Just like any *nix resource, you will need an OSG CE, and a jobmanager that points to your windows resources. Depending on your setup the presence of a shared file system, firewall, and the sole use of windows OS may restrict the potential of use via OSG.
   * BOINC is perhaps the easiest mechanism to contribute cycles to the OSG via Condor Backfill. It allows to contribute to BOINC project that are managed by OSG VOs. Condor manages the BOINC [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.2/3_12Setting_Up.html#SECTION004129000000000000000][jobs]].
