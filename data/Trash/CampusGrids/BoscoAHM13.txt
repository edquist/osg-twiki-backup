---+!! Bosco at the OSG All Hand Meeting Demo

This is the [[https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=5610][OSG All Hands Meeting]] Bosco Demo.

---++ Getting Started

You will need to pick up a username sheet from the front of the room.  You will need the username and password for the demo later.

This is a very abbreviated install document for Bosco.  For the full install document, view [[BoscoInstall][Bosco Installer]].  

%NOTE% You will need to install Bosco on a Mac, !RedHat (Or !CentOS or Scientific Linux), or Debian computer.  It must also not have HTCondor already running.

Visit the Bosco [[http://bosco.opensciencegrid.org/download/][download]] page.  Choose the Multi-Platform Installer.  After downloading the installer, from the terminal, untar it and run the installer as a regular user:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% tar xzf boscoinstaller.tar.gz
%UCL_PROMPT% python boscoinstaller
</pre>


---++ Starting Bosco & adding your first cluster

First you will need to setup your environment to have Bosco installed:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% source ~/bosco/bosco_setenv
</pre>

Start Bosco:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_start
</pre>

Add your first cluster.  You will need your username and password from the sheet.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster --add demo%RED%XX%ENDCOLOR%@boscopbs.opensciencegrid.org pbs
</pre>


---++ Test the new Cluster

In order to confirm everything is working with the remote cluster, you may want to test the Bosco cluster.

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% bosco_cluster -t demo%RED%XX%ENDCOLOR%@boscopbs.opensciencegrid.org
</pre>

---++ Submitting your first job

For our first job, we will submit a toy job.  First, we will write the job.

<pre class="file">
#!/bin/sh
# File = bosco-job.sh
hostname
echo "It Works!"
</pre>

Be sure to make the file executable:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% chmod +x bosco-job.sh
</pre>

Next, we will write the job submit file, =bosco.submit=.
<pre class="file">
universe = grid
grid_resource = batch pbs demo%RED%XX%ENDCOLOR%@boscopbs.opensciencegrid.org
executable = bosco-job.sh
output = stdout
error = stderr
log = logfile
should_transfer_files = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
queue
</pre>

Now, submit your job:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_submit bosco.submit
</pre>

You can monitor your job with the =condor_q= command.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% condor_q
</pre>


---++ What's Next

Now that you have installed Bosco, you can begin using it to manager you computations.  Maybe you want to submit parallel jobs to a cluster, check [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/BoscoInstall#7_3_Custom_submit_properties][this]] out.
