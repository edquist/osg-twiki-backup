---++ Best Practices for Campus HTC Infrastructures

Have you developed a great way of helping your campus researchers advance their science with your campus infrastructure? If so, please consider sharing with the broader community. Don't worry about writing to meet every campuses' needs -- just tell us what you did. We are also developing a series of seminars around each practice, so let us know if you'd also be interest in presenting your best practice.
