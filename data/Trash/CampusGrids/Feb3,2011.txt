---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Shawn McKee (UMich), Steven Cox (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Brian Bockelman (UNL), Horst Severini (OU), Dan Bradley (U WIsc), Joel Snow (LU), David Swanson (UNL), Ben Cotton (Purdue), Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * We were unable to get the Campus Factory running at Purdue. This was due to PBS Pro, which we discovered is *not* supported by the BLAHP code. Derek is working with Alain on this and will also send a note to the BLAHP developers since getting this to work with PBS Pro will be important for eventual CREAM use as well. 
   * Steve was able to get the CF working at NCSA Lincoln (a PBS site) however so that he is now able to submit jobs from RENCI to Nebraska. He is continuing to experiment with this. 
   * HTPC is working well at SMU. Test jobs from HCC and GLOW ran fine. One issue is that jobs start running for a fraction of a second and then suspend until a node clears and the job resumes. Unfortunately this messes up the overall job timing since the timer starts when the job starts running. Dan B. noted that this is a feature, but that a sleep command can be issued in the job wrapper and this will work around the problem. 
   * Dan F. asked that the VDT release be held up for a week until the HTPC accounting features could be tested and included. The latest release vdt 2.0.0p24 will be released on Monday with the Gratia probe HTPC fixes for Condor, PBS, and LSF. 
   * Dan to discuss HTPC documentation in the User Guide w/Greg.
   * Steve discovered that one of his users (Brenda) is actually a clearing house for several other users to submit Amber jobs. Steve planning to help these other users.
   * Hardware has arrived. Dan B. should be handed the keys to new hardware for installing the GLOW HTPC submit host. Since Marco is currently writing documentation for setting up a Condor/GlideinWMS submit host, Dan agreed to look over and make comments on this document as he completes the process.
   * Campus Grids web page updated to reflect the current Campus Grids story https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/CampusGrids/WebHome
   * The Campus Factory has been installed at NERSC so that Nebraska submit host users can now send jobs to NERSC. 
   * Paul Avery has indicated that Florida may be a good place to set up a campus grid and is planning to set up a call with the Florida folks to get started.
   * It has been noted by the FNAL team (running LSST) that if they submit jobs through the campus grid factory at Nebraska, they will be accounted for locally at Nebraska but not in the OSG Gratia database if they are flocked to another cluster that is not on the OSG. We need a higher level discussion to think through the accounting implications in general. 
   * Since the Campus Factory is currently in a working state, Derek is pausing from further development as he is now focusing full time on writing his thesis.
