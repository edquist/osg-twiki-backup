-- Main.DanFraser - 31 Mar 2011
---++ Joint Campus HTC Infrastructure & HTPC Meeting
---+++ Attendees: 
   * Greg Thain (U Wisc), John !McGee (RENCI), Derek Weitzel (UNL), Brian Bockelman (UNL), David Swanson (UNL), Scott Teige (Indiana), Marco Mambelli (UChicago), Dan Fraser (UChicago/ANL)

---+++ Notes:
   * Indiana is setting up their Campus Grid.
   * The latest version of Condor 7.5.6 no longer requires the patch for installing the Campus Factory. Derek to update the documentation and give Scott/Rob the go ahead to continue installing.
   * The GlideinWMS front end document is ready for a wider review. Marco to ask Burt who should be reviewing from his team and invite more reviewers to work out some of the details. 
      * It will include a link to the additional setup required for enabling Campus Grid users, e.g. those with no grid credentials.
   * To incorporate HTPC capabilities into the GlideinWMS front end, the plan is to build this directly into the RPM. The doc will then need only minor updates, primarily since the one configuring will need to request HTPC to be turned on in the GlideinWMS factory. Derek is working on an updated RPM
   * Greg to produce a test case for HTPC (hopefully this afternoon). Horst and Suchandra are awaiting this to incorporate into the ITB HTPC installation testing process. Scott is also looking into creating a test case for HTPC
   * We agreed on the schema for HTPC/GPU as follows below: 
      * htpc = enabled
      * htpc_queues = queue1, queue2, queue3  # can also take "*"
      * htpc_blacklist_queues =
      * htpc_rsl = (foo=bar) # this is the default for HTPC queues
      * htpc_rsl_queue1 = (zork=quux) # this is a specialized rsl for queue1 only
      * If we need to extend this to support CREAM in the future, we can add new lines similar to the last two with CREAM syntax.
      * This will be added to the CE section of config.ini.
      * We can now pass this on to Burt
   * RENCI is in the process of setting up their GlideinWMS system (Jobs are now flowing to the STAR_BNL resource)
   * Marco is beginning to set up the Campus Factory at UChicago, should have something running in test mode this week.
