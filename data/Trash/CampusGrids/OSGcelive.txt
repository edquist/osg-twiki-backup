The OSG Live is an effort to create a streamlined installation of a OSC Compute Element. Several approaches can be taken, all with the intent to ease the installation process and provide a low barrier of entry for new sites who want to contribute resources to OSG. OSG live will constitute a minimalist software configuration that allows site to join OSG. Once site administrator have gained expertise and confidence with OSG configurations, they should setup there site using the standard OSG release.

There are several approaches being considered for OSG Live:

   * *OSG appliance*, pre-packaging of the OSG software onto a physical server.
   * *OSG virtual appliance*, pre-packaging of the OSG software onto a virtual machine image.
   * *OSG Live CD*, a Knoppix like DVD containing the pre-configured OSG software.
   * *OSG Live mini cache*, a minimalist OSG software cache.

There are several challenges that are foreseen at this time:

   * DNS name for the new CE.
   * Getting certificates for the host, pre-created or pre-loaded, this may have to remain a manual process.
   * IPtables for the site, firewall configuration will have to be dealt with.
   * Site registration through OIM, can this be scripted ?
