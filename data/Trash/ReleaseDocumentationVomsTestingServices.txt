---++ About this Document

This document demonstrates several commands that will help you test your local VOMS server. 

---++ Requirements

You need to have an installation of the VOMS client to run these commands in addition to your VOMS server that you are testing.

---++ About VOMS testing

There are several functions on the grid that access your VOMS VO:
   1. voms proxy generation through =voms-proxy-init= command
   1. grid-mapfile generation on the CE nodes
      * =edg-mkgridmap= for Grid3 authorization mode</UL>
   1. GUMS  interface for Compatibility and Full Privilege authorization modes

---++ Testing voms-proxy-init
The =voms-proxy-init= client command was included in the installation. It uses a configuration file containing the necessary arguments to access a VO's VOMS server. On the VOMS server node, this file is  located in the =$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/vomses= directory and looks like this for the =VDT= VO:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc</b>
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>ls -ld vomses</b>
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           44 Sep  4 23:03 vomses -> /usr/local/osg-voms/vdt-app-data/voms/vomses

%UCL_PROMPT% <b>cat vomses/VDT</b>
"VDT" "cms-xen3.fnal.gov" "15000" "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov" "VDT" "40"
</pre>

Tokens in the above =vomses/VDT= file:
   1. Considered a "nickname"  and , although the default is the VO name, it can be any value you desire to identify the VO you wish to get a proxy from.
   1. The hostname of the voms server
   1. Port number the server is listening on.
   1. DN of the server's VOMS certificate
   1. VO name
   1 Globus version number (which does not appear to be used anymore)

The =vomses= file syntax/values for each VO you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI of  your VO by selecting =Configuration information= on the left hand menu of the main page.

On the server, there is no need to create a =$HOME/.glite/vomses= file containing the VOMS servers you wish to access.  The =voms-proxy-init= command will search the =vomses= directory on this server for this file. 

To test the =voms-proxy-init= command, make sure that you have already added yourself as a member of the VO. As yourself (not =root= user), run the following commands:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>voms-proxy-init --voms VDT:/VDT</b>
<em>...output follows.. </em>
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase: <b><em>[PASSPHRASE]</em></b>
Creating temporary proxy ............................................... Done
Contacting  cms-xen3.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov] "VDT"  Done
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until Tue Sep  5 23:03:02 2006
</pre>
%NOTE% The "temporary proxy" it generates is the good old grid proxy.  This is used for the access to VOMS and, as it says, just temporary.


Now try one for a group you do not belong to, e.g., _/MyGroup_:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>voms-proxy-init --voms VDT:/MyGroup</b>
<em>...output follows.. </em>
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase: <b>[PASSWORD]</b>
Creating temporary proxy .......................................... Done
Contacting  cms-xen3.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov] "VDT" Failed

Error: VDT: Unable to satisfy G/MyGroup Request!

Failed to contact servers for VDT.
</pre>

%NOTE% If a subsequent attempt at a voms proxy fails, as ours did here, the previously generated proxy is still in effect. You can do another =voms-proxy-info --all= to verify this.

---++ Testing voms-proxy-info
To verify the output of the voms proxy has the extended attributes the VOMS service provides, run the =voms-proxy-info= command as shown below. The =--all= argument is important.  Without it, you will only see the basic proxy information and no extended attributes. The extended attribute and location of the proxy file are highlighted in the output:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>voms-proxy-info --all</b>
<em>... output follows....</em>
WARNING: Unable to verify signature! Server certificate possibly not installed.
Error: Cannot find certificate of AC issuer for vo VDT
subject   : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491/CN=proxy

</pre>

%IMPORTANT%  The =WARNING= and =Error= in the output above are the result of a check for an =/etc/grid-security/vomsdir= directory containing the certificate of the VOMS server you are accessing.  This is an EGEE grid requirement but __not__ an OSG grid requirement.   If you are scripting the =voms-proxy-info= command and check for the exit code, it will be non-zero.  This is a misleading as the voms proxy has been created and is valid.  A work-around for OSG sites had been provided which eliminates the 2 messages caused by this condition and also returns a zero exit code thus allowing you to script =voms-proxy-info= checking for validity, time remaining, etc, and use the exit code correctly. The work-around provides two options:
   * use of a =VOMS_PROXY_INFO_DONT_VERIFY_AC= variable set to any value you want.
   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% export VOMS_PROXY_INFO_DONT_VERIFY_AC=anything_you_want
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info --all 
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info --exists 
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info --timeleft</pre>
   * use of a =--dont-verify-ac= command line argument
   <pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info --all --dont-verify-ac
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info --exists --dont-verify-ac
%UCL_PROMPT% voms-proxy-info --timeleft --dont-verify-ac</pre>




---++ Testing edg-mkgridmap
The =edg-mkgridmap= is run on a site's Compute Element (CE) node to generated a =grid-mapfile= file.  This script is not provided as a part of the VOMS installation, so you will have to go a CE node to test this.  You do not have to be the =root= user on the CE node, but you will need to have a personal certificate available.

The =mkgridmap= file syntax/values for each VO you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI for your VO by selecting =Configuration information= on the left hand menu of the main page.

<pre class="programlisting">
group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  vdt
</pre>

%NOTE% The =.vdt= (3rd token) is an EDG format for the account name.   You will likely want to change it to the group unix account you want assigned for your CE node.  The example above is for a =group= account assignment.

To test, you will need to do this on a CE node where the authorization mode is "gridmap" (PRIMA is not enabled).

<ul>
  <li>In some writable area, create a =edg-mkgridmap.conf= file and populate it with the example configuration file on your VOMS server.  It will be the only entry.
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>echo 'group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  vdt' >./edg-mkgridmap.conf</b>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Execute the edg-mkgridmap:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
%UCL_PROMPT% <b>edg-mkgridmap --conf ./edg-mkgridmap.conf </b>
  <em>... the output will be in /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile and will look as follows ...</em>
  "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491"  vdt
  "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov"   vdt
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

---++ Testing the GUMS interface
The GUMS authorization server periodically 'pulls' the VO membership data for it's authorization and account assignment  functions from the various VO's VOMS servers.  

Unfortunately, there is no way of testing this except with an installed GUMS server which this document does not address.

See [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][Install Configure and Manage GUMS]] for more information.
