_This page outlines how to test and validate the RSV probes for SEs._

%BR%

---++ Setup
In your =config.ini= file, go to the RSV section, and change the option for =enable_srm_probes= to =%(enable)=.   Then change =srm_hosts= settings to point to your SE's gateway. Finally, set =srm_dir= to a directory on your SE that the rsv user has permissions to write to. Then turn off your vdt services on your CE, rerun =configure-osg= to configure the rsv service, and then turn on your services.

---++ Validation
In order to validate this, go to =https://<machine-name>:8443/rsv=
where =&#60;machine-name&#62;= is your CE or ( or RSV probe server that runs your rsv probes if you use a separate one).  You should see two lines =srm-ping-probe= and =srmcp-readwrite= both showing green.
