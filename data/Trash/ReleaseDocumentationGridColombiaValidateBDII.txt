---++ Validating BDII

   * Check your resource is reporting at http://gs-bdii.uchicago.edu/data/cemon_raw_incoming/ .  There should be an entry for your resource that has been updated recently (within the last 30 minutes).  If your resource has a private ip or hostname that does not resolve then, open the =UnresolvedHost= file and search for your resource name to see if it is being reported there.
   * If the information if not being reported correctly, run the following on your CE
<pre>
$VDT_LOCATION/gip/bin/gip_info
</pre>
If this information is correct, then your local GIP is configured correctly.
   * If your information is still not reported to BDII, you might have a problem with the CEMon publishing service. To troubleshoot your CEMon installation see the [[ResourceSelection.CEMonTroubleshootingGuide][CEMon troubleshooting guide]].
