%RED%Caveats from Trash.ReleaseDocumentationValidateSiteVerify:%BR%
   * this script is being phased out but still performs checks not packaged elsewhere
   * you need a valid proxy
   * the vds checks fail and can be ignored since vds has been replaced with pegasus
%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="screen">
#  <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
#  <b>source ./setup.sh </b>
#  <b>grid-proxy-init </b>
     <i>....enter your passphrase</i>
#  <b>cd verify </b>
#  <b>./site_verify.pl </b>
</pre>
