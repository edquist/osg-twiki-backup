Now you're ready to run the full CE site verification test suite. All elements of this test should now pass.

%NOTE% To run the site verify script you should not be <b>root</b> .

%RED%Caveats from ValSiteVerify:%BR%
   * this script is being phased out but still performs checks not packaged elsewhere
   * you need a valid proxy
   * the vds checks fail and can be ignored since vds has been replaced with pegasus

<pre class="screen">
#  <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
#  <b>source ./setup.sh </b>
#  <b>grid-proxy-init </b>
