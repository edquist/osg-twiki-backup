---+ Proposal for repository of upcoming software (osg-upcoming)

Underlying ticket: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-883][SW-883]]

---++ What to do in Koji

   * Make the following tags: =el[56]-osg-upcoming-{release,testing,development,build}=
   * Make the following targets: =el[56]-osg-upcoming= ( =el[56]-osg-upcoming-build -> el[56]-osg-upcoming-development= )
   * Add appropriate policies (ACLs) for various actions on the upcoming tags/targets
   * Get GOC to use mash on the new tags
   * ...

---++ What to do in SVN
   * Make =$SVN/native/redhat/branches/upcoming=
   * Add new repos to the =osg-release= rpm, disabled by default
   * ...

---++ What to do in osg-build
   * Add promotion paths to =osg-promote=
   * Add some way of making sure builds don't use the wrong target by default;%BR%
     perhaps selecting target based on SVN branch (unless otherwise specified).%BR%
     Koji can't automatically do this for us
   * ...

---++ What to do in osg-test
   * Add upcoming to our nightlies (which doubles the number of tests we run)%BR%
     Currently, our tests take under an hour to run, but are given two-hour time-slots, so this is doable.
   * Go through each of our test cases and make sure they handle which version of the software they are testing properly.%BR%
     E.g. do the hadoop tests either work with both 0.20 and 2.0.0 or at least test which one is installed and make the right configs
   * Create an =osg-tested-internal= equivalent for packages we test in upcoming;%BR%
     no need to recheck packages that haven't changed.
   * ...

---++ What to do in documentation
   * A separate SoftwareTeam.PreReleaseNotes page for packages promoted to upcoming-testing
   * An addition to SoftwareTeam.UpcomingReleases for upcoming changes to upcoming
   * Instructions on how to enable the upcoming repos that can be included in instructions for specific software much like Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories currently is
   * Instructions for specific software that we place in upcoming, e.g. hadoop-2.0.0; these should also contain migration instructions if possible
   * ...
