---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrator of a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%. It operating systems support by the OSG software.


---+ Operating System support

The operating systems supported by the OSG software release are documented on the VDT web site. It is the authoritative link and the set of supported platforms does change over time. 
   *  [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/requirements.html][VDT %VDT_VERSION% Supported Operating Systems]]

Note that &ldquo;officially supported&rdquo; means that the VDT team tests that platform on a nightly basis. It is likely to work on other similar platforms, but they are not tested. 

If you are installing on another platform, you can tell Pacman to pretend that it's one of these supported platforms. For example, if you are installing on a platform similar to !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4, you could do:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT_SHORT% pacman -pretend-platform linux-rhel-4
</pre>

The VDT documentation explains [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced#unsup_plat][how to do this in detail]].

Some common platform names for use with Pacman are:

   | *Pacman Name* | *Platform* | 
   | linux-rhel-4 | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 |
   | linux-rhel-5 | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 |

This is *not* a complete list. See the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/requirements.html][VDT %VDT_VERSION% Supported Operating Systems]] for a complete list.
