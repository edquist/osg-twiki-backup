#OperatingSystems<index entry="Operating Systems" />

The VDT Systems requirements web page for the various releases will identify the platforms supported. If you experience problems with the installation of VDT supported software or for general  system requirements the appropriate link below should be useful:
   *  [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/requirements.html][VDT %VDT_VERSION% Supported Operating Systems]]

Note that &ldquo;officially supported&rdquo; means that the VDT team tests that platform on a nightly basis. It is likely to work on other similar platforms, but they are not tested. 

If you are installing on another platform, you can tell Pacman to pretend that it's one of these supported platforms. For example, if you are installing on a platform similar to !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4, you could do:

=pacman -pretend-platform linux-rhel-4= 

The VDT documentation explains [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced#unsup_plat][how to do this in detail]].

Some common platform names for use with Pacman are:

   | *Pacman Name* | *Platform* | 
   | linux-rhel-3| !RedHat Enterprise Linux 3 |
   | linux-rhel-4 | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 4 |
   | linux-rhel-5 | !RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 |

This is *not* a complete list. See the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/requirements.html][VDT %VDT_VERSION% Supported Operating Systems]] for a complete list.
