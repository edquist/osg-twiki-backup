---+!! *Troubleshooting Document Template*
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="2"}%
%NOTE% The following sections are intended to be a super set for a Troubleshooting Document.  Particular sections may not apply to all documents, but use all the sections that make sense for your document.
%NOTE% Items in common with many troubleshooting documents should have their own page and be pointed to by or included in this document.
%NOTE% Create a new Troubleshooting document if some software or operational change requires more than a few changes to this procedure and the old troubleshooting procedure still needs to be available for use.

---++ About This Document
Note the intended user of this document

Include a brief description of troubleshooting procedure, what it applies to, and how this fits into any larger process.

---++ Common problems
List or describe the most common problems or errors that occur that would have caused the reader to be using this document.
For example:
   1. Do you have a valid proxy?
   1. Have you typed commands correctly?
   1. Are you using the right directory?
   1. Do you have access to the service?
   1. Are you authorized to use the service?
   1. Etc.

---++ Troubleshooting Procedure
Begin with a high level list of the steps involved in this troubleshooting procedure

Continue with a more detailed description of the steps the reader should take in order to eliminate possible problem areas and identify the area that is causing the the problem.   
For each step, you should have what to do, what you should expect to see, and what to do if you don't get the expected response.
Each step that requires unix commands should show the commands in a green box using 
<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

---++ If You Need Help
This should cover things the reader should do in order to get help from experts.

---+++ What information an expert will need
Identify information that anyone assisting with this problem will need and where or how the reader can get that information.

---+++ Who to contact
This should cover the best way to obtain help on this problem.  It could direct the reader to the GOC, the Integration team, a VO support center, the security team, a mailing list, or some other expert group.  Include both who and how to contact them.

---+++ References
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants to obtain more background or information.

---++ *Comments*
| Comments from my review:&#60;br /&#62;1. I bet the &#34;Who to contact&#34; will often be identical, so some boilerplate text (and perhaps a link, maybe to ReleaseDocumentation/TroubleTickets?) would be helpful. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;2. References: it would be nice to have a couple of examples, particularly for commonly used references. Good references:&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;VDT web site&#60;br /&#62;http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/&#60;br /&#62;http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Condor manual/web site&#60;br /&#62;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/&#60;br /&#62;http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.4/&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;gLite 3.1 user guide&#60;br /&#62;https://edms.cern.ch/file/722398/1.2/gLite-3-UserGuide.html&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;gLite 3.2 documentation&#60;br /&#62;http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite/documentation/R3.2/default.asp&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;3. I think it&#39;s insufficient to ask questions like &#34;Do you have a valid proxy?&#34; in Common Problems. You also need to tell users how to check. I would encourage documenters to provide specific instructions. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;4. You say &#34;The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.&#34;, but sometimes it&#39;s confusing to figure out what is a command and what is output. Are we allowed to have a single prompt character? I propose we should (it really doesn&#39;t make copy and paste hard), and we should have a consistent character: perhaps &#37; or &#62;. &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;5. You have inconsistent capitalization in your section headers.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62; | Main.AlainRoy | 08 Jul 2010 - 16:34 |
