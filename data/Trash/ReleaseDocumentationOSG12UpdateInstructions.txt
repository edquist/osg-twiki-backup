---++ Update Instructions

If you are updating from OSG 1.0.x or earlier, you must do a brand new installation because OSG 1.2.x uses a different Pacman cache from prior releases. There are installation guides for installing from scratch the various components available in ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome. In addition, for experienced admins, there is a ReleaseDocumentation.QuickInstallGuide available.

If you are updating an OSG 1.2 installation, use the =osg-version= utility to determine your OSG version:
   * If you are updating from OSG 1.2.13 or earlier, [[OSG12UpdateInstructionsPre1214][follow these update instructions]].
   * If you are updating from OSG 1.2.14 or later, [[OSG12NewUpdateInstructions][follow these streamlined update instructions]].
