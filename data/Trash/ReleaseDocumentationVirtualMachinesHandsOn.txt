---++Introduction
This session will focus on a hands on overview of different cloud technologies and how they can be useful to the OSG. We'll have a lightning talk from the STAR group about their use of Amazon's EC2 cloud to meet a paper deadline. Then admins will have the opportunity for hands on work using a Nimbus cloud and Condor's VM Universe.

---++Requirements
Attendees should have a laptop and a valid grid certificate. Attendees must send in advance their certificate DN to ayounts@purdue.edu. If an atendee does not have a valid certificate, he or she should also contact ayounts@purdue.edu so arrangement can be made.

---++More Information
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) has been used around the Internet to generally mean the running of virtual machines on someone else's hardware. When the tasks of running the physical hardware and network layer are abstracted away from administrations, focus shifts to just maintaining the machine's operating system and user applications. We will explore two different ways an OSG admin might come up against this task.

First, we explore Nimbus, a very EC2 like interface to IaaS. We will prepare a VM image, upload it to the cloud, and then create an instance of the image. We will log into the new machine, run a simple task and then shut it down. The client we will use for this task is Globus based, but the basic procedure works for any cloud, Amazon EC2 or otherwise.

Second, we explore the Condor Virtual Machine Universe. This universe allows users to deploy virtual machines on Condor reso
urces that have been enabled with virtualization technology and adds benefit over regular universe jobs for some workflows.

---++Commands
<pre class="screen">
ssh tg-condor.rcac.purdue.edu -l trainNN

ssh-keygen -t dsa # Accept default location

wget http://web.rcac.purdue.edu/~ayounts/cloud-client.tar.gz
tar xvzf cloud-client.tar.gz
cd nimbus-cloud-client-013

module load java
./bin/grid-proxy-init.sh -cert usercert.pem -key userkey.pem
./bin/cloud-client.sh --list # See VMs currently available

# For those using their own grid cert:
./bin/cloud-client.sh --transfer --sourcefile /tmp/base-cluster

# Note the "workspace" and hostname returned:
./bin/cloud-client.sh --run --name base-cluster --hours 3

ssh root@<hostname>

# Set up torque
vi /var/spool/torque/server_priv/nodes # Insert: hostname np=1
vi /var/spool/torque/mom_priv/config # Change server: hostname
vi /var/spool/torque/server_name # Insert: hostname

/etc/init.d/pbs_server start
/etc/init.d/pbs_mom start

su jobrun
qsub -I

# If there is time, there is a Globus install inside /opt for everyone to check out

logout

./bin/cloud-client.sh --terminate --handle workspaceID
