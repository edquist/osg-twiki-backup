---++ Pacman

[[WhatIsPacman][Pacman]] is a package management tool that allows you to install software. For OSG %VERSION% we rPacman %PACMAN_VERSION% is required, and the installation will fail with earlier versions.

Here we just show how to install it. To see examples, troubleshooting, info on using Pacman to remove software, and more information, see [[PacmanBestPractices][Pacman Best Practices]].

---++ Download Pacman
1. Change to the directory where you want to install Pacman. This must be separate from where you plan to install the OSG software.

2. Download Pacman %PACMAN_VERSION%.  It is available from either of the following locations:
<pre class="screen">
wget http://atlas.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-%PACMAN_VERSION%.tar.gz
</pre>
or
<pre class="screen">
wget http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/pacman/%PACMAN_VERSION%/pacman-%PACMAN_VERSION%.tar.gz
</pre>

---++ Unpack and Setup
3. Unpack the tarball:
<pre class="screen">
tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-%PACMAN_VERSION%.tar.gz
</pre>

4. Setup your environment so you can find Pacman:
<pre class="screen">
ln -s pacman-%PACMAN_VERSION% pacman
cd pacman
</pre>

For =sh= and =bash= shells:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
</pre>

For =csh= and =tcsh= shells:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.csh
</pre>
Now the pacman location is fixed in your $PATH (if you move the pacman directory, and you re-source this script, it won't fix the $PATH).
