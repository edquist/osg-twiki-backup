    <ul>
      <li>Email to Preston -- has called in expert help at their end to make sure shared-lib dependencies are available.</li>
      <li>Status email to Gabriele about Iter -- try to arrange meeting next week.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Apparently the Geant4 GUMS mapping triggered a bug in GUMS. Mapping has been changed to work around, fix is in process.</li>
      <li>Attempt to trace Purdue/CAESAR job failure during exec stage. Basic globus-job-run to pbs queue doesn't work either. Preston is investigating.</li>
      <li>Attempt to run at NERSC/JACQUARD -- initial failure eventually turned out to be missing DLL -- fixed with compile including static instead of dynamic ACML libraries.</li>
      <li>More info: globus-job-run didn't work because of missing jobType="single" clause. MPI problem is starting to look like a missing DLL (libintlc.so, for which there is no corresponding .a library, precluding the workaround of a static install).</li>
      <li>Strange transient errors submitting to local condor client. fd limits? Mail to Steve.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Long discussion with Gabriele on Iter, Geant4 and EC2:
      <ul><li>Current state of Iter: have a v1.0 working. Need to add another site to prove it -- Purdue, maybe.</li>
          <li>Need to write down current issues.</li>
          <li>Need to have conference on next steps -- may need to understand exec better and/or make changes.</li>
          <li>Geant4 -- no word in a week. Discussed problems. Not sure how to proceed with EC2 investigations -- need to think.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>Review tickets:
        <ul><li>NYSGRID_CORNELL_NYS1 can be resolved.</li>
            <li>BNL ticket is waiting addition of mapping.</li>
            <li>ISUHEP is waiting on change to OIM entry.</li>
            <li>NWICG is resolved, apparently.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Compile tgyro on jacquard@NERSC (module load acml) and Purdue-CAESAR (module load mpich2-intel, new make.{inc,ext}.CAESAR scripts).</li>
        <li>Add menu items to OSG submit hooks. Submit test jobs.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Ping to Jeff Candy of Iter including current progress and plans. Still waiting for response to problem of exec not terminating properly.</li>
      <li>Successful remote run on NERSC. Ready to run on other sites as soon as I have a compiled version for each site.</li>

      <li>Discussion with Keith on LQCD Gratia: project (-A) is not even scraped by EGEE probe: would need to add it to probe, upload as Resource and add to summary table. Probably also add to !VONameCorrection in order to take into account for reporting name. Most of this is trivial and can be "sneaked in" to a release. The reporting name translation code may be more work as it might involve making the translation code use hibernate properly.</li>
      <li>Discover missing XML file backups from enstore. Fix and improve backup script to upload XML files for missing month. Run backups for gr8x_n_ collectors for this month and last.</li>
