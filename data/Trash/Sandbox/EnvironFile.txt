charmmJob.sh (Environ-File)

Exports a bunch of variables like PYTHON_PATH, PYTHON_URL, inurl (code repository location), runcharmm (job specific script that is used to set-up the execution environment and also invokes the job-specific executable), exe (job-specific executable), outurl (location where output files should be finally stored), jobname (Current job name), inpname (Input job name), resfile (restart file), inpscript (input script name) etc that are inputs to the job submission code. Finally, executes charmmJob.py (Job-Sub-File).
