      <li>Talk to Bruno Goncalves about execution time constraints and manual check-pointing for longer jobs. Master-worker package from condor? Got !ReSS configuration details for client and details on master-worker.</li>
      <li>Talk to Mats about !ReSS, packing meta-scheduler, etc. Meta-scheduler being packaged for nanoHUB but needs to have some Engage-specific things taken out. Mats has no real ties to ReSS -- it does the job right now; but doesn't see what Miron's direct !ClassAd approach would provide that !ReSS does not.</li>
      <li>Last words with Alan -- will get TIGRE into the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package and try to identify users / apps who would benefit from using OSG. Some apps need licenses, etc. but there should be something.</li>

      <li>Bio workshop.
        <ul><li class="todo">Jim Schaff, !CompBioGrid: concentrating on !VCell application. Not MPI, so should be easy. Start contacts on pushing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo uptake and tests. !ReSS on client?</li>

      <li>Chat to Greg T., Tim Miller and Preston S. over lunch. Need to get MPI ring test from Greg and download Intel MPI benchmarks to have a simple app to run under MPI following Greg's instructions.</li>
      <li>Chat to Brian Tierney about site-local grid-file collection and possible use of Gratia to store information about location of log archive relevant to a job. Afterwards, sent email suggesting that GIP / !ReSS might be a better place for the information.</li>
      <li>Look into gums-host-cron and other problems at Nebraska.</li>
      <li>Added existing site test results for OSG and OSGEDU VOs to site-tests documentation page.</li>
      <li>CampusGrid session. Talked to Alan afterwards about TIGRE and prospects for allowing TIGRE jobs to make it out to the OSG. Some points:
        <ul><li>Most TIGRE jobs are GT4. Would need to either bridge or </li>
            <li>Currently don't do voms-proxies (although TIGRE has a populated VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS). Could change? Easy (replace grid-prox-init with a wrapper around voms-proxy-init)?</li>
            <li>All TIGRE jobs from same CA, now accredited by IGTF.</li>
            <li>Meta-scheduling within TIGRE uses GridWay, part of globus since 4.0.5</li>
            <li>Chat to Anne about VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo pages -- scrap the TWiki matrix and move to grouped links?</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Chat to Mats about osg-vo-tests -- promised to look at it.</li>

      <li>Talk to Xin about resource labeling. OIM will not solve the problem of heterogeneous-ownership clusters. Xin claims that many campus grids work the same way, so it's more common than we've been led to believe so far.

      <li>Talk to Xin about status for Glexec probes -- need to be able to provide poll-type info for all probes in a cluster, including individual info for a probe.

      <li>Diagnose and fix problem trying to decode overlong records. Records are many-node parallel jobs utilizing the "buggy POST" code. Remediated by doing buffer loop up to 10 chunks of 16K. Problem will go away as new probes make it out into the wild.</li>
