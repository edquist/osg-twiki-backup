<h3>User Support</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>2007/06/08</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Local discussions with Dave D. and Dan Y. about SQUID and !IceCube data transfer problem. Sent queries to Juan Carlos.</li>
      <li>Back and forth with Juan Carlos: for simulation, individual files are only about 3.5MB in size (uncompressed); and are loaded in 800MB chunks. 14GB is a reasonably large cache, but apart from that seems custom-made for a SQUID cache. Keith says environment variables in OSG job should specify whether SQUID cache is available.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/06/07</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Attended User Support meeting with Juan Carlos and a grad student, John.</li>
      <li>Discussion with DY and student about classAds and discovery.</li>
      <li>User Support meeting minutes.</li>
      <li>Asked Keith about SAZ and WS for OSG 0.8; not a high priority, but SAZ pre-WS should still work provided the previous proxy problems have been overcome. Need to test.</li>
      <li>Thanked Matt C. for help with DOEGrids discussion yesterday. He had a further suggestion: some people (eg Keith) have authority to approve a signing request essentially for a new type of cert that DOEGrids can't turn down: should discuss with Keith.</li>
      <li>Asked Steve whether !CondorG / WS question was raised at this morning's Condor 'phone meeting. It was not, so I'll put together an email for Steve to forward to =condor-admin=.</li>
      <li>Talked to Matt and Keith about robots certs; replied to DOEGrids/GOC thread and asked Keith to bring up the subject at the OSG security meeting.</li>
      <li>Asked =fermigrid-operations= about site-local caching of large data files (~14G) used by jobs (on behalf of !IceCube).</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/06/06</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Got publishing working properly and sent email to Ruth, Nickolai and Mats</li>
      <li>Put more session information into Indico.</li>
      <li>Arranged with Juan Carlos to attend User Support meeting.</li>
      <li>Agenda for meeting.</li>
      <li>Request to DOEGrids and GOC for robots cert; chaos ensues.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/06/05</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Responded to erroneous =osg-users= email.</li>
      <li>Installed new DOE cert; tested with =globus-job-run=; OK.</li>
      <li>Discussed footprint reduction with !MiniBooNE: looks encouraging.</li>
      <li>Minor tweaks and ran tests for Engage, SDSS and DES.</li>
      <li>Wrote publishing script.</li>
      <li>Published tests to =user-support.opensciencegrid.org=.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/06/04</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Helped Suchandra with FNAL ticket background to Steve Clark's nanoHUB problem.</li>
      <li>Attended troubleshooting meeting.</li>
      <li>Asked about status propagation problem: WONTFIX on GT2, but status propagation and global job ID are both available on WS. Need to ask Condor team about whether !CondorG can cope with this GT4 feature yet. Pass on to Steve for Thursday's 'phone meeting.</li>
      <li>News from Trash/Troubleshooting team about a bug in =xinetd= only seen when running =gsiftp= under =xinetd= and client and server are either side of a firewall. Talk to Fermigrid team about getting a kosher build of =xinetd= into FSL?</li>
      <li>Talked to Steve and Neha about more !MiniBooNE failures over the weekend -- eventually traced to possible problem with jobmanager feature installed for LIGO and its interaction with CMS.</li>
      <li>Attended Grid users' meeting. Talked about July workshop. Suggestion to have evening dinner at Chez Leon -- will investigate. Also talked about CDF problem: reluctant to relax the configuration -- have asked Chris P and Steve B to do another COMMON block footprint survey to try to shrink the exec.</li>
      <li>Talked to Nickolai: very keen on having site tests -- should be able to produce tomorrow.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/06/01</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Fielded question from Forrest about grid school documentation.</li>
      <li>Helped diagnose a GRID problem for !MiniBooNE: turned out to be !GridFTP problems on their servers that had been hidden until the power outage yesterday; Mark Schmitz fixed.</li>
      <li>Completed addition of batch timeout feature to =gridSiteTest= script, including testing.</li>
      <li>Finished implementation of internal use of VORS module to generate site list for specified VO: eliminated need for =vors_list= script entirely.</li>
      <li>VORS module now saves data in a more efficient way, and prints the detail set in a slightly more readable format.</li>
      <li>Fixed problem in job output handling introduced when internal data format was rationalized and made consistent.</li>
      <li>Notified EB and !UserGroup about minutes.</li>
      <li>Mailed Forrest and Anne to ask about format problems caused by attaching !TWiki pages to emails with Thunderbird.</li>
      <li>Put in helpdesk ticket #98419 for untimely demise of =osg-user-group@opensciencegrid.org= mailing list.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/05/31</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Obtained User Group Coordination list address; added me, Abhishek, Frank and Torre; and Ruth.</li>
      <li>Sent out announcement to all lists.</li>
      <li>Rationalize and internally comment =gridSiteTest= script and add batch timeout feature.</li>
      <li>Attended !UserGroup meeting; wrote minutes.</li>
      <li>Fielded question from Suchandra about nanoHUB ticket -- can't access remedy right now. Suggested asking Steve C. for more clarification.</li>
      <li>Followed up on =glexec= question from meeting this morning: should be in VDT1.7.0.</li>
      <li>Had Dan Y. hold Chris P.'s jobs on fnpcsrv1 prior to !MiniBooNE server shutdown to ease recovery procedures for !MiniBooNE.</li>
      <li>Talked to Gabriele about !MiniBooNE's latest problems.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2005/05/30</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>More info from Chris P. about !MiniBooNE's Fermigrid failures allowed us to ascertain (much help needed from Steve since Condor Status email showed status 0!) that the jobs were being killed CDF's machines due to a =SYSTEM_PERIODIC_REMOVE= clause restricting image size to <2GB. Modified =multisim= to insert =globusRSL= to prevent Fermigrid jobs matching to CDF for now, and sent a plea to Rick Snider at CDF for exemption from the restriction for !MiniBooNE</li>
      <li>Requested that issue of lack of status propagation in !CondorG be brought up in tomorrow's condor meeting -- was informed by Igor S. that this is actually a GRAM limitation, but not known whether this is GT2 only or WS too.</li>
      <li>Actually got to _look_ at =osg-vo-test= code today -- maybe I can even work on it tomorrow!</li>
      <li>Updated announcement info on Indico and started adding session info. Waiting for inauguration of requested =osg-user-group@opensciencegrid.org= mailing list before sending out email.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2005/05/29</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Spoke to Steve T. about Chris Polly's authorization problems. Made a change to e898dev's login. Waiting for feedback from Chris P.</li>
      <li>Spoke to Burt H. about globus-url-copy problems - unable to reproduce now; check with Chris P.</li>
      <li>Attended [[Trash/DocsComm.DocProjectMinutes29May07][Trash/DocsComm meeting]].</li>
      <li>Solved both of Chris P.'s problems in one shot: turns out to be the invocation of myproxy in his .bashrc, complete with setting of various environment variables. Haven't ascertained *exactly* which part of this causes the problem because the whole block is superfluous now.</li>
      <li>Fixed registration form for users' meeting to remove references to site meeting (Keith reported). Still need to announce.</li>
      <li>More trouble with Chris' jobs to Fermigrid this afternoon -- _argh_! Didn't submit with -N so don't have enough diagnostics. Asked him to resubmit with -N. Will know more tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Email from Shaowen following on Mats' problems of last week: replied pointing him to !UserGroup minutes detailing resolution -- no troubleshooting necessary.</li>
      <li>Minutes of last Thursday's User Support meeting done. Also sent email cc'd to EB regarding this and final draft of announcement.</li>

      <li>Started VMs this morning on all Gratia machines after Jeff noticed they hadn't come back after the outage.</li>
      <li>Fixed bug in tomcat init script which led to failure to start up or shutdown when invoked by the system at boot or shutdown -- interactive invocations worked just fine.</li>
      <li>At Philippe's request, checked into why !MySQL did not start on =gratia-db01= when it rebooted. According to my investigations, it did. Will check with Philippe Monday.</li>
      <li>Helped Margherita with a problem making changes and updating =.war= files.</li>

  </dd>
  <dt>2005/05/29</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Lunchtime conversions with Philippe and Keith over backup and other DB problems: will probably swap to INNODB table engine: allows transactions (will need these) and also does not need to lock table during queries (one reason for slow report performance). Also chatted about schema migration.</li>
      <li>Continued INNODB conversation over IM.</li>
      <li>Sent email asking whether we should have a GRAM auditing meeting this week: consensus seems to be no.</li>
