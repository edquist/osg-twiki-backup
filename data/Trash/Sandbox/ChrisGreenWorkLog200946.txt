      <li>Apply VM memory config changes to gr8xN. Shouldn't be any more memory troubles, but still slow. With Philippe, investigate and identify as N:1 problem: each replication entry is its own thread -- lots of replication threads will beat out the processing thread.</li>
      <li id="CD">Report broken pager; borrow Dan's.</li>
      <li>Investigate apparent instance of, "collector-killer" record on gr8x0. Identify as test condor-boinc probe being sent to production. Malformed record is apparently managing to trip up the bad record mitigation. Find records, remove from queue and ban probe in Connections admin page. Send records to Philippe for investigation and fix. IM with Brian on subject.</li>
      <li>Based on report from John and email thread: in !DistinguishedName summary column (and therefore sent to OSG) we're seeing instances of DN:FQAN. According to Brian, this is a "feature" of newer versions of Condor changing the semantics of the !X509USERPROXYSUBJECT !ClassAd entry. Discussions.</li>
