---++ Installation

If you installed the Generic-Information-Provider (GIP) prior to June 17th and are having problems getting the full GIP output for condor, then it would be worthwhile to update your GIP installation using pacman.

<pre>
&gt; <b>pacman -update Generic-Information-Provider</b> 
</pre>

Source your preferred setup file (setup.sh or setup.csh)

<pre>
&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b> 
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; <b>./vdt/setup/configure_gip</b> 
</pre>

<pre>
We have set up the Generic Information Providers (GIP) as much as we can,
but there is some stuff that we cannot do. To complete the process edit
/opt/itb/lcg/var/gip/lcg-info-generic.conf to contain information about
your site. Then run the following command, and everything should be set.
Note that it is important to give the full pathname for the argument to
lcg-info-generic-config
</pre>

Edit $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/lcg-info-generic.conf

<pre>
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/sbin/lcg-info-generic-config $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/lcg-info-generic.conf</b>
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; <b>/etc/init.d/gris stop</b>
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; <b>/etc/init.d/gris start</b>
</pre>
