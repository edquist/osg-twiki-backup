          <li>New feature "multi-match" to results to replace earlier imperfect attempt to guess from the structure of the match clause.</li>
          <li class="todo">Almost-working "--remake-summary" option to re-do results without re-doing the work to get there. Will need to implement a more intelligent restore in some of the modules. More thought needed.</li>

          <li>Re-ordered OSG tests to cut out doomed-to-fail-but-only-after-a-very-long-time =globus-url-copy= attempts.</li>

          <li class="todo">Will need to clean up old directories in AFS area to avoid clutter.</li>
