---+ OSG IPv6 Compatibility of Operations and Software Components 

The following is a table listing the services provided by the OSG Operations Center and denoting whether they are known to be compatible with IPv6.

%TOC{depth="2"}%

---++ About This Document

This document is intended to track the progress of the OSG Operations Center's transition from IPv4-only to IPv6-compatible services.  It should show at a glance which services need to be tested or made compatible (or replaced with equivalent compatible software).

---++ Definition of IPv6 Compatibility

One cannot properly state whether a service is "IPv6-compatible" without defining exactly what that means.  Here is the definition that this document will use.

Here at the OSG Operations Center, we will soon be configuring every machine, physical and virtual, so as to be "dual-stacked," with an IPv6 network stack added in addition to its existing IPv4 stack.  Each machine's network interface will thus have at least one IPv6 address on which it listens, in addition to whatever IPv4 addresses it is already listening on.  In this way we can continue to maintain each service at its current IPv4 address while adding the ability to also provide service via IPv6.  The system's routing table should be able to direct packets appropriately, and the DNS resolver routines should be able to properly look up both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  However, if the service's software is, in one way or another, written with the assumption that the only IP addresses will be IPv4 ones, it is likely to be incompatible with IPv6.

At the time of writing this, the OSG Operations servers are not yet all fully dual-stacked, but that is not what this table signifies.  For the purposes of this document, if a service could respond properly to requests from an IPv6 client if it were installed on a dual-stacked host of the sort that all OSG Operations machines will soon be, it is IPv6-compatible.  That is, the contents of this table refer to the IPv6 compatibility of the service and its software, not of the host or operating system.

---++ Legend of Compatibility Keywords

Under the "IPv6 Compatibility" column in the table below you'll see certain keywords.  These are their meanings.

   * %IPV6_YES%: We at OSG Operations have tested this service and found it to be IPv6-compatible to our satisfaction.
   * %IPV6_YESBUT%: We have tested this service and found it possible to use under IPv6, but there are shortcomings — special requirements on the client side, nonstandard OS configuration, an inability to be simultaneously IPv4- and IPv6-compatible, not all features IPv6-compatible, etc.
   * %IPV6_CLAIMED%: We have not yet tested this service, but someone else that we feel has some knowledge of the matter (perhaps at another site on the OSG, perhaps the software's developers) claims that it is IPv6-compatible.
   * %IPV6_NO%: We have tested this service and found it not to be IPv6-compatible, at least not as it is currently installed.
   * %IPV6_UNKNOWN%: To our knowledge, no one has tested this service for IPv6 compatibility yet.
