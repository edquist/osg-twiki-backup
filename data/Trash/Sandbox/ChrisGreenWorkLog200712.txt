  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Attended Gratia meeting.</li>
      <li>Removed more offending entries from DB.</li>
      <li>Status page can now return last-seen probe info for all sites at once.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/05/15</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Discussions with Jeff about DB access -- cleared with Steve Timm and opened up Gratia user DB access to whole of FNAL site.</li>
      <li>Requested more software on development machines (xemacs, KDE, daily slocate updates).</li>
      <li>Back and forth with Steve T.: will have to move a bunch of stuff off AFS to continue working on the Gratia machines since they can't handle AFS with the Xen kernels).</li>
      <li>Some *very* fiddly SQL edits to summary tables to fix OU record trouble. Definitely need triggers to handle this. After too long, decided to rebuild the summary tables anyway.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2007/05/14</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Was asked by Philippe to bring =gratia-vm02= collectors and DB online quickly to allow Jeff to operate again. Trouble, trouble, trouble. Took most of the day to get mysql and tomcat talking nice to each other. Set replicators going from default instances to development instances. Modified access rights to lock most people out: will need to install mysql GUI tools on gratia machines.</li>
      <li>Installed new "fermi-specific" collectors on =gratia08=: will be initial destination for local info before replication to OSG collectors. Started and waiting.</li>
      <li>Installed MySQL GUI tools on development machines and =gratia-db01=.</li>
      <li>Turned off replication to development collectors because production collectors ran out of heap space -- will need to be careful of this.</li>
    </ul>
