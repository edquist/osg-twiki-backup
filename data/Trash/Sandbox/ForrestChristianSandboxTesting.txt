This is typically done by your experiment&#8217;s Enstore liaison. Most users do not have permissions to change permissions and ownership.

The permissions shown in the output of the enstore pnfs --tags command (see [[EnstorePnfsNamespace#HowtoViewTags][How to View Tags]]) indicate whether you can change the value of the tag or not. To change a tag, you need to use the [[EnstoreCommands#EnstorePnfs][enstore pnfs]] command with one of the options --tagchown or --tagchmod to change ownership or permissions, respectively. For example, to add write permission for &#8220;other&#8221; to the permissions for the file family tag, you&#8217;d enter (include the quotes):

%H_____2% Introduction

Regular expressions (REs), unlike simple queries, allow you to search for text which matches a particular pattern.

REs are similar to (but more poweful than) the "wildcards" used in the command-line interfaces found in operating systems such as Unix and MS-DOS. REs are used by sophisticated search engines, as well as by many Unix-based languages and tools ( e.g., awk, grep, lex, perl, and sed ).

This is typically done by your experiment&#8217;s Enstore liaison. Most users do not have permissions to change permissions and ownership.

The permissions shown in the output of the enstore pnfs --tags command (see [[EnstorePnfsNamespace#HowtoViewTags][How to View Tags]]) indicate whether you can change the value of the tag or not.

---BASEHEADINGLEVEL+ Examples
%H______3% Examples

compan(y|ies) 	Search for company, companies
(peter|paul) 	Search for peter, paul
bug* 	Search for bug, bugg, buggg or simply bu (a star matches zero or more instances of the previous character)
bug.* 	Search for bug, bugs, bugfix (a dot-star matches zero or more instances of any character)
[Bb]ag 	Search for Bag, bag
b[aiueo]g 	Second letter is a vowel. Matches bag, bug, big
b.g 	Second letter is any letter. Matches also b&g
[a-zA-Z] 	Matches any one letter (but not a number or a symbol)
[^0-9a-zA-Z] 	Matches any symbol (but not a number or a letter)
[A-Z][A-Z]* 	Matches one or more uppercase letters
[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4} 	US social security number, e.g. 123-45-6789
PNG;Chart 	Search for topics containing the words PNG and Chart. The ";" and separator is TWiki-specific and is not a regular expression; it is a useful facility that is enabled when regular expression searching is enabled.

%H____3% Searches with "and" combinations

    * TWiki extends the regular expressions with an and search. The delimiter is a semicolon ;. Exam
