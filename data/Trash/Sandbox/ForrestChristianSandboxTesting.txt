This is typically done by your experiment&#8217;s Enstore liaison. Most users do not have permissions to change permissions and ownership.

The permissions shown in the output of the enstore pnfs --tags command (see [[EnstorePnfsNamespace#HowtoViewTags][How to View Tags]]) indicate whether you can change the value of the tag or not. To change a tag, you need to use the [[EnstoreCommands#EnstorePnfs][enstore pnfs]] command with one of the options --tagchown or --tagchmod to change ownership or permissions, respectively. For example, to add write permission for &#8220;other&#8221; to the permissions for the file family tag, you&#8217;d enter (include the quotes): 

ntroduction

Regular expressions (REs), unlike simple queries, allow you to search for text which matches a particular pattern.

REs are similar to (but more poweful than) the "wildcards" used in the command-line interfaces found in operating systems such as Unix and MS-DOS. REs are used by sophisticated search engines, as well as by many Unix-based languages and tools ( e.g., awk, grep, lex, perl, and sed ).
