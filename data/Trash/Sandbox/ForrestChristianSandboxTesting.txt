There are three types of users:
   1. _Experimental Principal or Application Owner:_ Someone in charge of the experiment. This person normally oversees the application development for the experiment. These people need developer material which does not exist. They will be either developing a new application to run on the grids or attempting to port over an existing application. For a variety of reasons explained below, this is non-trivial.
   1. _Researcher using the official VO application in the officially sanctioned manner:_ 
      A. _VO-Specific Documentation:_ If the VO has their own interfaces for submitting and managing jobs (e.g., CMS) this user requires VO-specific materials which by definition is out of scope for us.
      A. _Generic VO Documentation:_ A basic instruction set that explains how to use particular grid tools (no variance) in set ways to submit jobs and receive results. No development or porting of the application is included. To be based on the Grid School materials. This includes how to discover where you can run  your job and running your test suite. It does not cover how to create a test suite for your application.
   1. _Researcher *not* using the official VO application or not using it in the officially sanctioned manner:_ This researcher is much like the Experimental Principal and requires developer documentation on how to port applications, create test suites to ensure that the site can actually run your application.

---++ Generic OSG VO Guide
This process assumes that you have:
   1. [[Documentation.CertificateGet][Obtained and maintained a valid client certificate]] from an OSG-trusted Certificate Authority.
   1. Registered successfully in an OSG-affiliated [[Documentation.VOWhatIs][Virtual Organization]].
   1. Ported an existing application to parallelization or created a new parallel application for running on the grids.
   1. Access to a working interface to the OSG with the appropriate [[ReleaseDocumentation.0_4_1.ClientInstallationGuide][client software installed]].
   1. Documented the IO interface requirements for your application.
   1. Documented the environment requirements for your application.
   1. [[ForrestChristianCanIRun][Have determined that you can run your application on this site.]]
