%BHL% Introduction
Regular expressions (REs), unlike simple queries, allow you to search for text which matches a particular pattern.

REs are similar to (but more poweful than) the "wildcards" used in the command-line interfaces found in operating systems such as Unix and MS-DOS. REs are used by sophisticated search engines, as well as by many Unix-based languages and tools ( e.g., awk, grep, lex, perl, and sed ).

This is typically done by your experiment&#8217;s Enstore liaison. Most users do not have permissions to change permissions and ownership.

%BHL%+ Examples

| compan(y|ies) |  Search for company, companies |
| (peter|paul) | Search for peter, paul |
| bug* | Search for bug, bugg, buggg or simply bu (a star matches zero or more instances of the previous character) |
| bug.* | Search for bug, bugs, bugfix (a dot-star matches zero or more instances of any character) |
| [Bb]ag | Search for Bag, bag |
| b[aiueo]g | Second letter is a vowel. Matches bag, bug, big |
| b.g | Second letter is any letter. Matches also b&g |

%BHL%+ Examples Searches with "and" combinations

    * TWiki extends the regular expressions with an and search. The delimiter is a semicolon ;. Exam
