---+!! Using !UberFTP as your !GridFTP-Enabled Client



%STARTINCLUDE%
According to the [[http://dims.ncsa.uiuc.edu/set/uberftp/index.html][UberFTP site at NCSA]],

%STARTInsetBox%
!UberFTP is the first interactive, !GridFTP-enabled ftp client. It supports GSI authentication, parallel data channels and third party transfers.
%ENDInsetBox%

!UberFTP comes in the OSG Software package as one of the [[Documentation.StorageGridFTP][GridFTP]]-enabled clients.

%BHL%+ !UberFTP Commandline Options
	
Usage: 
   * uberftp [-?] [-d] [ host [-P port] [-a auth] [-c N] [-t type] ]
   * uberftp [-?] [-d]  host  [-P port] [-a auth] [-c N] [-t type] "cmd"
   * uberftp -v

| *Option* | *Description* |
| =host= | Connect to host |
| =-P port= | Connect to port (default 2811 for GSI) |
| =-a auth= | Use auth authentication. GSI and MSS (NCSA passwordless) authentication methods are supported. If this option is not used, the default is GSI |
| =-c N= | Use N parallel data connections. Defaults to 1. |
| =-t type= | Use ASCII or BINARY transfer type. Valid type options are 'a' (ASCII) or 'b' (BINARY). Default is BINARY. |
| =cmd= | This specifies the FTP commands to run once the control connection is establish. This list must be enclosed in quotes. Multiple commands are semicolon delimited uberftp will execute these commands and then exit. |
| =-v= | Print version information and exit. |
| =-?= | Print this help message |
| =-d= | Turn on debug (verbose) output |

							
   $ %H% *%ORANGE% NOTE %ENDCOLOR%*: As of version 1.7, =-u user= and =-p pass= are no longer supported. %BR% =-H host= is now optional: you can just specify =host=. The =-H= switch is supported for backwards compatibility. It will will be removed in version 2.

%BHL%+ Interactive Commands
!UberFTP supports the following commands (type =help= at the command prompt to list):

<table style="valign: top;"><tr style="valign: top;"><td>
   * ascii
   * binary
   * blksize
   * cat
   * cd
   * chmod
   * debug
   * close
   * dir
   * get
   * hash
</td><td>
   * help
   * lcat

   * lchmod
   * lls
   * lclose
   * lmkdir
   * lopen

   * lrmdir
</td><td>
   * lquote
   * ls
   * mget
   * mput
   * mkdir
   * mode
   * passive
   * open
   * parallel
   * pget
   * pput
</td><td style="valign: top;" valign="top">
   * pwd
   * put
   * rm
   * rmdir
   * quit
   * quote
   * tcpbuf<sup>[[#FootNoteTcpbuf1][1]]
</td>
</tr></table>

#FootNoteTcpbuf1
   1. =tcpbuf= was added in version 1.8.


%BHL%+ Configuring Your Environment for !UberFTP
[[http://dims.ncsa.uiuc.edu/set/uberftp/index.html][UberFTP]] is typically dynamically linked. Normally, you must configure your environment so that the client can locate all of its needed libraries. 

The following error message means that your environment has not been configured for !UberFTP: 
<pre>    uberftp: error while loading shared libraries: 
        libglobus_ftp_control_gcc64pthr.so.0: cannot open 
        shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>

%BHL%++ To Configure your environment: 
   1. Set =GLOBUS_LOCATION=: <pre> > export GLOBUS_LOCATION=/usr/local/globus</pre>
   1. Source =$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh=: <pre> > . $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh</pre>

%BHL%+ Performing Normal Transfers
In normal data transfers, the "local" machine is the one on which you are running the command. 
   1. Use =open= to select the remote host.
   1. Perform =put= and =get= between the local client machine and the remote FTP service. 


%BHL%+ Third-Party Transfers
Since third-party transfers involve two remote sites, you must first set one as a "local" service, and then use =get= and =put= in the right direction.
   1. Use =lopen= to select a remote host as a new "local" service. All =l*= commands can now act on the new "local" service as if you were logged into that machine.
   1. Use =put= to perform a third-party transfer where you are moving the file from the "local" service to the "remote" service. 
   1. Use =get= to move a file from the "remote" service to the "local" service". 
   1. When you have completed the data transfers, use =close= with the "local" service and =lclose= with the "remote" service. 


%BHL%++ To start a session using GSI authentication:
   1. Obtain a current grid proxy using =grid-proxy-init=.
   1. Use !UberFTP to access the remote server.
   1. Run your commands.
   1. Close the connection.
   
Here's an example of starting a session using GSI authentication:

  Aug 18 2003   There may be delays accessing archived (AR) files from Mass
                Storage, due to tape drive upgrades. Please let the Helpdesk
                or Consult know if delays seem excessive.
  
  Sept 23 2003  The certificate for MSS has been renewed using NCSA's CA
                certificate. To continue using GSI authentication to MSS,
                please get a copy of NCSA's CA certificate
                (4a6cd8b1.0 and 4a6cd8b1.signing_policy) from
                ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/aces/ncsa-ca/certificates and place them
                in /etc/grid-security/certificates on your client machine.

%BHL%++ To perform a third-party transfer with five data connections:
   1. Run !UberFTP
   2. =open= the site you will use as the "remote" service.
   3. =lopen+ the site that you wish to use as the "local" service.
   4. =get= the file to transfer it from the "remote" service to the server you designated as a "local" service.
