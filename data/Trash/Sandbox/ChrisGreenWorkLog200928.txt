      <li>Cancel stalled TG jobs. Something is not right but no-one around right now to help. Neha back tomorrow. Try 10 jobs again when bluearc stabilizes.</li>

  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Question to Steve about OSG client config on gratia01.</li>
      <li>Improve configuration of OSG client / condor on gratia01. OSGMM is now controlled by Condor.</li>
      <li>Start trying to run jobs via TG gateway. Problems (apparently) due to WS config being hosed on all FNAL GKs.</li>
      <li>Work with Phil on intro to grid, globus-job-run and !CondorG.</li>
      <li>Compose and send out notes on TG meeting Monday.</li>
      <li>Respond to urgent request from Mats to suspend a user from the OSG VO due to multiple VO / certificate confusion.</li>
      <li>IM from Brian regarding D0 use of UNL and possible improvements -- their use of srmcp to pull a large amount of data onto each worker node is a major bottleneck, contributing to to up to 100% overhead (ie job takes twice as long as it would otherwise). Much better CPU use would result if they staged their files on the local SE and pulled from there. Discuss with Parag, get name (Adam Lyon) and pass on to Brian.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Investigate concern from Philippe that dCacheSimple() is not behaving properly. Problem is actually that replication from fermi-transfer to osg-transfer in bundles of 20 is not proceeding nearly fast enough -- queue size is not increasing on osg-transfer so fermi-transfer is not matching capacity. Increase bundle size to 200 and check to prevent queue growing too much on osg-transfer.</li>

      <li>Investigate disastrously slow transfer record processing rate on OSG collector reported by Brian. After investigation, turned out to be that the DB was swamped by stacked, stalled instances of the potted query, dCacheSimple. Apparently the nested query does not scale well to large summary tables.

      <li>Spend time investigating and diagnosing RSV-ITB error -- not enough memory allocated on VM. Investigate cause of knock-on problem caused on remote sites with large numbers of defunct processes. Something in the RSV system (or condor-cron) is dying before the probe is finished and its death certificate is collected. Discuss with Philippe and send email describing the problem to Arvind and ITB list. We should put some mitigation into the Gratia.py machinery but the zombie problem should still be solved upstream.</li>
      <li>Reply to request for status from Poonam on VDT / Gratia pyOpenSSL problem -- should be in 2.0.0p6.</li>
