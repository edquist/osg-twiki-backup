  <dt>2009/04/24</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Much discussion and trying things out with Preston on CAESAR: getting there but still a hiccough or two.</li>
      <li>Online Teragrid training.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2009/04/23</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Mail to Suzanne with G4 buzzwords (WLCG_WMS, DIANE, GANGA). Long discussion of OSG stack and common problems.</li>
      <li>Mail to Patricia and Alberto regarding availability during trip.</li>
      <li>Admit defeat to Alberto: suggest holding off until I get there. Suggested pulling in DIANE / GANGA experts.</li>
      <li>Receive TG training instructions and verify that videoconferencing software works.</li>
      <li>Request new DOE cert specifically for TG: heads-up to Tom B.</li>
      <li>Neha requesting full auth on TG and shortcut DN auth on NCSA.</li>
      <li>Reply with comments and edits on Suzanne's diagram.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2009/04/22</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>More discussions with Eileen, Gabriele, Debbie on CERN trip. Start paperwork. Fill in late justification.</li>
      <li>More troubleshooting attempts with Alberto, including 'phone calls and EVO. Nada. No useful signs of jobs on this end. No idea what the trouble is, but I would guess it has to do with their submission and workflow systems hiding otherwise perfectly obvious and easy-to-fix problems. Couple more suggestions.</li>
      <li>Reply from Neha with TG instructions. Add auth. tomorrow.</li>
      <li>Ask Dan for root on fnpc3x1 for diagnostics -- didn't help.</li>
      <li>Mail to John A. regarding trip.</li>
      <li>Long discussion with Suzanne Gysin on OSG structure and VO patterns.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2009/04/21</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Mail from Alberto: still a couple of hiccoughs and no returned output files for a test involving $OSG_WN_TMP. Ask for files to submit own jobs to ITB to trace problems. Probably just a script configuration issue. Trouble locating any information about the jobs, though. More email to Alberto. Hope to converge soon.</li>
      <li>More email with Ron C. on OSG VO security survey.</li>
      <li>Mail to Neha for OSG-Teragrid gateway permsissions.</li>
      <li>Chat to Gabriele on MPI and G4.</li>
      <li>Conversation with Debbie over logistics of a short-notice trip to CERN. Gabriele to discuss with Eileen / Ruth.</li>
      <li>Request to Daniel if anyone from FNAL CMS/G4 is heading out to CERN within the next month or so. Reply and email discussion. Bcc: email chain to Ruth and Gabriele.</li>
      <li>Ask Eileen about Argonne status.</li>
      <li>'Phone discussion with Abhishek re G4 progress.</li>
      <li>More email to Alberto. Maybe we'll have something to celebrate tomorrow. Maybe.</li>

      <li>Transfer probe reinstalled for CMS T1 storage. Check. Looks like we'll be double counting for 3/25 -> 4/1 due to the "interesting" way the upgrade was done: change partitions, install fresh billing DB and copy some entries to new billing DB from old. Something in the DB migration caused overlapping entries to not be considered duplicates.</li>
