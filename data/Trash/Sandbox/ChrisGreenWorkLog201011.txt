      <li>Much work to re-sync replication after failure on restart -- extra checks are necessary when temporary tables are in use to avoid shutting down the slave and losing the temporary table.</li>
      <li>Correspondence with Karthik on getting their patched probe to work. Check on backlog clearing.</li>
      <li>Change fBatchSize for gr12x3 to relieve query pressure on slave (FGCAB).</li>
