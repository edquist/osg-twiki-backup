  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>More work with Alain on lqcdg5. Problems with RSL, so deactivate. Also needed to download ant. Try again.</li>
      <li>Talk to Dan about Alexis' gridFTP problem -- looks like grid-mapfile use doesn't honor the RFC that mentions case should be irrelevant. Investigate further and report to vdt-support. Initial suggestions that problem is already fixed in 4.0.8.</li>
      <li>Bounce Iter meeting minutes to sharepoint. Discussion with Gabriele about missing Feb minutes. He will find and bounce to sharepoint.</li>
      <li>Get tgyro compiled on jacquard -- looks like FFTW has a circular dependency within its own libraries. Lovely. Submit test job.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>2009/06/11</dt>
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Get a successful globus build/run on gratia01: move to lqcdg5. Some basic guesses at architecture-specific tweaks to script and try it.</li>

      <li>'Phone conversation with Abhishek; remember promise to send email to Alberto with suggestions. Send email.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Request from Brian to change site translation for condor:cithep252.ultralight.org from CIT_CMS_T2B to CIT_CMS_T2</li>
      <li>Discussion with Brian about GPN-HUSKER. Change translation back to Nebrasks. Ask him to send email to gratia-operation about site name vs resource group.</li>
      <li>Answer question from Elizabeth regarding firewalls and Gratia. Answer it properly when I work out she's talking about a different Rob and therefore probes rather than a collector.</li>
      <li>Chat to Brian about MIT_CMS outage and how to avoid it next time. Looks like the main reason for data loss was that they didn't have PER_JOB_HISTORY_DIR set so they could only recover records for that part of the outage period for which the condor_history logs hadn't already rotated away.</li>
      <li>Fermigrid meeting.</li>

  </dd>

    <ul>
      <li>Request from Brian to remap SBGrid as sbgrid. Problem is that new FQANs default to SBGrid because that is the official VO name as reported by the proxy.</li>
      <li>Question from Brian regarding renaming sites. Mentioned that Nebraska could have a surfeit of processing power soon -- mentioned Geant4.</li>
      <li>Emails to Alexis with advice on tracing grid problems.</li>

      <li>Mail from Kyle regarding completion of addition of people to emailed reports in OIM.</li>
      <li>Reply to Steve's email about gratia09 reboot.</li>
      <li>IM from Elizabeth: Gratia tickets getting lost again. Investigate three most urgent:
      <ul><li>6885 (ATHENA): entered new site name and changed probe -> site translation</li>
          <li>6882 (Gridplexus): globus error 12 -- probably not reporting because no jobs are running.</li>
          <li>6880 (GPN-HUSKER): Translation changed but they haven't reported since 5/21.</li></ul></li>
      <li>Emails and ticket requesting addition to CD-Grid/GRATIA ticket group.</li>
