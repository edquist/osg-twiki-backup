---+ Installing the !NatSkin
I installed the [[http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/NatSkin][NatSkin]] on the [[https://cmssrv09.fnal.gov:8443/twiki/bin/view/Sandbox/WebPreferences][Fermilab test twiki]] in early 2007. I also installed in 2007 May on my own laptop in my development TWiki. 

Some lessons learned:
   * !NatSkin is easier to install with the latest version of TWiki, because it allows you to install plugins from the Configure menu. This is much easier than attempting to install the !NatSkin, which requires several dependency plugins, from the command line. This also means that the systems administrators could delegate the management of TWiki to others, keeping control of the server itself. This might be interesting to them, since they are overworked as it is.
   * Authenticating to the system is done through a different screen in the !NatSkin. Therefore, you must be sure to add %BR%<tt>   * Set HTTPSLOGON = on</tt> to the TWikiPreferences for this site. 
%WARNING% Trailing spaces will cause it to fail. Make sure that there are no trailing spaces after the =on=. 
   * The !NatSkin is considerably simpler to edit and change than the PatternSkin. PatternSkin has way too many styles in the stylesheet, making it almost impossible to figure out the nesting. I'm not sure why there are so many different nested classes in PatternSkin but it made me give up on trying to get the popout menus to work in the WebLeftBar.
   * !NatSkin has a nicer, easier to use WYSIWYG editor. More or less. I mean, nothing in TWiki is really ever going to be WYSIWYG, but this is pretty good. Better than what ships with Dakar+. 
   * WebLeftBar is wider and the typeface not set by points. I think that it takes your base font size from your browser, which increases the accessibility of our site.
   * NatSkin has been used at its developers' site (the [[http://nats-www.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/Main/WebHome][Natural Language Systems Division of the Dept. of Informatics at the University of Hamburg]]) since mid-2005. It seems robust enough compared to PatternSkin. There have been fewer issues reported on NatSkin but that may be because there are less users of NatSkin than PatternSkin. Still, I think that we can be confident that it is production-ready.
