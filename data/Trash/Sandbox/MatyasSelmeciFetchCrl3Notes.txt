---+ Sandbox.MatyasSelmeciFetchCrl3Notes (WIP)

---++ Package changes

Packages in our SVN that have =fetch-crl= as an explicit dependency:
   * =cms-rootd=
   * =dcache-gratia-probe=
   * =glite-ce-cream=
   * =osg-gridftp=
   * =osg-gridftp-hdfs=
   * =osg-gridftp-xrootd=
   * =osg-se-bestman=
   * =osg-se-bestman-xrootd=
   * =osg-se-hadoop= ( =-gridftp=, =-srm= )
   * =osg-wn-client=
   * =rsv-metrics= (?)
   * =voms-admin-server=

=rsv-metrics= says it requires =fetch-crl= but does not run it anywhere, so that dep can be removed.
Looks like it was for an old probe?

RPMs _outside_ of our SVN that have =fetch-crl= as an explicit dependency:
   * =nordugrid-arc-ca-utils= (epel) (we don't use it)

---++ Software changes

Stuff that can invoke or use (parts of) =fetch-crl= that should be changed to use =fetch-crl3= instead (if that exists):
   * =osg-configure= (=osg_configure.modules.utilities.fetch_crl()=)
   * =osg-test= (=test_06_fetch_crl.py=)
   * =osg-ca-manage= (checks if it's enabled and when it was last run)
   * =osg-ca-certs-status= (checks if it's installed and when it was last run)

---++ Docs changes
Twiki pages to update:
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallBestPractices
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallCertAuth
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallBestmanXrootdSE (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallGratiaService (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallGridFtpXrootd (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallGums
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallHadoopSE
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGBestmanSE (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGClient
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallRSV
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallVoms
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallWNClient
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallXrootd
   * [[Documentation.Release3.OSGServices]]
   * Documentation.Release3.OsgCaManage
   * Documentation.Release3.RsvPigeonTools (note: looks like it's only for osg 1.2 ?)
   * Documentation.Release3.SrmTester
   * Documentation.Release3.UnderstandingComputeElement (note: looks a lot like [[Documentation.Release3.OSGServices]], what's up with those two pages?)

Pages marked 'install transcript only' have transcripts ("screen dumps") of the output of a full installation procedure.
