      <li>Problem with CUNYGRID update to reconfigure Gratia probe. Site admin demanding and intolerant of reduced response due to holiday schedules. Ticket redirected to GOC for reassignment to someone who can help with failed OSG update. Also spoke to Suchandra on IM with heads-up.</li>
      <li>Examine collectors for catchup / other problems. OSG transfer still struggling. Discovered more failed clogger transfers on gr8x0. Transfer manually and send FYI to fermigrid-op. Enter incident at KC's request.</li>
      <li id="CD">Check into reporting of test transfers from LQCD SRM for Nirmal -- OK.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>More investigations into gr8x2 /tmp problems. Turns out to be not the collector, but the splunk script. If clogger is down then the history file stays in /tmp and must be uploaded manualy. Discussions on better ways to cope with the problem.</li>
      <li>Verify fix to CMS T1 SE upload.</li>
      <li>Continue to nursemaid replication recovery from gr5x0 to gr8x0. Replication needs to be caught up one entry at a time to avoid causing RMI communication between main collector service and servlets to time out and require service restart. Put in VDT ticket to see if there's a workaround.</li>

      <li>Investigate problem reported by Dan of /tmp filling up on gr8x0. Seems to be a couple of history files around the top of the hour, most hours under heavy load. Exact mechanism uncertain this time. Investigations ongoing.</li>
      <li id="CD">Email and discussions on mu2e and kca-proxy, documentation, etc, with Steve.</li>
      <li>Continue to monitor gr5x0 catch-up to gr8x0 -- tweak replication settings to try to speed things up. Restart after exceptions and stall. Monitor.</li>
      <li>Check housekeeping. gr8x2 has finished catch-up. Trigger one more time and FGCAB to reinstate backups. Monitor queue.</li>
      <li id="CD">Fix fg1x4 condor probe destination to avoid using LVS. Discussion on whether we need to send it to fermi-itb instead. Reconfigure for fermi-itb.</li>
      <li>More investigations on non-reporting of !IllinoisHEP-SE transfer -- discussions with Neha, examine logs, return email.</li>
      <li>Discover missing CMS T1 SE data from fermi-transfer. Put in ticket.</li>

      <li id="CD">Discussions, email and tutorial help for Rob K and Bob B of mu2e. Create "kca-proxy" script to safely update KCA-originated VOMS proxy without causing problems for running jobs.</li>
      <li id="CD">Check into Rick Coleman's tickets and discuss with Steve Timm / Rob K.</li>
      <li>Check into test optimization of fermi_osg and run test optimization of fermi_transfer. Discussions on optimization procedure with Dan.</li>
      <li>Investigation non-reporting of FNAL probes -- combination of stuck probes due to hard reboot of collector last week and misconfiguration following CE upgrades.</li>
      <li id="CD">Consolidate replication lines for gr5x0 and add one for badly-named probes fcdfIxJ.</li>
      <li>Discussions and investigations with Anthony T. into cmsosgce3 reporting problems. Fix and start backlog recovery.</li>
      <li>Investigate problem with weekly reports going to an ITB site. Get Scot K. to attach VDT-ITB to a resource group registered as ITB instead of OSG.</li>
      <li>Preliminary investigation on lack of reporting from !IllinoisHEP-SE. No smoking gun so far -- probe is handshaking but not sending transfer data. Reply asking for more diagnostics.</li>
