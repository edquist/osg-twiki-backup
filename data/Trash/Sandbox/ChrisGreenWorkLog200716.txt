Conversation with manasclerk at 7/10/2007 11:54:19 AM on chissgreen (aim)
(11:54:19 AM) Forrest Christian: in the source document, you have to name the sections:
(11:54:37 AM) Forrest Christian: %STARTSECTION{ "SomeName"}%
(11:54:38 AM) Forrest Christian: text
(11:54:42 AM) Chris Green: with standard # notation?
(11:54:47 AM) Chris Green: Ah, OK.
(11:54:54 AM) Forrest Christian: %ENDSECTION{ "SomeName" }%
(11:55:04 AM) Forrest Christian: then in the referencing doc,
(11:55:23 AM) Forrest Christian: %INCLUDE{ topic="MyTopic" section="SomeName" }%
(11:55:38 AM) Forrest Christian: Just be aware that it pulls in the heading levels as-is
(11:55:46 AM) Forrest Christian: i have a workaround but it's somewhat painful
(11:55:46 AM) Chris Green: Ah, I see; this is great.
(11:55:57 AM) Chris Green: Thank you.
(11:56:22 AM) Forrest Christian: check the docs (TWiki.VarINCLUDE) to make sure I have that closing section tag right
(11:56:28 AM) Forrest Christian: It might be STOPSECTION
(11:56:45 AM) Forrest Christian: it's whatever STARTINCLUDE's ending tag isn't
(11:58:07 AM) Chris Green: ENDSECTION
(11:58:11 AM) Forrest Christian: aha
(11:58:17 AM) Forrest Christian: well, there you have it
(11:58:43 AM) Chris Green: I could also use rev, and a regex, apparently.
(11:58:50 AM) Forrest Christian: oh yeah
(11:58:57 AM) Forrest Christian: i use regex all over for includes
(11:59:07 AM) Forrest Christian: but if you can use sections it makes your life MUCH easiery
