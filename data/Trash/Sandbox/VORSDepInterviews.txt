---++ Interview Questions 

   1 Do you use VORS programatically or for human readable information  gathering? (If programatically see question 2, if visually skip to  question 6)
   2 Where do you get you information? (tindex.cgi, ntindex.cgi,  OSG_map_info.txt, tindex3.cgi, other)
   3 These pages include several pieces of information, what do you  use? What do you not use?
   4 Is the CSV format provided good for you? What other format would  you suggest getting the information you us in?
   5 What other information would you be able to use if it were  provided? (Done with questions)
   6 What pieces of visual information do you use? Which do you not  use? (Map, VOs Supported Table, Detailed Resource Environment Info,  other)
   7 What other information would you like to see in a human readable  format that VORS does not provide you with?

---++ Summary of Answers by User

| Sebastian Goasguen | |
| 1 | I use the status map from my desktop machine (cilab.cs.clemson.edu) | 
| 2 | Uses map | 
| 3 | NA |
| 4 | NA |
| 5 | NA |
| 6 | I basically use the map.  I just need to click on a site and get basic information as well as the green/red status to verify everything is fine |
| 7 | 'MyOSG' seems pretty good |

| Malina Kirn | |
| 1 | Contacted and she has not been able to track down the system that accessed VORS.  (It had only 1 visit in all of March so it is likely an individual accessing the human interface.) |

| Ian Stokes-Reese | |
| 1 | Peter Doherty accessed VORS in March (which covers the 3 visits) but he now uses 'MyOSG' (and likes it).   Ian Stokes-Reese says they do not rely on VORS in any way and has no problem with its elimination |

| Steven Clark | |
| 1 | 41 uses in a month | 
| 2 | He uses one of the tindex urls (didn’t specify) | 
| 3 | Now we do our own test of all sites that support 'NanoHUB'.  Run scanning test (4-5 tests – is it there, can I connect, can I run simple job - hello world).  Put results on display & use results to direct jobs.   	Actually use site ID, name, url, pass/fail state.   Site ID is a directory for site results – Purdue uses same directory structure as VORS did.   Site ID is invariant, so Purdue uses that for downstream processing – unaffected by site name changes.   Simplest if ID was there and still the same one as VORS had.  |
| 4 | CSV works fine – simple scripts can parse it.   Would like a reader for xml file if xml is what is provided (the MyOSG xml file has a commented section that seams to specify the structure, but it  doesn’t look like it would be readable by a xml parser).   Would be best if you produced an identical CSV file, then only the url would have to be changed and tested once |
| 5 | Indication of processor availability or queue length would be great |
| 6 | Look at map to compare nanoHUB report to VORS map.   Also looks at details of status for a site (by clicking it in the table below the map).  Uses it to find the directories for data, etc., and what job manager is running (e.g. condor) |
| 7 | Steven has all the issues with 'MyOSG' Status map that were documented in issue 47 at http://code.google.com/p/osggoc/issues/list.   In addition, the drop down site list doesn’t correspond with the actual status page.  There are 2 Purdue sites in the dropdown (Purdue-CMS and Purdue-NWICG), yet the status list shows Purdue-RCAC, Purdue-CMS, & Purdue Steele.   The map only shows one ? for Purdue and it is called Purdue Caesar.   Steven believes that there should be 3 sites: Purdue-RCAC, Purdue-Caesar, and Purdue-Steele |
