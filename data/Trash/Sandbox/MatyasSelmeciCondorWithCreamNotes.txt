---+ Notes

---++ argus-parent

Needed to conditionalize the maven builddep. On el6, I use =maven=, on el5 I use =maven2=

---++ argus-pep-common

Still need our fixed maven-surefire-plugin files from the older version of this build.

---++ glite-ce-cream

*TODO* I don't like the way it starts tomcat on install. Fix that.

---++ emi-delegation-java

Needs =voms-api-java=. This is the same thing as =vomsjapi=.

=voms-api-java= was split out from voms after 2.0.6.


---++ glite-ce-cream-api-java

I was getting =java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/wsdl/WSDLException= in several places.
Turned out to be having classpath problems. I wrote a patch for the =build.xml= file.

Many errors caused by having outdated versions of =glite-ce-wsdl= and =glite-ce-common-java= so I versioned the dependencies in the spec file.

Right now I'm also having problems with "org.glite.ce.creamapi.ws.es.adl.Target_type0" possibly being outdated.
Target_type0 appears to be a product of the build so I'm not sure what's going on here.

Looks like it builds just fine if I have the EMI third-party repo enabled.
This repo contains a newer version of ant (1.7.1 vs 1.8.2) and axis2 (1.4.1 vs 1.6.1).
Looks like it's axis that's causing it.
We don't get axis from EPEL, we get it from jpackage.


---++ glite-wms-utils-classad

This failed on el6 because of autoconf/libtool differences.
EMI actually has a different SRPM for el6 so I'm taking both, using the spec file from one and using macros to pick which tarball to use.
This only works if =%rhel= is actually defined when rpmbuild is run, both to make the srpm, and to do the build.
osg-build does it right for scratch builds and our buildsys-macros are correct too.

---++ glite-wms-utils-exception

See glite-wms-utils-classad above.
