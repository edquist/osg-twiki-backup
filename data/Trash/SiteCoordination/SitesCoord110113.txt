---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/

---++ Planning Hands-On session at OSG All Hands meeting
The proposal for this year OSG all hands meeting is to have a hands-on session similar to a install fest or an organized troubleshooting session:
   * there will be no presentations during the session
   * some tutorials and pointers to instructions will be made available to attendees in advance
   * attendees will go through tutorials or installations during the session or in advance
   * attendees can use the session to receive support while installing OSG software or geting familiar with it (if they are new to OSG), they can follow one of the tutorials, or troubleshoot or optimize their OSG resources.
   * topics will range from installation of resources (like GUMS, CE, SEs, or clients) to network troubleshooting and optimization
   * a pool of experts (you) will be available for one-on-one or group support
   * some questions/answers will be collected in advance to provide some structure, some will be asked during the session
   * participation in person is encouraged but remote participation (via phone or adobe connect) is possible for both experts and attendees.

Experts agreed to review an update the tutorials they prepared for the Site Administrators meeting in August:
   * OSG client - Marco
   * Networking - Jason
   * SE (Bestman-hadoop from Michael) - Tanya
   * GUMS - Steve
   * CE - Suchandra (added after)

We'll meet back in about 2 weeks. Marco will send a doodle poll about the exact time/day.

Marco will be tomorrow at the workshop coordination meeting and present the session proposal:
   * firm the time and place (room with telephone and projector, extra  computer for Adobe Connect)
   * check if the format is OK
   * will experts have to pay the registration for the extra half day?
   * will attendees have to pay the registration for the extra half day?
   * Wednesday evening session during the poster reception
   * Other focused panels? Experts are OK but not enthusiasts. Should be coordinated with other session chairs to avoid duplication and overlaps
