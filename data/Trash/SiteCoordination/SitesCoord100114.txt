---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/

---++ OSG Tier 3 documentation (Marco Mambelli) 
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/tier3-doc.pdf][tier3-doc.pdf]]: tier3-doc.pdf
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Tier3/WebHome
   * Comments:
      * Current documentation is not the quintessential Tier 3: rather more complex than a minimal Tier 3, several components not needed for a Tier 3, Nothing that is not already documented in other OSG documents (e.g. Condor is complex and not necessary, same for xrootd). It is not generic and there may be simpler installation. (Alan)
      * Should make clear at the onset the limited context. A more generic effort should start with a survey of the existing user base and requirements: have questions (what is your environment? do you have a cluster? ...) and provide more examples (simple CE+SE, only a campus grid, ...). Tier 3 are one of the greatest potential but OSG is perceived as difficult and this document is still complex.
      * There should be better support for asking certificates and renewing them. It is overlooked and is a recurring problem specially with new sysadmin. (Steve)
    * ?
   * Marco will send out a poll (to people potentially interested in Tier 3) to find out:
      * what range of hw or options are there?
      * which local resources?

---++ How OSG can better support sites, specially Tier 3s:
   * GOC is available 24/7 via phone and Internet to submit tickets
   * OSG Campfire is available every Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, 11am to 2:30pm (and frequently also outside this schedule)

   * Site Coordination meetings
   *  Tutorials
   *  Topics for the All Hands meeting (Mar 8-11, FNAL) 

---++ OSG 1.2.5 deployment status (and OSG 1.2.6 plans)                                                           
   * OSG 1.2.6 should be available next week (Suchandra)
