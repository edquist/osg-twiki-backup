---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.

---++ Next Site Administrators workshop
The next site administrators workshop will be this coming Summer, probably in the first two weeks of August.
As usual it will be a great occasion to learn more about OSG and to interact with OSG experts.
This year it will include also user-oriented sessions or forums, covering topics like: job submission, Glidein WMS VO frontend installation and management, Campus Factory installation and management.
We are in the planning hase.

Please write to osg-sites or to marco@hep.uchicago.edu if you are:
   * interested in hosting the event at your institution
   * would like to propose discussion topics
   * would like to partecipate as speaker or to suggest someone that we should invite

---++ OSG deployment status 
Current production release is 1.2.19, ext release is currently in VTB testing, soon ITB.

---++ New sites (specially Tier3)
