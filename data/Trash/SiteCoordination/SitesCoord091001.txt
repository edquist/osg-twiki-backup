---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 2:15 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link: http://osg.acrobat.com/osgsc091001/
      * Then you may check your audio setting
         * Allow flash to use microphone/speaker
         * Test audio  (Meeting>Manage My Settings>Audio Setup Wizard...)
      * To speak you'll have to press the "Talk" button or the lock next to it
      * If you are not a speaker you may use "Raise Hand" in the "My Status" bar in the "Attendee List" pod

---++ RSV Control
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/RsvControl
   * rsv-control and brief introduction to RSV
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/rsvcontrol091001.pptx][rsvcontrol091001.pptx]]: rsvcontrol091001.pptx
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/rsvcontrol091001.pdf][rsvcontrol091001.pdf]]: rsvcontrol091001.pdf

---++ Deployment status
Last production version is 1.2.3. Updates are under testing but not expected soon.

---++ New sites

---++ Security
   * Security discussion will be on the regular agenda of this meeting
   * Mine reminded site administrators to update the kernel of their machines, specially headnodes that are accessible from the outside network. Update of internal workernodes is not as urgent but should still happen.
Sysadmins had been notified using the security contacts in OIM.
This upgrade is more important than other security updates circulating on RHN both because of the problem (escalate to root) and the expected likelihood of the attack.
