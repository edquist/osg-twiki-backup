---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link: http://osg.acrobat.com/osgsc091119/
      * Then you may check your audio setting
         * Allow flash to use microphone/speaker
         * Test audio  (Meeting>Manage My Settings>Audio Setup Wizard...)
      * To speak you'll have to press the "Talk" button or the lock next to it
      * If you are not a speaker you may use "Raise Hand" in the "My Status" bar in the "Attendee List" pod

---++ Deployment status
---+++ OSG 1.2.4 released
OSG 1.2.4 has been released
<!--   * Release notes: -->
   * Update: Trash.ReleaseDocumentationOSG124UpdateInstructions
   * Known issues: Trash.ReleaseDocumentationKnownIssues

---+++ Tier 3 configurations
In order to help the Tier 3 documentation effort ( Trash/Tier3.WebHome )
it is useful to know which configurations will be in use across Tier3s, e.g. will there be the need to install a CE on the same host of a SE?
This may become a worry because CE has already a GridFTP server that may interfere with the one of the SE (specially is special file systems like Xrootd or Hadoop are used).

Rob  reported that in CMS there are small  T3s that have CE and SE on the same host, but they all have Bestman SRM gateway on top of the regular file system, so the same GridFTP as the CE can be used.

Marco will investigate urther for next week with the site administrators of these T3s.
