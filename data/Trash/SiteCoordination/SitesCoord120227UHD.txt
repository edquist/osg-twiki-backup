---+ OSG / University of Houston Downtown meeting - Feb 27, 2012 

---++ Coordinates
Direct call Hong to Marco
"Lin, Hong" <linh@uhd.edu> - 281 360 8073

---++ Minutes
Brought Hong up to speed with latest OSG release (RPM based, new small sites page).

UHD has a cluster with Rocks.
A student installed a batch system but they are not using it (ssh directly to the resources).

They are interested in installing a OSG site (CE, WNs) and show up in MyOSG.
They would like to contribute their resource to OSG and show up in OIM and monitoring.

They may be able to find a student able to take care of the installation but Hong is concerned with the load for the student.

Hong's preference would be if some other OSG institution can find a student to take care of the installation and setup. They would give him/her access to UDH resources as needed to install OSG.

Marco said that this is not the way it works normally and would be difficult to find a student in some other institution. He and OSG will remain available to provide support once a UDH person is found.
