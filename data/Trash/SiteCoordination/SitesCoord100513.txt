---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link in the introduction above.

---++ Special topic: Job Workflows in OSG (Marco, Jose, Parag)
Jobs are submitted to OSG sites in a variety of ways. Here we'll give an overview, focusing specially on:
   * implications for Sites accepting jobs
   * requirements for VO/users submitting jobs
Topics will be:
   * Introduction to workflows in OSG (see Documentation.JobSubmissionComparison) (Marco)
   * Panda (Jose)    
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/Panda_Sites_Meeting.pdf][Panda_Sites_Meeting.pdf]] ([[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/~caballer/panda/Panda_Sites_Meeting.pdf][alt download]])
   * Glidein WMS (Parag)
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/OSGSiteCoordinationMeeting-13May2010-glideinWMS.pdf][OSGSiteCoordinationMeeting-13May2010-glideinWMS.pdf]]
   * For more information about the OSG !MatchMaker: http://osgmm.sourceforge.net/

---++ Proposal to install locally Gratia collectors (Keith Chadwick)
   * A local Gratia collector could be useful for large sites. Keith and Steve Timm, for Gratia operations, are coordinating/promoting the installation of Gratia collectors locally where appropriate. 
   * Several sites (specially larger ones) expressed interest. Fermigrid and Nebraska have already a local Gratia collector.
   * A local Gratia collector:
      * would allow query of the local records (faster than relying on the central collector)
      * could upload more efficiently local records to the central collector (by grouping them together)
      * would still make your records available to the central collector (no change in your OSG accounting)

Here an email from Keith Chadwick:<pre>FermiGrid (Steve Timm, Dan Yocum and I) have been asked by Ruth Pordes to
help/promote larger OSG sites installing site specific gratia collectors.

Ruth Pordes has provided an initial target list of sites:

        BNL             John Hover
        Purdue          Preston Smith, Fengping Hu
        OU              Horst Severini, Karthik Arunachalam
        UCSD            Terrence Martin
        Vanderbilt      Sebastien Goasguen
        Florida         Paul Avery
        Buffalo         Steve Gallo
        Wisconsin       Dan Bradley
        Nebraska        Brian Bockelman

This list is also available on the OSG Accounting twiki, look for
"Gratia Collector Deployments":

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome#Gratia_Collector_Deployments

We have a set of hardware recommendations for local Gratia collectors
(the precise hardware recommendation depends on the site of the site).

http://cd-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=3598

There is the "gratia-collectors@opensciencegrid.org" distribution list,
for further assistance/questions.  To reduce SPAM, this is a closed list
with open subscription (you must join the list to be able to post to it).

-Keith.
</pre>

*IMPORTANT NOTE* After the meeting it has been clarified that some information currently collected in the central Gratia repository (like individual file transfer records) will be dropped from the central catalog and some sites may find the information useful. One more reason to deploy a local Gratia repository.

---++ Security report/announcements
   * the security team is preparing and testing the migration to the new format of the CA distribution, compatible with the new naming convention used by SSL. It will be available sometime during the summer and will be a non disruptive upgrade (the regular certificate upgrade will provide the new distribution).
   * check the blog: http://osgsec.blogspot.com/

---++ OSG deployment status 
   * current production version is 1.2.9

---++ New sites (specially Tier3)
