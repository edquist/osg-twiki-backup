---++ General requirements
All attendees should have laptops (wireless Internet access will be available).
They should also have a valid grid certificates for the OSG and have it loaded into their Web browsers. Information about certificates and how to obtain them is available [[Documentation.GetAccessToGrid][HERE]].
Install-fest attendees should have the necessary server/s and possibly have already server/service certificates.
Specific session requirements will be listed in the session descriptions below.

---++ Program discussion/description

---+++ OSG 1.2 (Marco Mambelli)
Open Science Grid overview for experienced users (what is new in OSG 1.2/VDT 2) and introduction for newcomers (short with pointers for further information): architecture, documentation walkthrough, Installfest introduction.
Lightning overviews (about the parallel sessions).

Presenters:
   * OSG 1.2: Alain Roy
   * Session overviews: session chairs (or designated speakers)

---+++ GUMS and Computing Element installation - !InstallFest 1 (Steve Timm, Suchandra Thapa)
*GUMS installation: Standalone and in an High Availability setting. (Steve Timm)*
The first part of the GUMS installation will show how to install a single GUMS
server using the normal OSG Release Documentation.  We will also cover simple administration
tasks of GUMS such as adding a new group.  We will then show how to replicate
the high-availability GUMS setup at Fermilab.  Draft tutorial information is at 
[[http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dgf684mf_2fb5kmnd4&hl=en][Google Docs]] but some of it still needs
to be updated for GUMS 1.3.x.

*CE Installation* walk through, then one on one tutoring/problem solving.

*Requirements*
Attendees should have the necessary server/s and possibly have already server/service certificates.
GUMS and CE installation will require one server each (it can be the same if you are just testing) with a platform [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]] and you will need admin (root) privileges.
The installation of High availability GUMS server will require a machine to host two VMWare virtual machines.
If any, the cluster (queue manager, worker nodes) behind your CE must be up, running and connected to the internet.
You can write to ... if you have specific questions about your configuration and requirements.
If you are updating an existing installation, a backup of the existing installation is recommended.

---+++ Security best practices (Doug Olson)
Security best practices.
Unix security best practices, OSG processes and expectations
   * Policies
   * Expectations & Assumptions
   * Useful Tools & Practices
   * Examples

---+++ Network performance and troubleshooting (Rich Carlson)
Hands-on troubleshooting using the client tools - In this session attendees would have to use the clients included in VDT or boot their laptop using the Knoppix ISO.  This would give them access to the client tools.  Rich would run a server on his laptop and can create network faults that the attendees would find.  

If time allows some tips on configuring the !perfSONAR server will be provided.

*Requirements.*
This session will require a network switch in the meeting room with access to the Internet for NTP & DHCP.
Attendees will need a laptop with OSG-Client installed. If this is not possible (e.g. Windows machines) they could boot the laptop using the Knoppix live CD provided including the client tools.

---+++ Tier 3 focus (Dan Fraser)
OSG for Tier 3 and smaller centers. This will be discussed in small informal sessions not in a separate session.

---+++ Storage Element - !InstallFest 2 (Alex Sim, Iwona Sakrejda)
Installation walk through, then one on one tutoring/problem solving. SRM (what is, different options in VDT dCache and various !BeStMans), Support for different FS in !BeStMan(xrootd, Hadoop, NFS or other POSIX like)    

*Requirements*
Attendees should have the necessary server/s and possibly have already server/service certificates.
Servers must be a platform [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]] and you will need admin (root) privileges.
All installations are possible on a single server, anyway multiple servers are recommended for bigger and more performant installations, e.g. for use in production. Some recommended deployments:
   * dCache:
   * BeStMan-Xrootd:
   * BeStMan gateway:
You can write to ... if you have specific questions about your configuration and requirements.
If you are updating an existing installation, a backup of the existing installation is recommended.

---+++ Virtual Machines (Alex Younts)
   * Hands-on session demonstrating the use of a Nimbus Cloud and deploying OSG services in a Cloud
   * Discussion about spinning up user software inside cloud images and the security implications of cloud computing

*Requirements*
Participants should have a grid certificate and contact ayounts@purdue.edu in advance so there are enough resources available during the session.

---+++ Monitoring (Rob Quick)
   * Hands-on session explaining how administrators can use [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu][MyOSG]] to their advantage to monitor status, debug, look for accounting data, etc. 
   * Information on ensuring clean topology information in OIM -- lot of other services depend on OIM data, and can produce misleading results if OIM has bad data
   * How to convert existing scripts into an RSV probe; how to plug it into an existing RSV setup?
   * How to upload RSV results from a site level RSV client to a Nagios server.
   * Other possible topics ... 


---+++ Other interesting topics
Possible tracks (faculty to be recruited).
   * OSG Packaging discussion: platforms to be supported. Paman vs Native packaging systems (RPM, YUM, Debian, ...)
   * Other Storage track - dCache, xrootd (hadoop - possibly)
   * Supporting VOs and end-users
   * Performance - site assessment, improving reliability; troubleshooting & logging
   * LHC Tier 3 issues
