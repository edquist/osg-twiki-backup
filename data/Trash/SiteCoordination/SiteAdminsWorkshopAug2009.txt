---++ Background
The next OSG site administrator's workshop will be held at the OSG Grid Operations Center in Indianapolis, August 6, 7 2009.  The focus will be the upgrading of OSG CE's and SE's with the OSG 1.2 production release.   The focus is on *practical*, hands-on issues relating to OSG site administration.

---++ Organization

*August 6*
   * Morning plenary - lightning overviews
   * Afternoon - parallel technical tracks
   * OSG 1.2: OSG for newcomers (introduction) and for experienced (new in 1.2), documentation walkthrough, Installfest introduction                                                                                                                                                   
   * Best practices preview: Best practices for Maintaining a site and Security best practices                                                                                                                                                
   * Other Short session previews: Storage, VM, Network (perfsonar testing), Monitoring (centrally and at the Site)                                                                                                                                        

*August 7*
   * First hour talks that could be of interest also to site admin involved in installfest (or count on the fact that they could have an installation in progress while attend other sessions and convene for troubleshooting/help):
      *  I:  Security
      * II: HA
      * III:Storage
   * Track I: InstallFest
      * CE in the morning: walk through, then one on one tutoring/problem solving
      * SE and VOMS in the afternoon: walk through, then one on one tutoring/problem solving                                                                                                                                                
   * Track IIa: Storage: SRM (what is, different options in VDT dCache and various !BeStMans), Support for different FS in !BeStMan(xrootd, Hadoop, NFS or other POSIX like)                                                                                                     
   * Track IIb: Virtual Machines: Supporting VM in a cluster,  user sw as VM (Cern VM, ...), OSG services as VM (SE, VOMS?), Interacting with Clouds                                                                                                                                                 
   * Track IIIa: monitoring/performance: Network monitoring (installing and using Perfsonar), Nagios and RSV, Accounting (Gratia)
