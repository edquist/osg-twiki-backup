---++ Background
The next OSG site administrator's workshop will be held at the OSG Grid Operations Center in Indianapolis, August 6, 7 2009.  The focus will be the upgrading of OSG CE's and SE's with the OSG 1.2 production release.   The focus is on *practical*, hands-on issues relating to OSG site administration.
