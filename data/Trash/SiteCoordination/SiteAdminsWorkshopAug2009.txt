   * Specific session requirements will be listed in the session descriptions below.

---++ Program discussion

The content and the requirements for the sessions have been moved to an included document (see below) that is included also in the public page of the workshop: ReleaseDocumentation.SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug09.


Use the following sections for internal notes (for presenter/faculties, ...)

---+++ OSG 1.2 (Marco Mambelli)
Presenters:
   * OSG 1.2: Alain Roy
   * Session overviews: session chairs (or designated speakers)

---+++ GUMS and Computing Element installation - !InstallFest 1 (Steve Timm, Suchandra Thapa)
   * Simple GUMS install, Steve Timm, 1 Hr.  Includes why you should install GUMS, major steps in installing GUMS, and some work with
the GUMS admin GUI.  For first session need one linux machine, ~10GB disk, 2GB RAM.  Plus a http cert.
   * Simple CE install, Suchandra Thapa, 1 Hr.
   * Coffee Break
   * Overview of High Availability GUMS install, Steve Timm, 1 Hr.  For this session need six real or virtual machines, ip's for all, http certs for a service ip.

    Significant time will be available during both sessions to do work on installs and each presenter will be available to answer questions
    while the other is presenting.  Time may be reallocated due to need or to audience demand.  Goal is that any admin should be able to
