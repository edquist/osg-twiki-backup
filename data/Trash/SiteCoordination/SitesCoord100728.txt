Workshop resources:
   * organization page: SiteAdminsWorkshopAug2010
   * tutorial page: ReleaseDocumentation.SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug10
   * Indico (agenda, registration): http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3429

Remind people to register by 8/2

By the end of the week faculty of hands-on sessions should provide in the tutorial page a section with a brief description and a list of requirements if the [[ReleaseDocumentation.SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug10#General_Requirements][general requirements]] are not sufficient: ReleaseDocumentation.SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug10

The tutorial page provides examples and directions for the workshop material, specially for the hands-on sessions.
Hands-on sessions will be documented using the OSG twiki.
Faculty can write one or more documents as needed and link them to their section on the tutorial page.
Some sessions have a link to previous documents. Faculty can use them as starting point or write a brand new document.

By the next meeting 8/4:
   * Faculty of hands-on sessions should provide a complete version of the hands-on documentation so that it can be reviewed.  It does not have to be the final version but has to allow a testing of the tutorial.
   * Faculty with a talk are encouraged to provide a first version of the slides to receive some feedback

Session chairs should follow up with presenters in their session to make sure that all the contributions are covered.
   * Tanya will give the introductory talk to the storage session
   * Brian/Derek's talk about Xrootd in WAN has been added to the agenda
   * Rob Snihur will contact site administrators for the talks about small and big Tier 3. Kevin may give the talk about big Tier 3.
