---++ Notes

Gabriele and Marco introduced OSG following the presentation.

NDSU has a strong group working on material sciences. There is no known connection between local scientists and existing OSG VOs. They may consider starting a new VO.

NDSU resources use CentOS. They are in the process of completing the assembly and networking of the cluster. Marco suggested to allow outbound connectivity from all the nodes: even if it is not strictly required by OSG many VO cannot run without it.
They may be ready to consider the OSG software by the end of July.

The OSG documentation is in the TWiki:

Check also the [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG_Intro_extended.pdf][presentation]] (getting started page)

It may be overwhelming to find your way at the beginning, so we suggest to contact someone in OSG when you are ready:
   * we can setup a follow-up phone meeting
   * send an email to Marco or to osg-sites@opensciencegrid.org
   * connect to the OSG Campfire Web chat: https://integrationcloud.campfirenow.com/6e62e
