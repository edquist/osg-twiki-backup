The focus will be on the migration to RPM packages.

---++ Organization

List of tutorials for workshop attendees from last year ReleaseDocumentation.SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug10
New page coming soon.

Each hands-on session should have:
   * a section in that document specifying a brief introduction, the requirements (if there are extra requirements after the generic workshop requirements at the end of that page and repeated [[#General_requirements][below]]), a link to the hands-on tutorial page, optionally some reference page or other related documents.
   * a hands-on tutorial page. ReleaseDocumentation.HandsOn provides stylistic guidelines for the tutorial page. ReleaseDocumentation.TemplateHandsOn is a template and ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationHandsOn is an example.
