Dear  Marco,                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                        
I am a new faculty member at Oregon State University in the School of Civil and Construction Engineering. I have        
just moved up from UC San Diego where I recently completed my Ph.D.                                                     
                                                                                                                        
I have been working with Gabriele Garzoglio and Marko Slyz since April/May of last year as a user of Open Science       
Grid.  Gabriele identified that Oregon State University had not yet joined OSG, and I am now motivating the IT          
managers of the HPC cluster of the College of Engineering here at OSU to do so. Based on their receptivity I hope to    
gather more research centers here at OSU.                                                                               
                                                                                                                        
Gabriele mentioned that you (or Dan, also cced) could point me to the documentation I currently looking for in order    
to setup a compelling case for having OSU join OSG:                                                                     
                                                                                                                        
(i) procedure/steps that need to be taken by us in order to join,                                                       
(ii) advantages/disadvantages (if any) of OSU joining Open Science Grid -  Gabriele already gave me some great          
pointers                                                                                                                
(iii) a list/guide of what we will need to install on our side,                                                         
(iv) possibility and availability of support from your side in the setup stage.                                         
                                                                                                                        
Thank you very much for your time and looking forward to hearing from you.                                              
                                                                                                                        
Best regards,

Subject: RE: Contacts to inquire about OpenGrid

Hi Marco and Gabriele,

Please let this serve to make the bridge between OSG and OSU and to move towards having OSU be part of the OSG
consortium.

For the OSU people, let me introduce Marco Mambelli and Gariele. Marco is one of two people at OSG responsible for
production and site / campus activities. Marco provides some support in the form of consultation / QA sessions with
site administrators. Gabriele Garzoglio has let the OSG user efforts and has been my main contact at OSG for almost
a year now.

For the OSG people, I would like to tell you that we met yesterday here at OSU, and we is:
- Todd Shechter (Director of CoE IT and EECS network administrator),
- Mike Sander (the administrator of our local cluster),
- Paul Montagne (IT manager of the School of Civil Engineering and the School of Chemical Engineering),
- and, I.

We went over some of the information (see slides attached) that I gathered from Marco and Gabriele, and we have
identified two main interests that we would like to discuss and explore with OSG:

(1) possibility of connecting a HPC cluster (or part of it) to OSG
(2) looking at the intra-campus deployment of condor with OSG's orientation


I am more than glad to lead this effort, although I realize that direct communication between the people involved in
the IT and Cluster management is the best way to move forward. Anyway, if there is anything I can help with please
let me know.

Dear Paul and Mike,
attached is the presentation with some added pages about OSG documentation to get you started and to show resources available for support (Some pointers to OSG technical documentation).

From our discussion seems that the initial resource that you'll test with OSG is a great match for our current model and available software: a cluster with RHEL5 nodes, 2 NICs each (site + private), SGE job manager and a shared file system..
OSG is not supporting currently RHEL6 that you have on the other cluster but we are already working on it and univa should be not too different form SGE so future expansion on the other cluster will be possible.

It was great talking with you and hope to hear soon from you via email or on Campfire.
Best,
Marco
