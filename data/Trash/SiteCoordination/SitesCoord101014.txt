---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link in the introduction above.

---++ Special topic: The OSG experience of South American sites  
Presentation by Harold Enrique Castro Barrera (Universidad de los Andes): Grid Colombia
   * Slides are in AC and attached:  [[%ATTACHURL%/Grid_Colombia_OSG_Oct_2010.pptx][Grid_Colombia_OSG_Oct_2010.pptx]]
   * The presentation is available in the AC and Flash recordings (see above)
   * Summary: Grid Colombia currently counts 15 (soon 17) sites using the RENATA infrastructure (4 are "real" clusters). The OSG approach (with instructions to first build a cluster and connect it on the Grid) suited its requirement better than a top down site installation. 80 people attended the OSG workshops in Bogota' and Bucaramanga. Local training grew the pool of experts. Currently there are more than 100 site admins knowledgeable about the OSG Stack, cluster building (with Condor as local scheduler), installing and configuring CE and SE. A local CA is close to be approved.


---++ Security report/announcements
   * check the blog: http://osgsec.blogspot.com/
   * The CILogon pilot project (Doug Olson)
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CiLogonPilot2010
   * Information is on the Twiki page above and the linked pages. The presentation is available in the AC and Flash recordings (see above)
   * Summary: The CILogon project facilitates secure access to CyberInfrastructure (CI). Jim Basney is one of the project leaders. It will provide short lived certificates to users identified in different manners (login, campus credentials, ...) by the involved parties (Universities, inCommon). Short lived certificates for the same user would have always the same DN allowing the inclusion in VOs (VOMS registration). The CAs for this project are not in IGTF so are not installed by default. More precise instructions will be provided on how to add this CAs using =vdt-ca-manage=. 

---++ OSG deployment status 
The current production version is OSG 1.2.14.
The next patch release 1.2.15 is expected in a couple of weeks.

---++ New sites (specially Tier3)
