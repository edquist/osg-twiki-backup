---++ Special Topic: New releases in OSG Release 3 
since last Tuesday have been released as part of the OSG 3.0.5 also CE and SE components, so now the OSG production release available as RPM includes:
   * VOMS 
   * wn-client
   * osg-client
   * glexec
   * CE 
   * SE, Xrootd/Hadoop and Bestman2

New RPM Releases are in standard FHS paths.
To update you'll have to source the old setup files and turn off the Pacman installation.
Install as instructed Release3.
For the CE/SE you can take the config.ini and with few changes you should be able to have that configuration.

The wn has to be installed on all nodes. Anyway since we are using EPEL and std library we are not duplicating libraries and the package is much smaller.

Packages have been tested also interoperating with release 1.2 (client to CE and vice-versa).

Scalability of Globus 5 included in OSG Release 3 is comparable or better than GRAM2 included in OSG 1.2.

There will be a discussion about the proposal to provide a mirror of EPEL (or at least the OSG dependencies) with limited controlled updates. John Hoover started the proposal in an email because BNL prefers not to depend form EPEL. Alain will answer probably extending the discussion to a larger circle.

Xin: BNL plans to update one gatekeeper in a couple of weeks

Horst: no updates planned at the moment, may update one of the CE on OSCER in a couple of months.

---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link in the introduction above.


---++ SecurityTeam report/announcements
   * check the blog: http://osgsec.blogspot.com/

Xin suggested to report to the security team that updates of the CA package should be preceded by a warning message sent to the administrators to avoid RSV warnings like with the recent 1.25. A heads-up message would be sufficient.


---++ OSG deployment status 
Current production release is 1.2.25, future Pacman release will be only security updates
Some software is available already as RPM, Release3:
- VOMS

---++ New sites (specially Tier3)

---++ This will be the last regular monthly Site Coordination meeting until further notice.
