---+++ Background
The next OSG all hands meeting will be held in Indianapolis, March 11 to 14. On Thursday 2/14 morning there will be tutorials.
There will be two parallel tracks.
The focus is on *practical*, hands-on issues relating to OSG users.
   * Meeting homepage in OSG Indico system is [[https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=5610][here]]
   * Timetable [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=5610][agenda]]


Here is a tentative agenda:
   * Track one:
      * OSG security for users, transition to the commercial CA
      * Certificates for GA/RA
      * TBD
   * Track two:
      * Bosco
      * OASIS
      * Skeleton_key 

Each hands-on session should have:
   * a section in that document specifying a brief introduction, the requirements (if there are extra requirements after the generic workshop requirements at the end of that page and repeated [[#General_requirements][below]]), a link to the hands-on tutorial page, optionally some reference page or other related documents.
   * a hands-on tutorial page. Trash.ReleaseDocumentationHandsOn provides stylistic guidelines for the tutorial page. Trash.ReleaseDocumentationTemplateHandsOn is a template and Trash.ReleaseDocumentationClientInstallationHandsOn is an example.

---+ General Requirements
These apply to the attendees of both tracks.
Attendees are expected to have a laptop for use SSH and to connect to their resources.
Attendees of track one should already have a valid grid certificate; it is not mandatory for track two. 
<!--Attendees should install an OSG 1.2 Grid client ([[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationClientInstallationHandsOn][OSG client installation]]), specially if they plan to attend the Network session or to test grid resources.-->
Information about certificates is available [[Documentation.GetAccessToGrid][here]].  Attendees will work with their own servers or VMs which should have pre-installed certificates as specified below in the requirements for the different sessions. 
Hosts for Pacman installations should be one of the platforms [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]]. Hosts for RPM installations should be RHEL 5 based systems (Centos 5 and SL5 are OK). 
Attendees of the "Site administrators" tracks will need admin (root) privileges for most of the sessions.
