<pre>
Hi Jeff and Brian,
feel free to contact me for any question about the installation of the OSG software.

Here is a page with support resources:
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/HelpProcedure

or contact me directly.

Best regards,
Marco Mambelli
</pre>

Marko offered support for job submission.

Plan:
   1. Jeff and Brian will get personal and host/service   certificates from DOEgrids. Some more-complete   instructions are appended below.
   2. UMD-IGS can help identify a scientist who has a   suitable application that they'd like to run on   OSG. OSG User Support can then work on a   proof-of-principle project with that user.
   3. UMD-IGS and OSG User Support can work together to nstall the grid software needed to add UMD-IGS   to OSG.

 For now we plan to schedule future meetings on an as-needed basis.
