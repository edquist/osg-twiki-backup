We'll give an in-depth introduction to the OSG Compute Element, and how it fits into your site. We'll also talk about some of the options for Storage Elements. One the second day, we'll have a hands-on session where we will guide you through installing a CE. Currently, this session is a full-day, but we hope that people complete it in the morning and go to the _Advanced Topics_ session instead. (But we're happy to extend the session if people need more help!)
   * References: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome][General OSG Documentation]]; *OSG 1.0 Release Documentation*: ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome 
   * Pre-workshop preparations: For the hands on session, you'll need a few things:
      * A computer on which to install your CE. It needs to have a public interface, so you can log on remotely and access it, and so it can accept jobs from OSG users.
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][Host and HTTP Certificates]] Getting them can be a pain. If you need help, we'll help out at the meeting, but if you get them in advance, life will be simpler.
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGet][A Personal Certificate]] Some comments as Host and HTTP certificates
      * If you want to attach your CE to a batch system (most people do) please have it pre-installed and ready. However, this is not a pre-requisite: we can have a functional (if limited-value) CE without a batch system.

---+++ OSG Security
   * Leads: Mine Altunay 
   * Topics: Securing your environment: best practices, tools, checklists, expectations, state of the art security stuff (for site administrators)
