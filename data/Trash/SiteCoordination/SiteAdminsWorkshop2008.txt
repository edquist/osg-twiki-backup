---++ Technical sessions
 Preparations: tutorial-like and other technical materials to be prepared in advance by session leaders. Site admins should prepare resources in advance including host certificates, etc (see below for specific pre-workshop preparations). Individual sessions will be led by experts from OSG and other projects.


---+++ Network performance monitoring and tuning
   * Lead: Rich Carlson 
   * Topics: 
      * Introduction to perfSONAR monitoring framework 
      * Introduction to end-user diagnostic tools 
      * Hands-on troubleshooting tasks using the tools to solve real problems 
   * Goals: 
      * Attendees will learn how to quickly respond to a user complaint about poor network performance. They will learn how to determine if the problem is caused by the network infrastructure, the host configuration, or the application behavior. Attendees will also learn how to quickly retrieve network performance data from remote locations, and how to find test points along the end-to-end path. 
   * References: 
   * Pre-workshop preparations: 
      * Attendees should bring an Intel based laptop to the workshop. A bootable CD with all the tools will be provided, this bootable disk will NOT touch the local HD or damage the laptop in any way.

We'll give an in-depth introduction to the OSG Compute Element, and how it fits into your site. We'll also talk about some of the options for Storage Elements. One the second day, we'll have a hands-on session where we will guide you through installing a CE. Currently, this session is a full-day, but we hope that people complete it in the morning and go to the _Advanced Topics_ session instead. (But we're happy to extend the session if people need more help!)
   * References: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome][OSG Installation Documentation][
   * Pre-workshop preparations: For the hands on session, you'll need a few things:
      * A computer on which to install your CE. It needs to have a public interface, so you can log on remotely and access it, and so it can accept jobs from OSG users.
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][Host and HTTP Certificates]] Getting them can be a pain. If you need help, we'll help out at the meeting, but if you get them in advance, life will be simpler.
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGet][A Personal Certificate]] Some comments as Host and HTTP certificates
      * If you want to attach your CE to a batch system (most people do) please have it pre-installed and ready. However, this is not a pre-requisite: we can have a functional (if limited-value) CE without a batch system.

---+++ OSG Security
