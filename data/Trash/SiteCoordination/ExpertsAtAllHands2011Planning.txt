Description of the session, see: ExpertsAtAllHands2011

Marco will present the session at the VO forum (phone meeting) and ask to Marcia for suggestions to reach out to the users community.
Gabriele will be at the meeting as well. 
Update: we'll have few lines advertising the session in the OSG news

Marco will confirm the attendance of some xrootd expert like Andy or Wey. Marco will firm with Alain the names of the VDT expert/s.

The list of experts is in ExpertsAtAllHands2011. Please correct it if there are mistakes or omissions.

Here is a to-do list for all the experts that will be at the session (in person or remotely):
   * register if they did not 
      * in the registration form indicate that you'll attend the "talk with the experts" session on Thursday
      * no need to pay for Thursday (unless you attend other events that day)
   * correct their registration if needed by sending an email to ahm2011@sbgrid.org (no later than next week):
      * let organizers know that you'll attend the Thursday session
      * ask for a reimbursement if you paid for Thursday
   * review ExpertsAtAllHands2011
   * in their section 
      * provide a description of their activity and/or main areas of expertise, of the kind of questions that they will answer
      * provide references to documents important for their area 
      * review the tutorials from pervious editions (you know who you are)
      * provide background material for attendees interested in preparing for the session (hands-on tutorials, documents with recommandations, suggested readings)
      * feel free to point to documents in the OSG documentation; if there are none, is appreciated if you contribute some

The next meeting is in about 2 weeks and by then the material and ExpertsAtAllHands2011 should be almost ready for the session attendees.

If you have any question do not esitate to contact Marco.


---++ Logistic
As far as logistic: I asked for a room with tables where people could work on laptops, possibly where
people working on the same problem could interact or experts could join to the table.
Table layout is not very important, anyway no amphitheater or theater style (row of chairs with no
table) room.
A room with internet access and power (for the laptops).
One projector+screen, possibly a speakerphone and a computer that could be dedicated to project a
presentation and/or run adobe connect (flash application). A second projector and a camera showing the
room to the remote attendees would be an added bonus.

A description of the session and the planning discussion with the experts is in January site
