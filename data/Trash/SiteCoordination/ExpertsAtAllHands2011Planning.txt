---+!! <nop>Talk with the Experts at OSGAH - Planning page
%TOC%

---++ Logistic
As far as logistic: I'd prefer a room with tables where people could work on laptops, possibly where
people working on the same problem could interact or experts could join to the table.
Table layout is not very important, anyway no amphitheater or theater style (row of chairs with no
table) room.
A room with internet access and power (for the laptops).
One projector+screen, possibly a speakerphone and a computer that could be dedicated to project a
presentation and/or run adobe connect (flash application). A second projector and a camera showing the
room to the remote attendees would be an added bonus.

A description of the session and the planning discussion with the experts is in January site
coordination meeting:
