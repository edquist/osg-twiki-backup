---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.

---++ Special topic: SVOPME policy work presentation - Nanbor Wang, !TechX
SVOPME is a tool for !VOs and sites that makes it easy to handle complex internal organizational structures and their privilege mappings at sites. The tool was developed in collaboration with !TechX as part of an SBIR. 
Today's presentation is targeted for VO and resource administrators with details about existing deployments.
