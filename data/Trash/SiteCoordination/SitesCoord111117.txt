---++ Special Topic: OSG Release 3 (Suchandra Thapa)
General availability
   * VOMS 
Components in limited availability:
   * wn-client
   * osg-client
   * glexec
Future plans for limited availability releases:
   * CE beginning of December
   * SE beginning of December, Xrootd/Hadoop and Bestman2

New RPM Releases are in standard FHS paths.
To update you'll have to source the old setup files and turn off the Pacman installation.
Install as instructed Release3.
For the CE/SE you can take the config.ini and with few changes you should be able to have that configuration.

The wn has to be installed on all nodes. Anyway since we are using EPEL and std library we are not duplicating libraries and the package is much smaller.
 
---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
