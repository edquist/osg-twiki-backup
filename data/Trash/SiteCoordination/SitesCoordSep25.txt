---++ VORS in the future (Rob Q)

With the success of RSV in ATLAS and CMS, we are starting to move toward making RSV a required part of OSG reporting. This also means the eventual demise of VORS, so as a first step, I would like to ask the VOs and Sites how they use VORS, which feature are absolutely necessary to keep, which feature are unused, what additional functionality they would like to see. - Rob Q.
