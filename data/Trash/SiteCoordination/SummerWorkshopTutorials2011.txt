---++ Introduction

This is a repository of information for the OSG Summer workshop and the CMS Tier 3 workshop, both held at the Texas Tech University (Lubbock, TX), August 9-11, 20101.   
   * Meeting homepage in OSG Indico system is [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=4531][here]],  [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=4531][agenda]].
   * Planning and organization: SiteCoordination.SummerWorkshop2011
   * Suggest format for hands-on guides [[HandsOn][here]], for example: ClientInstallationHandsOn.

---++ General Requirements
These apply to both the OSG site administrators and the CMS Tier 3 workshops.

Attendees should already have a valid grid certificate. Attendees should install an OSG 1.2 Grid client ([[ClientInstallationHandsOn][OSG client installation]]), specially if they plan to attend the Network session or to test grid resources. Information about certificates is available [[Documentation.GetAccessToGrid][here]].  Attendees will work with their own servers which should have pre-installed certificates. GUMS and CE installations will require one server each (it can be the same if you are just testing) with a platform [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported by VDT]].  You will need admin (root) privileges.  

---++ OSG and Tier 3s (Marco Mambelli)
This session presents an overview of OSG 1.2, VDT 2.0 and introduces some OSG concepts and the Tier 3 idea to newcomers.  This will be followed by a presentation of key security concepts.

Attendees will receive a brief description of the hands-on sessions.

---++ OSG Security ()
Give an introduction about certificates, CA, CRLs, trusted relationships on OSG.

Instruct on security best practices for site administrators and users.

---++ Network performance and troubleshooting (Jason Zurawski) - LAST YEAR
*Description:* Hands-on workshop will introduce the participants to network performance tools, and suggest strategies to locate and quickly resolve problems.  Emphasis will be placed on the use of diagnostic tools available in VDT including [[http://www.internet2.edu/performance/owamp/][OWAMP]], [[http://www.internet2.edu/performance/bwctl/][BWCTL]] and [[http://www.internet2.edu/performance/ndt/][NDT]] as well as introducing the concept of regular monitoring through the use of the [[http://psps.perfsonar.net][perfSONAR-PS]] framework.  

*Requirements:* Workshop exercises will be performed on a specially designed testbed accessed from the participants laptop.  Participants will need to have a laptop with a web browser and a terminal capable of connecting to remote resources via SSH.  Plugins for Flash and Java for the web browser will be required to view some of the web content.  

*Hands-on Section*
   * NetworkPerformanceTroubleshootingHandsOn

*Agenda:* 2h total

---++ KVM hands-on (Steven Timm, Suchandra Thapa)


---++ Storage Element Introduction (Douglas Strain)
*Description*:  This talk will introduce the concept of a storage element and illustrate several examples and their usage, include Bestman Gateway with Hadoop/Xrootd, Bestman Fullmode, and dCache.  This will not be a hands-on talk.

*Requirements*: none.

---++ Storage Element Installation: !BeStMan2 and Hadoop (Jeff Dost)
*Hands-on guides:*  HadoopInstallationHandsOn  Participants are encouraged to be familiar with Hadoop and the installation process from the official OSG Hadoop twiki page: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/Hadoop

*Requirements* The participants will need to have a minimum of two servers, but preferably three or four, and root access on all servers.  All servers should have a single public IP address.  All servers must have the fuse kernel module and fuse userspace packages installed.  All servers must have Sun Java 1.6 installed.  A working gums service is required for user mappings; grid-mapfile mappings are not currently supported. One server will run the Hadoop !DataNode, one will run the Hadoop Namenode, one will run the Hadoop Secondary Namenode, and one will run the Bestman and Gridftp processes.  The BestMan+GridFTP server must have a valid host or service certificate installed in /etc/grid-security/{hostcert.pem,hostkey.pem} (for gridftp) and /etc/grid-security/http/{httpcert.pem,httpkey.pem} (for BestMan).

---++ Xrootd and Distributed Xrootd

---++ Job submission overview (Marco Mambelli)

---++ Installing a Glidein WMS VO frontend (Derek Weitzel)

---++ Installing a Campus Factory (Derek Weitzel)

---++ OSG client installation and basic use (Marco Mambelli)

---++ Tuning for HTPC submission, GPU, ... and using a single submit host (Marco Mambelli)


---++ Rocks hands-on

---++ Puppets hands-on (Suchandra Thapa)

---++ Moving away from Pacman to RPMs (Alain Roy)

You might have heard that OSG is moving away from the Pacman-based version of the VDT and is working on a version of the VDT based entirely on RPMs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (and variants). Alain will give you the scoop--what are the goals, what's the timeline, and what can you try out now? Alain hopes that you can give constructive criticism to make sure that are moving in the right direction and making the right technical decisions. Please come and give feedback!

Some background reading:

   * [[/SoftwareTeam/CommunityPackagingProposal][Community Packaging Proposal]]--the overview of our appraoch
   * [[/SoftwareTeam/NPTransition][Transition Plan]]
   * [[/SoftwareTeam/RPMDevelopmentGuide][RPM Development Guide]]--details of our technical approach for the curious.

---++ Fault tolerant installations and virtualization (Steven Timm)

---++ OSG installation tuning (CE/GUMS, ...)

---++ OIM and MyOSG (Scott Teige)
*Description:* In this tutorial you will learn how to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMRegistrationInstructions][register]] a person, a resource, a site, etc. in the OSG Information Management (OIM) system. There will also be a short demonstration of some the the most popular features of [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/about][MyOSG]], the "one stop shopping" site for the OSG. Nearly the entire content of this tutorial is given in this [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMStandardOperatingProcedures][overview]].

*Requirements:* You should have a valid grid certificate installed in your browser.

---++ Data movement with Globus Online (Douglas Strain)
*Description*: In this tutorial, you will register with Globus Online, set up your credentials, and go through an example data movement using the Globus Online transfer service.

*Requirements:*  You will need a machine with ssh, and access to 2 gridFTP servers.  You will need a valid grid certificate.  (Optional) You may need access to a myproxy server.  Also, it would help to speed the tutorial if you create an account on Globus Online before the tutorial.
