---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 2:15 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link: http://osg.acrobat.com/osgsc091001/
      * Then you may check your audio setting
         * Allow flash to use microphone/speaker
         * Test audio  (Meeting>Manage My Settings>Audio Setup Wizard...)
      * To speak you'll have to press the "Talk" button or the lock next to it
      * If you are not a speaker you may use "Raise Hand" in the "My Status" bar in the "Attendee List" pod

---++ Security 
Concerning the warning about DOE CA. The warning should not have been critical, anyway, because of it, the certificates issued between 10/12 and 10/19 may not be accepted. If you experience difficulties with certificates issued between 10/12 and 10/19, then request a new certificate.

---++ Deployment status
Michael installed 2 new sites and likes the new possibility to easily install 2 CE with the same batch queue using almost the same config.ini
