---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/

---++ CRL update problems and possible solutions (Igor Sfiligoi)
   * http://osgsec.blogspot.com/2010/02/crl-update-problems.html
   * Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/osg_crls.pdf][osg_crls.pdf]]: osg_crls.pdf
   * Igor: OSG is evaluating if there is the need to provide a solution for the failing downloads of the CRL. Problem and a possible solution are outlined in the presentation.
      * the solution would require effort: development and operation at GOC
      * OSG will provide it only if there is a strong need
   * Keith: FNAL is feeling the problem and is working on an in-house solution
   * Other site administrators are disturbed by the emails but do not pay much attention to it
   * Doug: the error is the certificate expiration. If the download fails but the CRL is still valid this should be flagged differently from a CRL expiration (different email or possibility of no email)
   * Marco: we may ask to the wrong crowd. The users failing to authenticate are the ones noticing the problem. Then several production sites use few Proxyes to run all the jobs (DOEGrid certs) so are not visibly affected by the expiration of other CRLs
   * Not enough site administrators to estimate the relevance of the problem
   * Action items:
      * Igor will provide a revised presentation adding more details on the solution (fallback mechanism) and some examples of tricky errors due to CRL expiration
      * Marco will take care to schedule a short presentation/discussion/vote in a joint session at the OSG All hands meeting next week

---++ Other Security report/announcements
