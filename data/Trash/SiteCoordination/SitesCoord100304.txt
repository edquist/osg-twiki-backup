---++Meeting format
   * Once a month, on the second Thursdays, 11am
   * Available on Adobe Connect
   * In depth topic
   * Deployment status and new sites
   * Security report 


---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/

---++ CRL update problems and possible solutions (Igor Sfiligoi)
   * http://osgsec.blogspot.com/2010/02/crl-update-problems.html
   * Presentation: [[%ATTACHURL%/osg_crls.pdf][osg_crls.pdf]]: osg_crls.pdf
   * Igor: OSG is evaluating if there is the need to provide a solution for the failing downloads of the CRL. Problem and a possible solution are outlined in the presentation.
      * the solution would require effort: development and operation at GOC
      * OSG will provide it only if there is a strong need
   * Keith: FNAL is feeling the problem and is working on an in-house solution
   * Other site administrators are disturbed by the emails but do not pay much attention to it
   * Doug: the error is the certificate expiration. If the download fails but the CRL is still valid this should be flagged differently from a CRL expiration (different email or possibility of no email)
   * Marco: we may ask to the wrong crowd. The users failing to authenticate are the ones noticing the problem. Then several production sites use few Proxyes to run all the jobs (DOEGrid certs) so are not visibly affected by the expiration of other CRLs
   * Not enough site administrators to estimate the relevance of the problem
   * Action items:
      * Igor will provide a revised presentation adding more details on the solution (fallback mechanism) and some examples of tricky errors due to CRL expiration
      * Marco will take care to schedule a short presentation/discussion/vote in a joint session at the OSG All hands meeting next week

---++ Other Security report/announcements
   * check the blog: http://osgsec.blogspot.com/

---++ Final planning for the joint Tier 3 session 
The Tier 3 joint session at the OSG All Hands meeting is short. Planning and respect for the tight agenda will be important.
Current Agenda:
   * 15:30		ATLAS Tier 3 Organization and Plans (10')	Rik Yoshida (ANL)
   * 15:40		CMS Tier 3 Organization and Plans (10')	Rob Snihur
   * 15:50		Open Discussion (10')	Compare and Contrast Efforts
   * 16:00		ATLAS use of Virtualization for Tier 3's (10')	
   * 16:10		Open Discussion (10')	
   * 16:20		CMS use of Hadoop (10')	Brian Bockelman (University of Nebraska)
   * 16:30		OSG On-going Support Plans for Tier 3's (20')	Dan Fraser (ANL)
   * 16:50		Final Discussion (10')

Proposal for different topics are welcome but please email them to Rob Snihur or Marco

---++ OSG 1.2.6 deployment status 

---++ New sites (specially Tier3)

---++ Follow-up - CRL update survey results
A survey has been conducted to asses if OSG should modify the procedure used to update the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) of the Certification Authorities (CAs) (problem presented above). 

Below are the results.

If you saw the presentation at the OSG All Hands meeting ot the problem is clear to you, then you can go to the questions. 
If you missed the presentation few slides and a summary about the issue are linked:
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/SiteCoordination/SitesCoord100304/osg_crls.pdf
http://osgsec.blogspot.com/2010/02/crl-update-problems.html 

In short:
X509 security requires users to have an updated CRL published by the CA. Each OSG site downloads a CRL from each of the CAs. This download sometime fails causing error messages. If the CRL at the site is expired some users may be unable to authenticate causing errors sometime difficult to troubleshoot; if the CRL is still valid, the next attempt will update its content.
OSG could provide a central copy of the CRLs: OSG sites would download all CRLs from OSG and go to the CA only if that download fails. This could alleviate some of the problems but would require software development and operation effort. So OSG would like to asses the need for it.

---+++ Survey results
As visible in the [[%ATTACHURL%/crl_survey-SurveySummary_03222010.pdf][survey summary]] most site recognize the problem and are in favor of a centralized solution. Anyway the problem is minor, mostly perceived as an annoyance. 
Some interesting suggestion came form the answer to the open questions.

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/crl_survey-q4a.rtf][Q4 replies]]

---+++ From the OSG Security team
Here a message from the OSG Security Team:
<pre>Dear site admins.

The results from the survey about the CRL updates problem are in.
And the majority of you seem to think the problem is only mildly annoying.

So it is definitely a low priority action item and we will not be making any changes in the short term.

However, the majority of you did seem to like the idea of centralizing the CRL distribution,
so we are still planning to get to that solution in the long term.

Thanks for the feedback,
  Igor Sfiligoi
  for the OSG Security Team
