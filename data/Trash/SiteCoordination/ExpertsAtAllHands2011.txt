---+!! <nop>Talk with the Experts session at the OSG all hands workshop
%TOC%

---++ Description
The "talk with the experts session" on Thursday morning
is an open, loosely structured interactive session where OSG experts are available to guide and support
users (scientists and system administrators).
Pointers and reference material and tutorials are available on  ExpertsAtAllHands2011 (this page).
Attendees preferably should check the provided material and submit questions in advance via email to marco@hep.uchicago.edu.
The goal of the session is to help with any question OSG users or site administrators can have about OSG and related topics. 
Below is a list of experts with their main expertise areas. Attendees can address a specific expert if they prefer or simply submit the question to the session. 
Pre-submitted questions will be sorted and answered in "dedicated moments" during the morning.
During the morning attendees will mostly work on their own tasks (one of the proposed tutorial or some
installation or improvement).
Experts will provide one-on-one and group support in the room and to remote attendees. Solutions to
problems of general interest will be broadcast to all interested attendees.

Topics include planning, installation, configuration, optimization and
troubleshooting of OSG resources (CE, SEs, GUMS, ...) and of Condor, xrootd
network optimization and troubleshooting, security, job submission and
data movement in OSG (use of the tools in OSG client, glidein-WMS),
help with software available via VDT, support resources available to OSG
users and site administrators.

Some interesting reading:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationGuide][Here]] are the instructions to install OSG client tools
   * The [[Trash/Tier3.WebHome][Tier 3 Web]] provides instructions focusing on small sites: from the design to the deployment on OSG 

---+++ Alain Roy
Alain is the OSG software coordinator and leads the team that is responsible for the VDT. He'll answer any questions he can, including, but not limited to, questions about baking bread.

---+++ Igor Sfiligoi
Igor has long time experience with glidein systems, going back to [[http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/publications/cdf7630_glidecnaf.pdf][2005]]. He is currently leading the operations of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/GlideInWMSServiceLevelAgreement][OSG glidein factory @UCSD]], helps running the CMS user analysis glidein pool, and is part of the [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/][glideinWMS]] development team. He will be happy to take any glidein, or more generally [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] question you want to throw at him (satisfactory answers not guaranteed, though).

Igor is also a member of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityTeamMembers][OSG operational security team]]. While you will rarely see him directly talking to the sites about security issues, he still has a good range of the security knowledge due to his work in the background. Feel free to ask him about security architecture and practices (but don't complain (too much) if you don't like the answer).

Finally, Igor is leading the [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/OSGScal][OSG Scalability, Reliability and Usability area]], where he enjoys pushing various software components to their limits, as well as playing with new software. He is also supposed to look over documentation and complain when some pages are hard to understand. If you have complaints about any piece of the OSG software architecture, he is the guy to bug (please provide paper and pencil, though).

---+++ Doug Strain
Doug works in OSG storage.  He will be answering questions about OSG storage.  He can help out with the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationHadoopInstallationHandsOn][Hadoop Hands On]] tutorial or answer other questions.

He is the developer of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/viewauth/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationRSVPigeonTools][Pigeon Tools]] package and can answer questions about that or about RSV monitoring in general.

Doug also is a developer in the [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/][glideinWMS]] and can answer questions about glide-ins if Igor gets busy.

---+++ Suchandra Thapa
Suchandra coordinates the Trash/Trash/Integration Test-Bed in OSG, a group that tests all the OSG software in a Grid environment before releasing for production. He will answers to questions about OSG compute elements and configuration of components of the OSG software.

---+++ Steve Timm 
Steve is an expert system administrator at Fermilab. He is involved both in the ITB testing and in running production.  If you have questions about
designing, building, operating, or maintaining big compute elements he can help.  He can also help with questions of installing and maintaining GUMS and VOMS.  He can also answer generic questions about making services redundant and/or highly available.   His group operates the production Gratia servers and can answer some questions about deploying gratia collectors and probes.

Steve has done the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGUMSHandsOn][GUMS Hands On Tutorial]] for the past few years, if you are going to have any questions on GUMS please read this tutorial first and try to get as far through it as you can.

---+++ Jim Weichel
Jim has been working with OSG for 2.5 years on various projects such as: assessing the Value of OSG, analyzing the staffing levels needed for Operations, and initiating a study and project to improve OSG documentation.  The result of that study, including proposals for improvement, was documented in [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=861][Documentation Alignment Initiative]].  He did a triage/analysis of all the official documentation in the OSG TWiki and conducted followup workshops of OSG experts to validate the plan and implement the improvement project that is currently underway.  Jim will answer to questions related to OSG documentation and collect suggestion about its usability and completeness.  For an overview of the OSG Documentation Process see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/DocHowTo][Documentation.DocHowTo]].

---+++ Jason Zurawski
Jason is a Network Engineer and Research Liaison with Internet2 focusing on network performance monitoring and troubleshooting in support of scientific activities.  An inherent part of international scientific collaboration is use of the network to move large datasets and interact using tools such as audio and video.  This constant use of the network places extreme pressure on operational staff to ensure that network performance is meeting the expectations of users.  Typical tools, including those found in the OSG software stack, rely on the TCP protocol to move data, end to end, both reliably and quickly.  Faults in the underlying infrastructure, mostly caused by packet loss and delay in or between domains, can severely effect the performance at the application layer.  Debugging these problems in a multi-domain environment can be a nightmare for even the most capable system administrator.  

The [[http://psps.perfsonar.net][perfSONAR]] framework is a network monitoring infrastructure that consists of a collection of diagnostic and regular monitoring tools to measure key metrics of the network.  An emphasis is placed on discovering and sharing the resources in peer domains - thus enabling "self service" when examining problems reported by end users.  Performance indicators such as available network bandwidth, network latency, packet delay variation (e.g. Jitter) and loss and re-ordering characteristics are all important when determining the performance of a network, and ensuring that end to end paths are clean.  The tools of the perfSONAR framework aim to expose these metrics and offer further insight into the murky process of cross-domain debugging.  

The following materials are available for use, and are based on the successful [[http://www.internet2.edu/workshops/npw/][Internet2 Network Performance Workshop]], a 2 day event where users learn the root causes of performance problems, learn to effectively use the tools in a structured manner, and debug a network that contains many of the common problems.  A variation of this material was also presented in August 2010 at the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/NetworkPerformanceTroubleshootingHandsOn][OSG Site Administrators Workshop, held in Nashville TN at Vanderbilt University]].
