---+!! <nop>Talk with the Experts session at the OSG all hands workshop
%TOC%

---++ Description
The "talk with the experts session" on Thursday morning
is an open, loosely structured interactive session where OSG experts are available to guide and support
users (scientists and system administrators).
Pointers and reference material and tutorials will be provided in advance.
Attendees preferably should go through it and submit questions in advance.
The goal of the session is to help with any question OSG users or site administrators can have about OSG and related topics. 
Below is a list of experts with their main expertise areas. Attendees can address a specific expert if they prefer or simply submit the question to the session. 
Pre-submitted questions will be sorted and answered in "dedicated moments" during the morning.
During the morning attendees will mostly work on their own tasks (one of the proposed tutorial or some
installation or improvement).
Experts will provide one-on-one and group support in the room and to remote attendees. Solutions to
problems of general interest will be broadcast to all interested attendees.

Topics include planning, installation, configuration, optimization and
troubleshooting of OSG resources (CE, SEs, GUMS, ...) and of Condor, xrootd
network optimization and troubleshooting, security, job submission and
data movement in OSG (use of the tools in OSG client, glidein-WMS),
help with software available via VDT, support resources available to OSG
users and site administrators.
