---+!! <nop>Talk with the Experts session at the OSG all hands workshop
%TOC%

---++ Description
The "talk with the experts session" on Thursday morning
is an open, loosely structured interactive session where OSG experts are available to guide and support
users (scientists and system administrators).
Pointers and reference material and tutorials will be provided in advance.
Attendees preferably should go through it and submit questions in advance.
The goal of the session is to help with any question OSG users or site administrators can have about OSG and related topics. 
Below is a list of experts with their main expertise areas. Attendees can address a specific expert if they prefer or simply submit the question to the session. 
Pre-submitted questions will be sorted and answered in "dedicated moments" during the morning.
During the morning attendees will mostly work on their own tasks (one of the proposed tutorial or some
installation or improvement).
Experts will provide one-on-one and group support in the room and to remote attendees. Solutions to
problems of general interest will be broadcast to all interested attendees.

Topics include planning, installation, configuration, optimization and
troubleshooting of OSG resources (CE, SEs, GUMS, ...) and of Condor, xrootd
network optimization and troubleshooting, security, job submission and
data movement in OSG (use of the tools in OSG client, glidein-WMS),
help with software available via VDT, support resources available to OSG
users and site administrators.

with the press and promoting your research.

---+++  Gabriele Garzoglio 
Gabriele works in OSG user support. He will answer questions along the lines of 
of methods for users needing to run large numbers of jobs or needing to access a large amount of data,
how to bootstrap new communities in the use of OSG and how to improve current suboptimal practices for existing VOs

---+++ Andrew Hanushevsky
Andy is a xrootd developer and will help with all that is xrootd (tuning, installation, roadmap, ...) 

---+++ Scot Kronenfeld
Scot is a member of the VDT team and will be at the session to help people with the VDT, CE installations, and RSV monitoring.

---+++ Alain Roy
Alain is the OSG software coordinator and leads the team that is responsible for the VDT. He'll answer any questions he can, including, but not limited to, questions about baking bread.

---+++  Tanya Levshina 
Tanya is the coordinator of OSG storage for VDT. The Storage group is responsible for the support of various storage related software that include !BeStMan, !dCache, hdfs, xrootd as well as gratia and rsv storage and transfer probes . She can try to answer questions related to  installation and configuration of the SEs but doesn't mind answering questions about Russian poetry as well. 

If you want to understand more about OSG SE or try to install it check out the following documents:

%INCLUDE{"Storage/WebHome" section="StorageTutorials"}%
---+++  Marco Mambelli 
Marco is responsible for OSG site coordination and support. He is also active in the OSG Tier 3 initiative, aimed at providing solutions targeting smaller sites, and has been involved in the testing of OSG client tools. You can ask questions on different support and collaboration resources available for site administrators, or on how to contribute resources to OSG, or on how to start planning for a new resource. 

Some interesting reading:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.ClientInstallationGuide][Here]] are the instructions to install OSG client tools
   * The [[Tier3.WebHome][Tier 3 Web]] provides instructions focusing on small sites: from the design to the deployment on OSG 

---+++ Igor Sfiligoi
Igor has long time experience with glidein systems, going back to [[http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/publications/cdf7630_glidecnaf.pdf][2005]]. He is currently leading the operations of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/GlideInWMSServiceLevelAgreement][OSG glidein factory @UCSD]], helps running the CMS user analysis glidein pool, and is part of the [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/][glideinWMS]] development team. He will be happy to take any glidein, or more generally [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] question you want to throw at him (satisfactory answers not guaranteed, though).

Igor is also a member of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityTeamMembers][OSG operational security team]]. While you will rarely see him directly talking to the sites about security issues, he still has a good range of the security knowledge due to his work in the background. Feel free to ask him about security architecture and practices (but don't complain (too much) if you don't like the answer).

Finally, Igor is leading the [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/UCSDTier2/OSGScal][OSG Scalability, Reliability and Usability area]], where he enjoys pushing various software components to their limits, as well as playing with new software. He is also supposed to look over documentation and complain when some pages are hard to understand. If you have complaints about any piece of the OSG software architecture, he is the guy to bug (please provide paper and pencil, though).

---+++ Doug Strain

Doug works in OSG storage.  He will be answering questions about OSG storage.  He can help out with the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HadoopInstallationHandsOn][Hadoop Hands On]] tutorial or answer other questions.  He can answer questions about Lustre, BeStMan, the SRM protocol, and other storage technologies.

He is the developer of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/viewauth/ReleaseDocumentation/RSVPigeonTools][Pigeon Tools]] package and can answer questions about that or about RSV monitoring in general.

Doug also is a developer in the [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/WMS/glideinWMS/][glideinWMS]] and can answer questions about glide-ins if Igor gets busy.

---+++ Suchandra Thapa
Suchandra coordinates the Integration Test-Bed in OSG, a group that tests all the OSG software in a Grid environment before releasing for production. He will answers to questions about OSG compute elements and configuration of components of the OSG software.

---+++ Steve Timm 
Steve is an expert system administrator at Fermilab. He is involved both in the ITB testing and in running production.  If you have questions about
designing, building, operating, or maintaining big compute elements he can help.  He can also help with questions of installing and maintaining GUMS and VOMS.  He can also answer generic questions about making services redundant and/or highly available.   His group operates the production Gratia servers and can answer some questions about deploying gratia collectors and probes.

---+++ Jason Zurawski
Jason is a network expert, member of Internet2.

---+++ Other VDT team members
