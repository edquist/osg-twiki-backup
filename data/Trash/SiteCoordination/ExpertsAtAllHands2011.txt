---+!! <nop>Talk with the Experts session at the OSG all hands workshop
%TOC%

---++ Planning
The "talk with the experts session" on Thursday morning
is an open, loosely structured interactive session where OSG experts are available to guide and support
users (scientists and system administrators).
Pointers and reference material and tutorials will be provided in advance.
Attendees should go through it and submit questions in advance.
Pre-submitted questions will be sorted and answered in "dedicated moments" during the morning.
During the morning attendees will mostly work on their own tasks (one of the proposed tutorial or some
installation or improvement).
Experts will provide one-on-one and group support in the room and to remote attendees. Solutions to
problems of general interest will be broadcast to all interested attendees.

Topics include planning, installation, configuration, optimization and
troubleshooting of OSG resources (CE, SEs, GUMS, ...) and of Condor,
network optimization and troubleshooting, security, job submission and
data movement in OSG (use of the tools in OSG client, glidein-WMS),
help with software available via VDT, support resources available to OSG
users and site administrators.
