---++ Globus infrastructure performance/improvements (Charles)

---+++ Pre-WS GRAM performance
   * *Follow up:* 
      * A proposal to improve the performance and robustness of GT2 GRAM via a configuration change to use the WS-GRAM SEG (scheduler event generator). 
      * http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/execution/prewsgram/admin-index.html#s-gram-admin-seg 
      * Protect gk from rogue users that don't have grid monitor enabled. Based on events rather than constant polling. 
      * Issue: no condor logfile rotation. 
      * Interaction with gridmonitor not known. 
      * Not well tested - will test on ITB w/ a user submitting workflow w/o condor-g. 
   * Will work with Suchandra and Ben Clifford to try out on UC ITB. Will use Swift - high volume non-condorg submitter. 

---+++ WS GRAM delegation error
   * *Follow-up*: 
      * Globus fix but no reported tests - *there's a patch, but its not been tested*. 
      * http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=6271 
   * Will show up in the next VDT release. 

---+++ Globus 17 & 43 errors (Steve)
   * *Follow-up:* 
      * Large number of Globus errors 17 & 43: Errors being investigated as a Globus-Condor issue: *update* - there were a couple of fixes in the condor gahp server - Steve Timm is testing a version from Condor. 
      * No time to test. There is a patch, will test before next meeting. 
   * From Steve: new gahp server available from Jamie. Running for a couple of weeks. Will come with a pre-release of Condor-G (possible will be available in Condor 7.0.6). Effects all scheduler sites. 
   * Alan Sill reporting Globus 17 probs, has LSF job manager.

---++ OSG 1.0 bugs (Jeff)
   * *Follow-up:* 
      * Configure-osg doesn't pick up VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo names correctly (footprints 5572 & 5573) 
         * Suchandra has sent a new package which should fix these bugs; - sent to Steve, but not yet tested. 
      * Configure-osg error at STAR-WSU (footprings 5419) *fixed? no longer in footprints*
         * Suchandra has sent a fix for these. 
      * Once these are tested he'll release it to Rob Q for the OSG. 
   * Brian reported vo-map.txt file if empty, configure-osg causes problems w/ GIP - needs a warning.
   * Bestman - SBGrid site problems.  Unique problems, not yet bug reports.  Fermilab client needs an additional flag.
   * RSV on a non-standard port - not handled well. Requires Suchandra and Arvind's coordination.

---++ AOB
   * Feature request from Alan: keeps certs from worker node client installation. Would be nice to specify on installation the certificates directory.  configure-osg.py assumes they're in the CE location.
   * Meet again in two weeks.
