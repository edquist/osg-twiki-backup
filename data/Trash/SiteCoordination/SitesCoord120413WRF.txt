 Hi Dan and Greg,<br>
as we all understand the problems that Ivan has now  to run his task in OSG is due the MPI used by WRF in specific way. We will appreciate Rafaelle  consultancy for Ivan how to resolve such problems,

The same time we have very big interest to run in OSG two our other tasks that should not  produce problems to  be run i OSG  because  these tasks does not use MPI and therefore even starting later then Ivan with WRF, we can achieve the successful use of OSG with these tasks quicker then with Ivan's WRF.

I would like to introduce  you  by this email the developers ( both are participating in Ukrainian Grid program and have the  GRID certificates similar to one used by Ivan)

1) Sergey Kivva   skivva@gmail.com<mailto:skivva@gmail.com>  - Hydrological Model  DHSMV

Sergey is  team member  with me ,  Ivan  and Eugene Stakhiv ( IWR, US Army corps of Engineers)  in the  U.S. CRDF Project

Title: Formulating and Evaluating Water Resources Adaptation Options to Climate Change Uncertainty in the Carpathian Region
Ukrainian Institute: Institute of Mathematical Machines & Systems U.S. Institute: Institute of Water Resources

 The primary objective of this project is the formulation and evaluation of water resources adaptation options to climate change uncertainty for flood management, using integrated modeling as a key instrument of river basin
management. This project also aims to provide downscaling of the Panel on Climate Change global climate models for the distributed modeling of the river basins in the Carpathian region and quantify the effects of global climate model scenarios and climate variability on river flow, flooding and flooding forecasts. They will accomplish these objectives by using various database and statistical modeling programs so calculations on regional meteorological scenarios for climate changes until 2050 can be made. The results of this project would have an immediate impact, especially to populations living on the flood prone basins in the Ukraine. Overall this project would further the knowledge on current understandings of the complex interplay between climate change, water resources and flood
management.

Sergey is responsible   modification of the code of the distributed hydrological model of the University of Washington DHSVM
http://www.hydro.washington.edu/Lettenmaier/Models/DHSVM/index.shtml-
 for hindcasting  the floods in 30 years period 1960-1990 in Carpathian watersheds on the basis of the recalculated by Ivan via WRF  precipitation
( these sequences of the prtecipitations has been simulated by Ivan earlier on our small cluster)
Then as Ivan  will calculate several future climate projections vby WRF , Sergey will use DHSVM for future floods calculations .

However just now Sergey has finished the testing and modification of DHSMV code and we need the resource for such 30 years river flow simulation by DHSVM
This code does not use MPI and we do not expect problems for running of this hydrological model in OSG


2) Mykola I  Ilijn    mykola.ilin@gmail.com<mailto:mykola.ilin@gmail.com>  MEDGRID Project

Mykola is a key grid expert inthe executing by our institute  Grid project of the telemedical electrocardiogram (ECG) processing

http://medgrid.immsp.kiev.ua/secondary_pages/home_en.html

The task that he has-  it is processing on huge amount on ECG does not need parallelization and therefore also OSG can be used without  such problems as we have with WRF

We all are interested to achieve ASAP the success in the Ukrainian researchers work in OSG and therefore I am sure that the tasks that   Sergey  KIvva   and Mykola  Iljin run can start to work in OSG rather quickly

Therefore I ask you to open access for Serhy and Mykola to OSG
Ivan  will consult them about the work in this Condor environment, quetion about the access for them

thank you
Mark
