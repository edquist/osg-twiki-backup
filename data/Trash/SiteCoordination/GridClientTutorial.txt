---+ Installing and using the grid client

---++ Preliminaries
This process assumes that you have already obtained a grid certificate from an OSG-recognized Certificate Authority and joined an OSG Virtual Organization. If you have not, you will not be able to use the Grid.You'll need a personal grid certificate to use the installation.

See http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0 for system requirements.  If you do a non-root install, make sure that you own your =$HOME/.globus= directory and its permissions are 755.   

The rest of this document assumes you are in a directory where you'll have enough space to install OSG client (~1.6GB)

---++ Getting Pacman
Here how to download and install Pacman, the main package manager for OSG: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall

<pre>
mkdir pacman
cd pacman
wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-latest.tar.gz
tar zxf pacman-latest.tar.gz
cd pacman-3.29 #Or whatever version may apply
source setup.sh
cd ..
</pre>

---++Installing OSG Client

---++Installing OSG-client

It is recommended to install OSG-client in a local file system (on shared ones the installation may fail due to load). In the example I will use =/scratch/=, a local directory with write access to regular users

<pre class="screen">
source pacman-3.29/setup.sh 
mkdir osg-client
cd osg-client
pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
</pre>
Answer =yall= when asked to trust the caches (you will trust al the caches used in the installation).

The installation should complete with something like:
<pre class="screen">
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.
                                         
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2 has been installed.

More information about installing and using OSG-client is available in the Client Installation Guide: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide

More information on available commands and how to use the OSG Client can be found in the [[http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/ITB/UserTutorial][User tutorial]] and the [[Integration.SimpleCEandClientValidationModule][CE and Client validation section]] both referenced below.
