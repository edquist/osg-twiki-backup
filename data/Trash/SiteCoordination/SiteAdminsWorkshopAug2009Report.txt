---++Feedback on OSG Site Administrators Workshop, Aug 6,7 2009

The OSG Site Administrators workshop was held in Indianapolis on August 6 and 7, 2009. 

Two events influenced the workshop:
   * OSG 1.2, released on track one week before the workshop, was supposed to be the LHC turn-on release, to be deployed quickly on OSG
   *  a sensible growth of the institutions interested in OSG, specially due to the formalization of Tier 3s, small computing center associated with the HEP experiments. 

%BR%
The workshop consisted in a morning of plenary sessions, introducing what's new in OSG 1.2, presenting OSG to the attendees new to it and introducing the following  afternoon  and morning of parallel sessions.

Next time the session introduction could be replaced by a more detailed comparison online and on hand-outs.

%BR%
Based on experience and feedback from previous events, the workshop has been planned as "hands-on".

Faculty had been provided in advance with [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationHandsOn][templates]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationClientInstallationHandsOn][examples]] for TWiki pages and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationHandsOn/OSG_SiteAdmin09Aug.ppt][presentations]]. 
An [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/SiteCoordination/SiteAdminsWorkshopAug2009][internal page]] and a series of meetings coordinated and steered the delivery of programs and material: probably too many phone meetings, attendance to each one was limited.

%BR%
As a result, requirements for each session were available in advance and communicated to site administrators (via email and via a workshop presentation phone meeting 2 weeks before the workshop). 

The event had been advertised as an unique occasion to facilitate the installation or upgrade:  45 registered attendees (we were expecting 30/40), took advantage of the expertise that was available, both from the instructors and from other admins. 
Web streaming with Adobe Connect and phone bridge via ES-NET were both available but few were the remote attendees (less than a handful for each session): this may be improved.

%BR%
The "install-fest" sessions were successful in accelerating the deployment of OSG 1.2, even if not at the level of the Install-fests of the early OSG and Grid3. 
Only 1 production resource had OSG 1.2 before the meeting; several services have been installed during the meeting (at least 6 GUMS servers, 6 Computing Elements and 5 Storage Elements, as from the limited responses to a survey); one day after the workshop 8 OSG 1.2 production sites were "green" in MyOSG.

%BR%
The material produced, covering installations, security, network troubleshooting, virtual machines and monitoring, is available for those who were unable to attend. 

This includes: a series of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationSiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug09][practical guides]] on the TWiki and the presentations and some recording of the sessions, both available in  [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2497][Indico]]. 

%BR%
Some attendees complained about having to choose and being unable to follow two sessions that were running in parallel: they suggested to have longer workshop.

%BR%
Responses to survey were limited: a paper survey available et the event would probably get more responses.

Adobe Connect, a presentation tool, gave mixed results but allowed to record some of the sessions:
having some dedicated hardware prepared in advance (for each session: one computer to present , one for the video, one to record the session) would improve the results. [[%ATTACHURL%/AdobeConnectFeedback.txt][Here]] a more detailed report on the experience Adobe Connect. 

%BR%
According to the attendees. Food/refreshments were excellent. Rooms had some minor problem: auditorium had no power for the laptops and some session was overcrowded and the room too hot (insufficient air conditioning).
Overflow rooms (with video audio-connection) were available but we decided not to use them to allow all the people to be in the same room and interact in person.

---++Short version (OSG news)
Based on experience and feedback from previous events, the August 6 and 7 OSG Site Administrators workshop has been planned as "hands-on", reducing the talks to a single morning plenary to introduce OSG to the new Tier 3 administrators, to describe what's new in 1.2 and to present the parallel sessions.

Faculty had been provided in advance with templates for TWiki pages and presentations and a series of meetings coordinated and steered the delivery of programs and material.  
As a result, requirements for each session were available in advance and communicated to site administrators. Several site administrators, 45 registered, took advantage of the expertise that was available, both from the instructors and from other admins. 
The "install-fest" sessions were successful in accelerating the deployment of OSG 1.2, released one week before and important specially for the LHC experiments. Only 1 production resource had 1.2 before the meeting; several services have been installed during the meeting (at least 6 GUMS servers, 6 Computing Elements and 5 Storage Elements); one day after the workshop 8 OSG 1.2 production sites were "green" in MyOSG.

The material produced, covering installations, security, network troubleshooting, virtual machines and monitoring, is available for those who were unable to attend. 
This includes: a series of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationSiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug09][practical guides]] on the TWiki and the presentations and some recording of the sessions, both available in  [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2497][Indico]].
