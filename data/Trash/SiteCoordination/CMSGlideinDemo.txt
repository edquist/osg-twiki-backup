---+ CMS Glidein Demo

---++ Purpose

While not all of the demonstration can be reproduced without having access to the glidein machines, this document is intended to summarize some of the techniques used that may be of use to site administrators.

---++ Things you can do on CMS Dashboard

A wealth of information can be found at the [[http://dashboard.cern.ch/cms/][CMS Dashboard]].  Here are a few examples.

---+++ Find the Worker Node a User Job Lands On

   1. Click on [[http://dashb-cms-job.cern.ch/dashboard/request.py/jobsummary][Interactive view]]
   1. Select the site of interest from the *any site* pull down menu on the left
   1. Select *GLIDEINS* from *any grid*
   1. Select *sort by user* in the sort options farther down
   1. Click the *submit* button

This shows a list of users below currently running glideins at the site of interest.  If you click on any of the numbers in the columns *Run*, *Term*, *Done*, etc you will get a new page titled *job detailed view* with a table of lots of information.  If you click on the first column, *JobId* you will get even more details.  Of particular use here for admins might be *GridCertificate* to see the user's DN.  On the *job detailed view* the second to last column titled *HostName* lists the worker node.
