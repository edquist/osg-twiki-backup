---++ News and documentation about OSG Release 3 RPMs
In the OSG documentation hub you can find links to the new Release 3 documentation: 
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome

October 10 to the 12 there has been a Documentation meeting at Fermilab and the migration/re-factorization of the OSG documentation on the Twiki:
   * Documents about OSG 1.2 (Pacman version) will remain in the !ReleaseDocumentation web
   * Documents that are considered release independent will move (or have been moved) to the Documentation web
   * Documents about the new RPM based release (namely OSG 3) will be in the web Documentation.Relase3 with a structure similar to the current OSG 1.2 documents in !ReleaseDocumentation

If you experience any dangling link in the current Pacman documents, please report it to us and be aware that the document may have been moved from !ReleaseDocumentation to Documentation.

Some software components (e.g. GUMS) initially will not be available as RPM. Their documentation will remain in the !ReleaseDocumentation web.

Writing all the documentation is a big task. Help in writing, fixing or testing the documents is more than welcome. Check the "Contribute!" box in the Twiki left bar of the Documentation or !ReleaseDocumentation web.

---++ Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
   * To join click on the link in the introduction above.
