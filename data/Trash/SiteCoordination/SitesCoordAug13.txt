---++Deployment status
   * 8 OSG 1.2 in MyOSG
   * more sites may actually be up and running (see pyOpenSSL below)
      * NERSC, Iwona, has 1.2 up local RSV green but is not in MyOSG and not reporting

---++OSG 1.2 deployment issues
   * pyOpenSSL
      * ticket 
         * VDT: http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?id=5653
         * GOC (related): https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=7323
      * sympthom: site is up and green but not reporting to MyOSG
      * hystory:
         * pyOpenSSL is used by Gratia and RSV reporting and not always part of the OS
         * adding pyOpenSSL to VDT fixed Gratia
         * a patch to fix RSV configuration (and reporting) will be ready soon 
      * workaround: install pyOpenSSL in your OS
   * SGE not acknowledged in GIP
      * if probes are not in the path, GIP is not finding SGE
      * workaround: add the job manager to the PATH

---++Planned upgrades
Recommendation for Sites is to update to OSG 1.2.
Current problems are minimal (will not affect jobs or production but only monitoring).
Planned updates:
   * Punam: next Friday, after OS upgrade in the production cluster
