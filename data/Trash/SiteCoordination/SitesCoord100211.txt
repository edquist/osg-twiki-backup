---++Adobe Connect
I will be starting the Adobe Acrobat Connect Pro (AC) meeting at 10:45 for people that use AC for the first time and would like to do some test/practice. AC is a flash application. It is supported best on Windows and OS X. Linux Flash support is not as reliable, it depends on the release.
   * Here is a link to some instruction to get you started: https://admin.adobe.acrobat.com/_a227210/vqs-gettingstartedmeeting/
