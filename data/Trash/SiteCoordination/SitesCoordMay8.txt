---++ Introducing Toni Perez
   * coarasa@cern.ch
   * Joining OSG from UCSD, based at CERN
   * Building some tools, deployed as an rpm
   * Monitors cpu, lsof, other suspect things that indicate problems with the CE; 
   * No. of job managers
   * Writes to a DB, then plots.  Running the scripts for first time today, monitoring response of 10K jobs
   * Tools to stress nodes, when do nodes fail, etc.
   * Questions -
      * What about Monalisa?  Can monitor anything in =/proc=?  Any plans to integrate?   Toni thinks this can be done - Michael will send a link for more documentation, notes Josef is based at cern.
      * Caution from Alan - concerned about adding "yet another monitoring tool".   Worried about adding more work.  (Eg. won't install rpms)
    
---++ Report from OSG Users - Chris/Abhishek
   * We are currently pushing forward with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's validating the next release of OSG (1.0). 
   * OSG Users face-to-face meeting next meeting, at BNL.  New applications, VOs.., see: http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&confId=1683
   * Looking into better ways to help users get access to cycles.
   * Questions
      * Ian: SBGrid - getting ready to submit validation jobs.  Brand new users welcome - will be supported by the OSG users group.
      * Ruth would like an explicit discussion about the apps from the SBGrid in the OSG Users group itself. Need to include Mats, Sebastian / Engagement.

---++  ITB progress and OSG 1.0 preview - Suchandra/Alain
   * Whats new:
      * VDT release is evolutionary - nothing too different - fixes many problems.
      * Improvements across the board.
      * Used to use SSL as linked from Globus, old.  Now - link against the *system SSL*.  Makes difference in the security infrastructure, implied a lot of software upgrades and fixes.  Eg. new version of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.   New version of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMSadmin.
      * Support debian4
      * Condor-cron package - always installed (don't use pre-installed Condor) - which replaces 
      * Upgrades to srm client tools, renamed
      * =vdt-control= - now the one interface to use for turning off/on services
      * CA cert upgrade and fetchcrl processes improved
      * New dCache
      * Updates to RSV - new probes, bug fixes, etc.
      * Lots of other little bug fixes.
   * New configuration method - new script that provides facility to configure site based on a text file without user interaction.  At Sites meeting in december @ fnal, most admins felt answering questions in the old method required lots of time, a limiting factor.  Can configure site offline via a text file.   Can share configurations.  Reduce number of files to be modified.
   * Current in validation testing stage for ITB.
   * Opportunistic storage on the SEs - we have 3,4 sites participating in this.
   * Hope to fix any problems in the information system.
   * Local Gratia collectors - Charles has installed and tested on an ITB 0.9.0 site.  Works.  Encouraged for sites to install this.  Distributes load/capacity for storage records.
   * Configuration challenge - is the simple text file the way to go?  Can we recycle the old configure-osg script (the questions interface)?
      * Main problem noted by Alan is that for Green sites this may be a problem.
      * Better documentation in general
   * Schedule
      * Current target is June 1 for OSG 1.0

---++  Site admins comments/discussion
Open discussion forum, Q&A on any range of topics of interest to OSG site administrators.
   * Version of Condor and incompatibilities with Gratia.   Chris Green is working on a set of probes which will work with Condor 6.9 or better site schedulers.  Need to make this documentation easy to find.  Will send to =osg-sites=.   
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS is advertising a job-manager Condor since its running managed-fork.  Was this fixed?  Thinks patch is in.

---++ AOB
  * Next meeting in about a month.
