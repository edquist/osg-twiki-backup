---+ Engineering Considerations

A %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE% is a selection of software provided by the %LINK_VDT% bundled for the use on the %LINK_OSG%.  A Compute Element provides services to allow grid users to run jobs on a grid resource. The [[ReleaseDocumentation/SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] will help you avoid many of the common problems while installing a new site.

---+ Requirements

   1 new System Administrators should read the [[ReleaseDocumentation/SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]]
   1 execute all steps to [[ReleaseDocumentation/PreparingComputeElement][prepare your Compute Element]]
   1 verify that your Operating System is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]]
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION% or later
   1 a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required

---+ How to get Help?

To get assistance please use [[HelpProcedure][this page]]. 

---+ Installation Procedure

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 deactivate an existing installation
   1 create an installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CE%
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 connect %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% to =managedfork= and your batch system back-end
   1 execute the post installation script

---++ Deactivate an existing Installation

Before you proceed you must [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Service_Deactivation][deactivate]] an existing installation to avoid to have leftover processes. Make sure to start the installation with a clean environment. If VDT_LOCATION is in your environment you probably need to log-in again and make sure that no setup file is sourced in your login script.

---++ Create the Installation Directory

Create an empty installation directory and change into it. Make sure the directory is world readable if the installation is to be shared by grid users: 

<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ mkdir -p %UCL_CWD%
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$ cd %UCL_CWD%
[root@%UCL_HOST% %UCL_CWD%]$ ln -s %UCL_CWD% /opt/osg
</pre>

%WARNING% Please do not use a system directory like =/opt= or =/usr= here. The installation routine will create many sub-directories in the main directory.

---++ Use Pacman to install the Compute Element Software

In the next step we will use the =pacman= command line tool to install the package from the OSG software cache. %LINK_PACMAN% will ask whether you want to "trust the caches and accept the license", answer =yall= and =y= to install Compute Element.

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:ce
Do you want to add [%CACHE%] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
...
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:ce
Do you want to add [%CACHE%] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): %RED%yall%ENDCOLOR%
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                                          


========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

                                                                              
Pacman Installation of OSG-%VERSION% Complete
 </pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

%NOTE% Depending on your network connection and hardware capabilities the installation process will take between 5 and 30 minutes to complete. Meanwhile you can =tail= the main installation logfile =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log=.

%WARNING% Do not continue if the pacman command indicated an error.

---++ Update the Environment

Depending on your shell update your environment by sourcing =%UCL_CWD%/setup.sh= or =%UCL_CWD%/setup.csh=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% . %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh
</pre>

Depending on your preference you might want to optionally include the setup script in your system or user profile.

---++ Connect GRAM to Managed Fork and your Batch System Backend

The Grid Resource Allocation Manager connects to the batch system using a %LINK_GLOSSARY_JM%. By default only the =fork= job manager is supported which allows grid users to execute jobs on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER%. To connect %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM% to an _existing_ batch system, you need to install the _corresponding_ job manager.

---+++ Instructions for Managed Fork

The default job manager =fork= allows grid users to run arbitrary many jobs on the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER%. This may result in dangerous load values which will render the Gatekeeper unusable eventually. The =managedfork= job manager routes incoming =fork= requests through Condor instead, which can be used to restrict the number of jobs executing on the Gatekeeper.

Before you proceed to install the =managedfork= job manager, you may define two environment variables that point to an _existing_ Condor installation and its configuration file. Otherwise _skip_ this step:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION = &lt;Path to Condor&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG   = &lt;Path to Condor configuration file&gt;
</pre>

Then continue to use =pacman= to install the =managedfork= job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:ManagedFork
</pre>


---+++ Instructions for Condor

Before you proceed to install the Condor job manager, you must define two environment variables that point to the _existing_ Condor installation and its configuration file:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION = &lt;Path to Condor&gt;
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG   = &lt;Path to Condor configuration file&gt;
</pre>

Then continue to use =pacman= to install the Condor job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-Condor-Setup
</pre>

%NOTE% By default The Condor job manager located at =%UCL_CWD%/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/condor.pm= will require that all jobs run on nodes of the _same_ architecture as the %LINK_GLOSSARY_GATEKEEPER% architecture. To disable this feature _comment out_ following line in the file above:

<pre class="file">
#    $requirements .= " && Arch == \"" . $description->condor_arch() . "\" ";
</pre>

---+++ Instructions for PBS

Before you proceed make sure that the =$PATH= environment variable contains the path to the binaries for the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System][Portable Batch System]]. Then use =pacman= to install the PBS job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup
</pre>

Otherwise the installation will silently fail and the error will be reported to =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log= only. In this case you must _remove_ the =Globus-PBS-Setup= package, correct the =$PATH= environment variable and install the PBS job manager once again. To remove the =Globus-PBS-Setup= use:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -remove %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup
</pre>

---+++ Instructions for SGE

Before you proceed make sure that the =$PATH= environment variable contains the path to the binaries for the [[http://gridengine.sunsource.net/][SUN Grid Engine]]. Then use =pacman= to install the SGE job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-SGE-Setup
</pre>

---+++ Instructions for LSF

Before you proceed make sure that the =$PATH= environment variable contains the path to the binaries for the [[http://www.platform.com/workload-management/high-performance-computing][Platform LSF]]. Then use =pacman= to install the LSF job manager:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-LSF-Setup
</pre>

---++ Post-Install Procedure

To finalize your installation you must run the =vdt-post-install= program on the command line:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-post-install
Starting...
Configuring PRIMA... Done.
Configuring EDG-Make-Gridmap... Done.
Configuring PRIMA-GT4... Done.
Done.
</pre>

<!-- so far so good -->

---+ *Comments*
| If you have a server certificate but it is expired "vdt-control --on" will start your service but they will not work. Check the gatekeeper log file if you cannot authenticate. | Main.MarcoMambelli | 10 Jul 2009 - 19:15 |
| If the OLD_VDT_LOCATION is set there is no need to run the cert updater by hand, the certs will be handled same way as they were in the old install. I am not sure whether that happens always, but always for me.<br />Also seems to me that the Enabling Full Privilege Authentication is done automatically based on config.ini and the files are placed where they need to be - nothing to be done for it these days.<br /> | Main.IwonaSakrejda | 23 Jul 2009 - 20:54 |
| TAG_TEST = YES | Main.RobertEngel | 14 May 2010 - 17:47 |
| If Condor has been installed via RPM what should VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION be? Or, better, how do I point the condor-jobmanager to it? | Main.MarcoMambelli | 26 May 2010 - 23:44 |
| Above, in the multi-ce section it says &#60;br /&#62;Set the value of site_name in the &#34;Site Information&#34; section to be the same for each CE. &#60;br /&#62;Shouldn&#39;t that be resource_group setting to be the same now, and resource (only used&#60;br /&#62;by gratia) to be different for each &#37;(localhost)s&#60;br /&#62; | Main.StevenTimm | 30 Aug 2010 - 17:57 |
