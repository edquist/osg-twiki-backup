Topics below are marked with either (N) for "new topic" or (O) for "old topic".

We have attempted to sort the topics in priority order, and plan to tackle them top-to-bottom.

   * (O) Current status of federated identity plans/directions for OSG. 
      * This includes current discussions of collaboration with European grid. 

   * (N) Status of OSG plans to provide network-level monitoring across our resources.

   * Report from Technology Investigations to Blueprint Group:
      * Results from TI's that are related to previous Blueprint items.
