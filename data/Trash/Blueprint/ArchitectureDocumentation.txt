---++  Introduction
This document describes the enterprise architecture of the OSG. The primary purpose of describing the architecture of an enterprise is to improve the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the business itself with minimal impact on the operations or agreed-upon SLAs.  There are two eventual goals: to capture the current OSG architecture and to define an architectural direction for the future to meet needs as known today of current and potential stakeholders.  The scope of  "enterprise architecture practice" is the description of the whole enterprise from different perspectives: Business (including the operating model and processes), Information (including the organization’s meta-data), Applications, and Technology (including traditional hardware and software architecture).

This document should not be read standalone.  You will need to read the documents referenced below, as well as related pages on the collaborative TWiki in order to understand the details of the OSG current practices and its status.

We are using the following model of Enterprise Architecture  to guide us: 
   * Describing a “target” or “future state” goal is as important as a detailed description of the status quo. 
   * Architecture focus is to iterate over solution descriptions (end-to-end) rather than components. 
   * Importance of engaging individuals and their interactions in the architecture should be explained (not clear how to do this yet).

We describe the OSG architecture from four enterprise viewpoints:
   * Business 
   * Information
   * Applications
   * Technology

---++ Business Model
The OSG project is built and operated by the OSG Consortium - many autonomous organizations (some of which are virtual ). Consortium members contribute effort and resources to meet the distributed computing infrastructure needs of the members. Research communities, computing resource providers, software development projects, educators and students are members of the Consortium.  Membership is based on registration.  The goal in any enterprise architecture is to bring the business side and the technical side together, so that both work together towards the same targets. 

The business aspects of the OSG are:
   * Goals and Mission. 
   * Capabilities and capacities.
   * Organization and governance.
   * Processes and policies.
