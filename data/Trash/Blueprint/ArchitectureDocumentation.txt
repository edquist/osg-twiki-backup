---++ Goals and Scope
The Open Science Grid (OSG) represents a distributed facility that provides access to computing and storage resources at various locations in the US and abroad. This document describes the enterprise architecture of the OSG. The primary purpose of describing the architecture of an enterprise is to improve the effectiveness and/or efficiency of the business itself with minimal impact on the operations or agreed-upon SLAs. 

There are two goals for this document: to capture the current OSG architecture and to define an architectural direction for the future to meet needs as known today of current and potential stakeholders. 

The scope of the enterprise architecture practice is the description of the whole enterprise from different perspectives: Business (including the operating model and processes), Information (including the organization’s meta-data), Applications, and Technology (including traditional hardware and software architecture).

This document should not be read standalone. In particular more details are given in documents such as the: Introduction to OSG, Charter of the Open Science Grid, and OSG Blueprint (see table below for references). This document is also a snapshot with annual updates. The details in the updated documents from the document repository and from the collaborative TWiki supersede it. You will need to read the above documents, as well as related pages on the collaborative TWiki in order to understand the details of the OSG current practices and its status.
---++ Enterprise Architecture
We are using the following rules  to guide us: 
   * Describing a “target” or “future state” goal is as important as a detailed description of the status quo. 
   * Architecture focus is to iterate over solution descriptions (end-to-end) rather than components. 
   * Importance of engaging individuals and their interactions in the architecture should be explained (not clear how to do this yet).

We describe the OSG architecture from four enterprise viewpoints:
   * Business 
   * Information
   * Applications
   * Technology
