---++  Introduction
This document describes the architecture of the OSG. Our purpose in describing our enterprise is to improve our effectiveness and capabilities, while paying attention to the  impact on current operations and agreements (SLAs).  There are two eventual goals: to capture the current OSG architecture and to define an architectural direction for the future to meet needs as known today of current and potential stakeholders.  The scope of  "enterprise architecture practice" is the description of the whole enterprise from different perspectives: Business (including the operating model and processes), Information (including the organization’s meta-data), Applications, and Technology (including traditional hardware and software architecture).

This document should not be read standalone.  You will need to read the documents referenced below, as well as related pages on the collaborative TWiki in order to understand the details of the OSG current practices and its status.

We are using the following model of Enterprise Architecture  to guide us: 
   * Describing a “target” or “future state” goal is as important as a detailed description of the status quo. 
   * Architecture focus is to iterate over solution descriptions (end-to-end) rather than components. 
   * Importance of engaging individuals and their interactions in the architecture should be explained (not clear how to do this yet).

---++ What we Do and How (Our Business)
The OSG project is built and operated by the OSG Consortium - many autonomous organizations (some of which are virtual ). Consortium members contribute effort and resources to meet the distributed computing infrastructure needs of the members. Research communities, computing resource providers, software development projects, educators and students are members of the Consortium.  Membership is based on registration.  The goal in any enterprise architecture is to bring the business side and the technical side together, so that both work together towards the same targets. 


---+++ Goals and Mission.
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Learn_About_Us/Our_Mission][Current]]:

<i>The Open Science Grid aims to promote discovery and collaboration in data-intensive research by providing a computing facility and services that integrate distributed, reliable and shared resources to support computation at all scales. </i>



Proposed new Mission (in discussion in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Council/CouncilActionItems][Committee see March 2010 Action item 7]]):


<i>The Open Science Grid aims to promote discovery and collaboration in data-intensive research by providing computing services, software and support that integrate cross-domain, self-managed, nationally distributed cyber-infrastructures that bring together campus, community, national and commercial resources to meet the needs of communities at all scales.</i>


The architecture and targets of the OSG are driven by its participating virtual organizations (VOs) – current and potential.  In OSG, a VO refers not only to a collection of people with a shared mission, but also includes the group's computing/storage resources and services. The (three) major VOs that drive the OSG at the time of this writing are the US LHC Collaborations (US ATLAS and US CMS) and LIGO. Currently:
   * The US LHC Collaborations depend on and contribute to the OSG as part of their distributed computing facilities in the US. US ATLAS and US CMS make resources, services and software accessible through the OSG. They implement agreed upon policies for the opportunistic, shared use of these resources by other research communities. They implement policies to bring and share software and services to the common good.
   * LIGO depends on the OSG software stack and experienced collaboration to provide support. The LIGO scientific collaboration federates it’s distributed community facility with, as well as contributes resources accessible through, the OSG. 

OSG itself includes VOs that additionally drive the architecture and targets:
   * The Trash/Engagement community brings a diverse set of users and communities to use the OSG who do not, in general, have their own resources to offer. As these users and communities become self-sufficient they may transition to full stakeholders in the OSG. 
   * The Education community is a small community whose focus is on education and training of students and the workforce. This community is one of the drivers of documentation and training activities. 
   * The OSG community provides an umbrella for OSG staff and any member of the OSG who wants to test, run existing applications as individuals, or provide services for other communities to share.


Target: As part of proving our value, We aim to increase the number of major VOs who benefit from the OSG  as well as the number of communities of all sizes (small to large).
