The OSG Blueprint Group is responsible for the conceptual principles of the Open Science Grid. These are captured in the 
<a href="http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=18&extension=PDF">Blueprint Document</a> available from the Document Repository.

A second responsibility is the Technology Group activity. The draft [[#OSGTechnology][charter]] is shown below.

A third responsibility is for an ongoing series of Blueprint face to face meetings which focus at a conceptual and foundational level on specific aspects of the OSG infrastructure, technologies, operations, architectures and designs.

#OSGTechnology 
---+++ OSG TECHNOLOGY GROUP CHARTER<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

RATIONALE FOR A TECHNOLOGY GROUP<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------

-- The Open Science Grid (OSG) distribution, as a heterogeneous software system consisting of components contributed by a wide range of projects, has no single designer/architect.

-- Because of inter-component functional dependencies, good communication and coordination between component development teams is necessary to avoid problems.

-- A technology working group could help the OSG Technical Director (Miron) by investigating, researching, and clarifying design issues, resolving some questions directly, and summarizing technical design trade-offs so he and the component project teams can make informed decisions. 

-- The OSG software distribution should, ideally,<br>
   1 Function correctly, and be fault tolerant.
   1 Allow easy and flexible deployment and configuration.
   1 Be scaleable for performance, and permit redundancy for reliability. 
   1 Permit good system security, while maximizing simplicity and convenience. 
   1 Allow for change (and interchangeability).
   1 Allow for clean, clear interoperability with other Grids. 
In order to achieve these goals, OSG needs an explicit, documented system design/architecture so that component developers can make compatible design decisions and VOs/users can develop their own applications for the OSG as a platform. 


PURPOSE(S) OF A TECHNOLOGY GROUP<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENT THE CURRENT DESIGN<br>
-- Document the current high-level, end-to-end design of the Open Science Grid software distribution, and in particular specify the functional relationships between components and conceptual models shared by components.

-- Identify areas where relationships between sub-components are in conflict or are not well-defined.

-- Propose definitions and clarifications of the current design.

CREATE A DESIGN ROADMAP<br>
-- Identify future functional and performance goals of the OSG software system.

-- Assist in creating an overall OSG development roadmap which can achieve the defined goals.

-- Advise component developers on plans so they can make their own plans compatible with an OSG roadmap.

PROVIDE ONGOING COORDINATION/ADVICE<br>
-- Assist the Software Tools group/VDT in coordinating and integrating the contributions of the component development teams.

-- Provide ongoing advice to the OSG Technical Director (Miron) about design options and issues.

-- Assist component development teams to adopt best practices and processes to streamline their integration in the distribution.
