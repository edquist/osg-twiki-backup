---+++ Notes from 12/15/06 Meeting at Caltech
These are notes from John McGee that fkw added here so that others can see them as well.

---++++ Discussion on forensics:<br>
 
     Administrator Tool<br>
o        Getting a list of active FQDN at host during delta-T after the fact &#8211; creating this tool is already on the workplan &#8211; UCSD deliverable, with review by Don et al. will appear within year 1

     Central Accounting<br>
o        Getting a list of active FQDN at a site level (rather than a host) during delta-T and after the fact<br>
o        can be done in multiple ways: accounting, authorization &#8211; either way involves work, not sure which approach is best<br>
o        Prefer to not go and bug the sites, but want to look everywhere within the grid<br>
o        Currently, no plan to do anything wrt the site level authorization systems. Thus depend on accounting for now.<br>

    Central Accounting<br>
o        Analyze utilization to spot &#8220;unusual&#8221; patterns<br>
o        On it&#8217;s way, but takes a while, most should be in place within this year (accounting &#8211; not the analysis part)<br>

    Site Admin education<br>
o        Should we do something here?<br>
o        Fold into grid school site admin education program?<br>

    Central log server (a la syslogng, splunk) within a site<br>
o        Michigan tier 2 team is using syslogng<br>
o        Need to make this info queryable with tools better than grep<br>
o        Useful for forensics in addition to troubleshooting<br>
o        standard OSG practice for site to centrally collect logs, then make available as necessary based on events<br>

---++++ Discussion about efficiency of OSG as a grid
We agreed that the problem is largely in the denominator.

---+++ Protecting Services from Overload

Protecting services: 
 
o	environmentally aware s/w<br>
o	service oriented protections<br>
o	check for previous instances<br>

o	Need a default approach to overload protection<br>
o	Require services to protect themselves against overload<br>
o	Need to have cross-protection across services<br>
o	Is unit of a ?machine? appropriate ? can protections be ?firewall access to port? based.<br>

[[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/viewfile/Blueprint/WebHome?rev=1;filename=Places_To_Protect.doc][Places to protect]]

o	Effectiveness and efficiency is different from survival. Worry about survival first<br>
o	All services should have a strategy for scaling<br>
o	All services should have a strategy for when they are overloaded.<br>
o	Evaluate the services for these properties and understand the installed base<br>
o    Defer work on how to propagate responses ?I am overloaded? back through the s/w layers.<br>
o    Have a ?May I please? generic service so that do not have to change existing services in order to put in protection ? <br>
o 	Move to ?JCL like? declarative statements of needed resources and data for work.<br>
o	Services should also have circuit breakers to stop them responding/acting.<br>
o	2 sources of overload: ?pounding from outside? and unintended peak traffic.<br>
o	Could layer a ?palliative? in front of a service. Difficult to maintain as service interface changes.<br> 
o	Worry about serial latencies introduced into complex workflows.<br>
o	Let WS Gram development team know of need to protect against overload.<br>
o	How to define load?<br>
o	How do probes provide service with information to take a decision on overload? <br>
o	What are site admins responsible for? <br>
o	Valuable for client to know that the request is refused because of load.<br>
o	Need this to propagate back to the metascheduler as well.<br>
o	Do load indicators exist in Globus MDS4 and triggers? <br>
