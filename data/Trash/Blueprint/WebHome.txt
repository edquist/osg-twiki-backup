---+ Technology Area

This Trash/Blueprint Twiki web is dedicated to what is now called the Technology Area of OSG. The   
   * The Technology Group activity. Some top-level info appears below, with more in-depth information available from its own page: TechnologyInvestigations
   * The Trash/Blueprint Group activity. This group works to make explicit the conceptual principles of the Open Science Grid. These are captured in the <a href="http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=18&extension=PDF">Trash/Blueprint Document</a> available from the Document Repository.  The group also conducts face to face meetings which focus at a conceptual and foundational level on specific aspects of the OSG infrastructure, technologies, operations, architectures and designs.  

the mail list is [[mailto:osg-blueprint@opensciencegrid.org]] -- any and all questions and contact is welcomed!

---++ Technology Group Activity

---+++ TechnologyInvestigations

As part of the Technology Area's advisory purpose, we are tasked with evaluating new software and systems for potential use by OSG. When stakeholders and/or OSG staff express an interest, we may define a new <i>technology investigation</i>, a targetted, short-term evaluation of new technology or process. This activity is organized by Brian Bockelman, and meets by phone twice monthly. At any one time there are typically 3-5 separate investigations underway, with a normal duration of 3 months. This activity has its own top-level topic page: TechnologyInvestigations

---+++ Technology Communications

One important aspect of the OSG Technology Area is communicating our activities internally and externally in the OSG.  Communication methods include:
   * OSG Technology Blog: http://osgtech.blogspot.com
   * OSG Technology Investigation writeups, uploaded to OSG DocDB.
      * We try to tag these with the label "Blueprints", so they are indexed on this page: http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ListBy?topicid=13
   * Reporting and presenting progress to external organizations, such as the WLCG's GDB.
   * Reporting to the OSG Area Coordinator's meeting.

---+++Background and Charter

The Open Science Grid (OSG) distribution, as a heterogeneous software system consisting of components contributed by a wide range of projects, has no single designer/architect. Because of inter-component functional dependencies, good communication and coordination between component development teams is necessary to avoid problems. The technology working group helps the OSG Technical Director  by investigating, researching, and clarifying design issues, resolving some questions directly, and summarizing technical design trade-offs so he and the component project teams can make informed decisions. 

The OSG software distribution should, ideally,<br>
   1 Function correctly, and be fault tolerant.
   1 Allow easy and flexible deployment and configuration.
   1 Be scaleable for performance, and permit redundancy for reliability. 
   1 Permit good system security, while maximizing simplicity and convenience. 
   1 Allow for change (and interchangeability).
   1 Allow for clean, clear interoperability with other Grids. 
In order to achieve these goals, OSG needs an explicit, documented system design/architecture so that component developers can make compatible design decisions and VOs/users can develop their own applications for the OSG as a platform. 

---+++ Purpose

   * Document the current design
      * Document the current high-level, end-to-end design of the Open Science Grid software distribution, and in particular specify the functional relationships between components and conceptual models shared by components.
      * Identify areas where relationships between sub-components are in conflict or are not well-defined.
      * Propose definitions and clarifications of the current design.
   * Create a Design Roadmap
      * Identify future functional and performance goals of the OSG software system.
      * Assist in creating an overall OSG development roadmap which can achieve the defined goals.
      * Advise component developers on plans so they can make their own plans compatible with an OSG roadmap.
   * Provide ongoing Coordination Advice
      * Assist the Software Tools group/VDT in coordinating and integrating the contributions of the component development teams.
      * Provide ongoing advice to the OSG Technical Director (Miron) about design options and issues.
   * Assist component development teams to adopt best practices and processes to streamline their integration in the distribution. 


---+++ OSG Trash/Blueprint Document

The OSG Trash/Blueprint Document describes the concepts and principles behind the OSG, as well as a description of the OSG Production Grid and the OSG Campus Grids.
