---+++ Notes from 12/15/06 Meeting at Caltech
These are notes from John McGee that fkw added here so that others can see them as well.

   * Discussion on forensics:
     Administrator Tool<br>
o        Getting a list of active FQDN at host during delta-T after the fact &#8211; creating this tool is already on the workplan &#8211; UCSD deliverable, with review by Don et al. will appear within year 1

     Central Accounting<br>
o        Getting a list of active FQDN at a site level (rather than a host) during delta-T and after the fact<br>
o        can be done in multiple ways: accounting, authorization &#8211; either way involves work, not sure which approach is best<br>
o        Prefer to not go and bug the sites, but want to look everywhere within the grid<br>
o        Currently, no plan to do anything wrt the site level authorization systems. Thus depend on accounting for now.<br>

    Central Accounting
o        Analyze utilization to spot &#8220;unusual&#8221; patterns
o        On it&#8217;s way, but takes a while, most should be in place within this year (accounting &#8211; not the analysis part)

    Site Admin education
o        Should we do something here?
o        Fold into grid school site admin education program?

    Central log server (a la syslogng, splunk) within a site
o        Michigan tier 2 team is using syslogng
o        Need to make this info queryable with tools better than grep
o        Useful for forensics in addition to troubleshooting
o        standard OSG practice for site to centrally collect logs, then make available as necessary based on events
