The OSG Blueprint Activity is responsible for: 
   * The conceptual principles of the Open Science Grid. These are captured in the <a href="http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=18&extension=PDF">Blueprint Document</a> available from the Document Repository.
   * The Technology Group activity. The charter is shown below.
   * Blueprint face to face meetings which focus at a conceptual and foundational level on specific aspects of the OSG infrastructure, technologies, operations, architectures and designs.  

the mail list is [[mailto:osg-blueprint@opensciencegrid.org]] -- any and all questions and contact is welcomed!

---+++ Technology Area

<b>Background:</b>

The Open Science Grid (OSG) distribution, as a heterogeneous software system consisting of components contributed by a wide range of projects, has no single designer/architect. Because of inter-component functional dependencies, good communication and coordination between component development teams is necessary to avoid problems. The technology working group helps the OSG Technical Director  by investigating, researching, and clarifying design issues, resolving some questions directly, and summarizing technical design trade-offs so he and the component project teams can make informed decisions. 

The OSG software distribution should, ideally,<br>
   1 Function correctly, and be fault tolerant.
   1 Allow easy and flexible deployment and configuration.
   1 Be scaleable for performance, and permit redundancy for reliability. 
   1 Permit good system security, while maximizing simplicity and convenience. 
   1 Allow for change (and interchangeability).
   1 Allow for clean, clear interoperability with other Grids. 
In order to achieve these goals, OSG needs an explicit, documented system design/architecture so that component developers can make compatible design decisions and VOs/users can develop their own applications for the OSG as a platform. 

<b>Purpose:</b>

   * Document the current design
      * Document the current high-level, end-to-end design of the Open Science Grid software distribution, and in particular specify the functional relationships between components and conceptual models shared by components.
      * Identify areas where relationships between sub-components are in conflict or are not well-defined.
      * Propose definitions and clarifications of the current design.
   * Create a Design Roadmap
      * Identify future functional and performance goals of the OSG software system.
      * Assist in creating an overall OSG development roadmap which can achieve the defined goals.
      * Advise component developers on plans so they can make their own plans compatible with an OSG roadmap.
   * Provide ongoing Coordination Advice
      * Assist the Software Tools group/VDT in coordinating and integrating the contributions of the component development teams.
      * Provide ongoing advice to the OSG Technical Director (Miron) about design options and issues.
   * Assist component development teams to adopt best practices and processes to streamline their integration in the distribution. 

---++++ Technology Investigation

One of the primary tools of the Technology Area is the "Technology Investigation".  These are short, focused investigations into specific pieces of technology.  The technology group attempts to understand and evaluate the technology, then try to determine how it fits into the OSG ecosystem.

Active Investigations:
   * Using iRODS Data Management on the OSG.  http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY-12
   * !OpenStack as a platform HTC.  http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY-6

Possible Future Investigations:
   * Improving monitoring on the OSG (no JIRA).  Put in the proposal, but we have little guidance on what's desired here.
   * Data federations using HTTP.  Requested by ATLAS, but needs a better set of requirements.
   * OASIS: OSG Application Software Install Service.  Requirements document being written.
   * Site-accounting follow-up: measure "EC2-equivalent" cost of running a T2.
   * Improving job isolation: Outline the basics of job isolation, what isolation techniques are used on the OSG, and future work.

Completed Technology Investigations:
   * Improving Site Accounting: http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY-2
   * Glexec usability improvements: http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY-10
   * Using Condor VM universe through the Grid: http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY-4

---++++ Technology Communications

One important aspect of the OSG Technology Area is communicating our activities internally and externally in the OSG.  Communication methods include:
   * OSG Technology Blog: http://osgtech.blogspot.com
   * OSG Technology Investigation writeups, uploaded to OSG DocDB.
      * We try to tag these with the label "Blueprints", so they are indexed on this page: http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ListBy?topicid=13
   * Reporting and presenting progress to external organizations, such as the WLCG's GDB.
   * Reporting to the OSG Area Coordinator's meeting.

---+++ OSG Blueprint Document

The OSG Blueprint Document describes the concepts and principles behind the OSG, as well as a description of the OSG Production Grid and the OSG Campus Grids.
   * Blueprint document in the OSG DocDB: http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18
