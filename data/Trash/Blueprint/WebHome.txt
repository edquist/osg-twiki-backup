The OSG Blueprint Activity is responsible for: 
   * The conceptual principles of the Open Science Grid. These are captured in the <a href="http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=18&extension=PDF">Blueprint Document</a> available from the Document Repository.
   * The Technology Group activity. The charter is shown below.
   * Blueprint face to face meetings which focus at a conceptual and foundational level on specific aspects of the OSG infrastructure, technologies, operations, architectures and designs.

---+++ Technology Group

<b>Background:</b>

The Open Science Grid (OSG) distribution, as a heterogeneous software system consisting of components contributed by a wide range of projects, has no single designer/architect. Because of inter-component functional dependencies, good communication and coordination between component development teams is necessary to avoid problems. The technology working group helps the OSG Technical Director  by investigating, researching, and clarifying design issues, resolving some questions directly, and summarizing technical design trade-offs so he and the component project teams can make informed decisions. 

The OSG software distribution should, ideally,<br>
   1 Function correctly, and be fault tolerant.
   1 Allow easy and flexible deployment and configuration.
   1 Be scaleable for performance, and permit redundancy for reliability. 
   1 Permit good system security, while maximizing simplicity and convenience. 
   1 Allow for change (and interchangeability).
   1 Allow for clean, clear interoperability with other Grids. 
In order to achieve these goals, OSG needs an explicit, documented system design/architecture so that component developers can make compatible design decisions and VOs/users can develop their own applications for the OSG as a platform. 

<b>Purpose:</b>

   * Document the current design
      * Document the current high-level, end-to-end design of the Open Science Grid software distribution, and in particular specify the functional relationships between components and conceptual models shared by components.
      * Identify areas where relationships between sub-components are in conflict or are not well-defined.
      * Propose definitions and clarifications of the current design.
   * Create a Design Roadmap
      * Identify future functional and performance goals of the OSG software system.
      * Assist in creating an overall OSG development roadmap which can achieve the defined goals.
      * Advise component developers on plans so they can make their own plans compatible with an OSG roadmap.
   * Provide ongoing Coordination Advice
      * Assist the Software Tools group/VDT in coordinating and integrating the contributions of the component development teams.
      * Provide ongoing advice to the OSG Technical Director (Miron) about design options and issues.
   * Assist component development teams to adopt best practices and processes to streamline their integration in the distribution.
