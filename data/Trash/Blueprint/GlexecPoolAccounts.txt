---+ User Isolation in Pilot Systems without Payload Authorizations

OSG is working to provide user isolation (having the payload and pilot run as separate Unix user accounts) without having site-level authorization for the payload.  This allows for the pilot system to handle authorizations internally while still providing a sufficient level of security.

This is implemented using a new LCMAPS plugin for =glexec=.

---++ Installation
Start with a working =glexec= installation.

First, install the Nebraska repository RPM:
<verbatim>
rpm -Uhv http://koji.hep.caltech.edu/public/packages/nebraska-release/1.0/1.osg.el5/noarch/nebraska-release-1.0-1.osg.el5.noarch.rpm
</verbatim>

Then, use yum to install:
<verbatim>
yum --enablerepo=nebraska-testing lcmaps-plugins-pool-accounts lcmaps-plugins-tracking
</verbatim>

You will need to update the =lcmaps.db= as mentioned below.

---++ Configuration

An up-to-date example configuration is kept in the [[https://github.com/bbockelm/lcmaps-plugins-pool-accounts/blob/master/README][github repository for the plugin]].
