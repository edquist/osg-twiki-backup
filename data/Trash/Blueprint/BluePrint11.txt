---++ OSG Trash/Blueprint 11/4/2007

The Trash/Blueprint will be 12:00 Tuesday 4th Dec - 12:00 Wednesday 5th Dec.
<br>It will be at the Feynmann Computing Center First floor small conference room.


There are three topics we will focus on :

   * a comparison between LCAS/LCMAPS and PRIMA/GUMS
   * the 30 sites that failed during our security incident test
   * syslog-ng and the security and privacy concerns

If we have time, we may start discussing the OSG policies in general. this is to say that the policies that are in use today and their usage. 


---+++ OSG Authorization Infrastructure - current and future 
GUMS/Prima/SAZ?, LCAS/LCMAPS

Discuss total cost of ownership, make the list, such as 
   * ease of installation and configuration
   * OSG roadmap and how it affects the existing components
   * integration and support in VDT

---+++ syslog-ng in OSG: security and privacy concerns


syslog-ng will only collect log files if the sysadmin explicitly allows it. By default, we configure syslog-ng to collect these files:

$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container-real.log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container.log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/edg/log/edg-mkgridmap.log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/apache/logs/access_log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/apache/logs/error_log<br>
$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/accounting.log<br>
<br>
