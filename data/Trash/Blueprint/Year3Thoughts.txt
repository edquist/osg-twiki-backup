This is a dirty page full of random thoughts to think about with regard to year 3 wbs planning for osg.

---+ Scalability and Reliability

---++ For Compute Element
   * the stuff we emailed about with Ruth, Toni, fkw. This is reasonably well understood.

---++ For Storage Element
   * this needs a lot more thought.

---+ Functionality Follow Through
There's a few loose ends we have started in prior years that need to be completed.

---++ Opportunistic Storage
Find a customer, and push this through to satisfy that customer.
If we can't find a serious customer, drop it.

---++ Accounting
   * We are still lacking the local Gratia repository. Instructions exist, so I'm told, but deployment doesn't.
      * Is this worth it? And if not, why not?
   * Transfer accounting. We don't have it deployed. It might make a lot of sense to have this in the context of trying to understand
      why CPU/wall clock is so poor, and ruling out SE performance as a cause of it.

---++ Storage Authz
   * When we designed this we envisioned something that we never achieved because the underlying filesystem (pnfs) didn't support it.
      We could revisit this with Chimera
      * start with a performance and functionality evaluation.
      * based on eval, decide if this is ready, or should be dropped because it's too much effort, still.

---++ Operations
   * We need to be able to electrnically determine if a site is up or down, based on RSV and downtime announcement.
   * The site admins need to be educated about the tools available, and if those tools aren't up to snuff, then we need to improve them.
      * independent announcement of SE vs CE downtimes.
