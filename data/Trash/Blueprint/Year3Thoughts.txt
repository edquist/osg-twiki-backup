This is a dirty page full of random thoughts to think about with regard to year 3 wbs planning for osg.

---+ Scalability and Reliability

---++ For Compute Element
   * the stuff we emailed about with Ruth, Toni, fkw. This is reasonably well understood.

---++ For Storage Element
   * this needs a lot more thought. The basic reason for putting it here is the following (excerpt from fkw's SciDAC 2008 paper):
<pre>
In grand total, slightly more than 50\% of the 1.5 Million jobs submitted were recorded as successfully completed.
To understand the origin of the failures, we did a controlled experiment during the month of May 2008..
We identified eight datasets, one from each Tier-1 plus CERN, and asked all Tier-2's to download at least one of them.
We then verified write access to storage at each Tier-2 for output storing. A standard, well tested application was then run at the 40
participating Tier-2. A total of 230k jobs succeeded throughout the month, as compared to 44k failures.
When analyzing the logfiles of all jobs, we found that the failures are predominantly due to storage problems at sites.
In most but not all cases, those problems are detected and fixed by the site admins within 24 hours. However, during those 24 hours,
many more jobs fail than could possibly succeed during the same timeframe because a job that fails in its storage access is very
short. When ignoring storage failures, the success rate in this exercise is better than 99\% .
</pre>

---+ Functionality Follow Through
There's a few loose ends we have started in prior years that need to be completed.

---++ Opportunistic Storage
Find a customer, and push this through to satisfy that customer.
If we can't find a serious customer, drop it.

---++ Accounting
   * We are still lacking the local Gratia repository. Instructions exist, so I'm told, but deployment doesn't.
      * Is this worth it? And if not, why not?
   * Transfer accounting. We don't have it deployed. It might make a lot of sense to have this in the context of trying to understand
      why CPU/wall clock is so poor, and ruling out SE performance as a cause of it.
   * There's a WLCG requirement to have space usage accounting. I'm told that none of what exists actually is the least bit reliable.
      We should follow up on this, and first take stock of what exists, then figure out how to make it reliable.

---++ Storage Authz
   * When we designed this we envisioned something that we never achieved because the underlying filesystem (pnfs) didn't support it.
      We could revisit this with Chimera
      * start with a performance and functionality evaluation.
      * based on eval, decide if this is ready, or should be dropped because it's too much effort, still.

---++ Operations
   * We need to be able to electrnically determine if a site is up or down, based on RSV and downtime announcement.
   * The site admins need to be educated about the tools available, and if those tools aren't up to snuff, then we need to improve them.
      * independent announcement of SE vs CE downtimes.
