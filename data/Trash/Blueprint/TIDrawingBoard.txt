Potential Future Investigation Topics:
   * Information Systems: http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY-14 .  After the continued failure of the BDII5 technology, we'd like to evaluate alternate information system approaches for the GOC.
   * Using HTTP for Data Federations.
      * Get firm set of requirements from BNL.
      * Try to better understand the UC3 use case.
   * Campus Grids:
      * Expand the CGF to multi-user.
      * Improve automated debugging capabilities of Condor flocking.
      * Build on the multicast !JobRouter to make Condor factory.
      * Data-sharing via parrot.
   * Cross-CE: $OSG_APP via parrot in glideins (ties in with AAA project).
   * Load-balanced !GridFTP servers (to reduce the dependency on SRM).
   * Site accounting follow-up: measure the costs of running a LHC T2 site.
