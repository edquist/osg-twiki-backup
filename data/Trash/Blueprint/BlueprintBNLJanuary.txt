---+++ OSG Technology
   * Quarterly update of the Blueprint Document 1 week before the Blueprint meeting
   * Report from Technology Investigations to Blueprint Group:
      * Results from TI's that are related to previous Blueprint items
      * Plans for future TIs ([[TIDrawingBoard][brainstorming area]])
      * Requests from Blueprint Group for TIs (or vice-versa)?  Requests from Technology:
         * Work on OSG's definition of "data federation".
         * Firm up requirements for HTTP data distribution work.
   * How do we coordinate with XSEDE TIS?
   * How do we provide better guidance to OSG ET on the roadmap for future TI's?

---+++Old Topics

   * Investigation of potential replacement technologies for Information Services

This would include the GLUE data transport (Currently CEMon client and collector), the DB where information is stored (LDAP DB), and data retrieval (OpenLDAP). Are we using the right tools, are the stable and robust enough for a growing production environment, what do we want out IS to look like moving into the future?

   * Shared Data 

Where are we from a Blueprint perspective? Any updates on our previous thinking?

   * Current status of cloud computing plans/directions for OSG. 

There is the already expressed concern by Miron about how/whether OSG should be involved in the financial side of Cloud usage.

   * Current status of federated identity plans/directions for OSG. 

This includes current discussions of collaboration with European grid. 

---+++New Topics
   * Campus Grid plans.

   * Reducing/removing the need for Worker Node host certificates in OSG

   * Is it time to revisit the "Grid User" identity concept?

The implications of allowing grid users to assume they will always run as the same UNIX user at a site. Recycleable pool accounts vs. permanent mapping? VOMSAdmin 2.6.1 "multi-cert user" feature and its interaction with GUMS. How does this interact with Federated ID schemes?

   * VO software installation at OSG sites. 

Inclusion strategies for VO software (CVMFS vs. $OSG_APP vs. OSG RPMs vs. VO-maintained RPMs.) Current discussions of how to handle the EPEL RPM repository dependencies of OSG software would probably fit in here as well. 

   * Central scheduler/Cross-CE issues and implications.

   * Potential role and coordination with the Internet2/PerfSonar Monitoring Dashboard (Tomasz/BNL). 

We looked into integrating this with RSV/Gratia, but there are incompatibilities. These could be worked out with coordination. 

---+++ Wrap-up

At the end of the blueprint meeting, we should reach the following goals:
   1 Have a handful of TI's "queued up".
   1 Accept or reject the writeups for the TIs in "documentation" state.
   1 Accept or reject the OSG Blueprint document updates.
