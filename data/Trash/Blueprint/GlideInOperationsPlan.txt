---+ Glide In Operations Plan

---++ Introduction

During the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Blueprint/BlueprintProvisioning][Provisioning Blueprint Meeting]] in November 2013 OSG Operations was tasked with analyzing the make up of OSG Glide In Factory provisioning and support. The goal was to determine if separation of provision tasks and support tasks could lead to more efficient Glide In Factory operation. 

---++ Current Effort Distribution

Effort Distribution Chart 

| Time Period | Site Support (1) | Problem Discovery (2) | Routine Ops (3) | VO Interactions (4) | Overhead (5) | R&D (6) | Total |
| Week of 12/2/13 | 0.18 | 0.20 | 0.20 | 0.11 | 0.20 | 0.18 | 1.07 | 
| Week of 12/9/13 | 0.36 | 0.06 | 0.17 | 0.12 | 0.14 | 0.10 | 0.95 | 
| Week of 1/6/14 | 0.16 | 0.11 | 0.24 | 0.10 | 0.13 | 0.20 | 0.94 | 
| Week of 1/13/14 | 0.17 | 0.26 | 0.14 | 0.06 | 0.16 | 0.24 | 1.03 | 
| Week of 1/20/14 | 0.21 | 0.19 | 0.04 | 0.13 | 0.14 | 0.32 | 1.02 | 
| Week of 1/27/14 | 0.21 | 0.10 | 0.13 | 0.13 | 0.12 | 0.31 | 1.01 | 
| Week of 2/3/14 | 0.29 | 0.11 | 0.15 | 0.08 | 0.10 | 0.25 | 0.97 | 
| Weekly Average | 0.23 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.10 | 0.14 | 0.23 | 1.00 |

All numbers are FTE effort counts. Raw data was provided by the Glide In Operations group at UCSD and is summarized for this chart. 

   1 Effort from the point of creating a site ticket to resolution. 
   2 Troubleshooting and information gathering to prepare ticket creation. 
   3 Following errors to find potential problems. (Some automation may be possible.)
   4 Human interaction with VO front end operators. Includes front end configuration assistance, troubleshooting and advise. 
   5 Interactions with distributed operations, issue turnover and group meetings. 
   6 Testing new releases and configurations. Debugging and development of tools. 

---++ Recommendations

OSG Operations should consider what portion of this effort can only be accomplished by the Glide In Operators and which portion could be considered Site Support which can be done under the support umbrella and whether this separation is more or less efficient. 

---++ Transition Plan

The OSG Blueprint group also requested a plan to transition effort if a separation proves more efficient. A placeholder for this document is at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Blueprint/GlideInTransitionPlan][Transistion Plan]].
