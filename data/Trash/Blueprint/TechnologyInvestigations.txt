The technology investigations area works with OSG stakeholders to do short-term evaluations of proposed technologies for the OSG.  If a technology is evaluated positively, OSG-TI will participate in the rough integration prior to handing off to the appropriate area.  The technology group attempts to understand and evaluate the technology, then try to determine how it fits into the OSG ecosystem.

OSG-TI's work is done using the "investigation format". Each investigation will have
   1 One or more individuals assigned to the investigation. 
   1 A clear description of the concrete goal of the investigation (e.g. a feasibility writeup, a proof-of-concept prototype, a refined proposed design, etc.)
   1 An associated JIRA ticket: http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/TECHNOLOGY

---++ Proposed Investigations

[[TIDrawingBoard][Brainstorming and Future Projects]]

Possible Future Investigations:
   * GFFS - Global Federated File System, as deployed by XSEDE.
   * Site-accounting follow-up: measure "EC2-equivalent" cost of running a T2.
   * Follow-up to Condor-CE.  Potential work plan being drafted for OSG-ED.
   * Data federations using HTTP.  Requested by ATLAS, but needs a better set of requirements.
