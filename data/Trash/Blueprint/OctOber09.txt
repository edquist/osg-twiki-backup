---++ Incremental Software Updates in OSG

An Incremental Software Update in OSG is defined as:
   * Updating a piece of software
   * Addressing  the configuration issues: 
      * Preserving the configuration to what is was prior to the update
      * Updating the configuration to reflect new options
   * Issues of State of the running components
      * Preserving
      * Update



In FY09 the Task related to this was:

1.1.3.1.1	 No	 VDT 2.0 Emphasis will be on improving Pacman packaging to better support incremental updates. The timeline for this is influenced by LIGO’s need for Debian support in February.	 Roy	 1/21/09	 3/31/09	 100%


This now includes:

Shutdown the services - by hand.

Support for Rollback
   * Backup
   * Restore
   * Cleanup
   * Removal of New Version

What about updating a Service ? 

VDT-UPDATER script Updates One Component:
(http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/vdt-updater-instructions.html)
Today works on all Pacman packaged components ie not dCache.

You are expected to turn all VDT services off. It is a future goal to investigate hot updates.
   * Save the Configuration
   * Delete the Configuration
   * Fetch New - Can only get the latest version as defined by VDT. Downloaded from the VDT website (http:). No security, no checksumming, no mirroring. 
   * Install/setup new component
   * Update Configuration
   * Restart


Issues and Concerns: 
   * VDT-UPDATER - people have to update all Components to the newest versions or none of them. 
   * 2 weeks effort to enable selection of components to update. 
   * Do we need a compatabality table? 
   * Can we have an RSV probe that records VDT component versions running on a site. 
   * Expectation can be whether RSV tests are all working.
   * Monolithic approach ?
   * When install one component the configuration script is a dependency in terms of the definition of a "component", it stops/restarts. 

Native Packaging support for Update at the moment:

The updater instructions are available for Native Packaging as well. 



---+++ Configuration
   We are tabling the discussion of Configuration Management for now. This is a hard problem; there are commercial tools that can be applied; what are the Site needs. 

---+++ Tier-3 program of work effort needs - Dan

1.0 Create and maintain ATLAS and CMS T3 baseline docs (0.5FTE for 6 months)<br>
Identify 2 T3 sites as models for Atlas and for CMS<br>
1.1 Create a CMS T3 baseline configuration based on best practices<br>
1.1.1 Package the configuration in an easy to access/use manner for CMS<br>
1.2 Same for Atlas<br>
1.3 Develop/maintain expertise in cluster management tools (Rocks/CFEngine)<br>
1.4 Develop/maintain expertise in Xrootd installation<br>
1.5 Retest T3 installation guides for both CMS and Atlas as the stack changes<br>

2.0 Target OSG system usability issues (0.5FTE for 1 year) -- User in this case refers to a T2 admin<br>
2.1 Collect and maintain a prioritized list/database of usability problems<br>
2.2 Distribute, manage issues sent to product teams to address.<br>
2.3 Explore, pull together existing tools for distribution to the community<br>
