---+!! OSG Cyber Security

%TOC%

---++ Security Office
Don Petravick is the OSG Security Officer with responsibility for developing the cyber security plan
and enssuring that it is executed.
---+++Security Plan
The OSG Security Plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG-Doc-389]]) 
is one of the deliverables of the OSG project jointly funded by DOE and NSF.
The first accepted version of the plan is delivered and may be revised in the future.  Such revisions may be developed at SecurityPlanning.

---+++ Risk Assessment
The security group has made a first pass at risk assessment and the resulting document is (someplace).

---+++ Incident Response and Planning
A discovered security incident must be *immediately* reported to GOC via email and/or phone.  Email contacts are: security@opensciencegrid.org and/or abuse@opensciencegrid.org. The GOC phone number is +1 317-278-9699. In addition, a ticket to GOC can also be submitted. 

In  your email to GOC (security@opensciencegrid.org), the following information must be included at a minimum: 

the name of the responders;

phone; 

alternate phone; 

e-mail address;

Grid Virtual Organization (VO);

whether your grid identity been compromised; 

incident description, including time(s), systems involved and their description; 

any other additional information, e. g. contacts, etc.

An incident response plan for the Open Science Grid is available at [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=19&version=2&filename=OSG_incident_handling_v1.0.pdf][this link]]. 

---+++ Security Email Lists
All email lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain. 

*tg-security* provides communication among, OSG, OSG partners and external collaborators. The current list of members have not been changed. This list includes public data. This list will be used for announcements to our partners and will have a decreased workload compared to the past. OSG staff's day-day discussion will be removed from this list and moved to the security-discuss-l.

*security-discuss-l* (also known as *security-discuss-OSG_LIMITED_DISTR*) provides communication among OSG Security team and related OSG Staff. This list is to discuss OSG security team's day-day activities and internal planning.  This list includes limited data, which is only related to OSG business. The limited data is classified as any data that should only be accessed by an authorized group of individuals. The recipients of limited data can re-distribute to third parties if the first recipient deems the third party trustworthy and the re-distribution does not break the use care agreement between the first recipient and the data owner. 

*security-discuss-restricted* provides communication among OSG Staff. This list only includes restricted data. Restricted data has more stringent access requirements than the limited data: restricted data has a precise list of authorized individuals and re-distribution to third parties is not allowed. This list is used for discussing security vulnerabilities and emergencies. This list is not for general discussion, and the frequency of usage must be relatively low with respect to other lists. Therefore, an email message coming through this channel must be immediately noticed and paid attention. 

*security* and *abuse*: Are the standard email addresses for public reporting of security incidents. Mail to these addresses is received by the iGOC OSG Operations Support Center. The 24x7 iGOC filters the mail for SPAM or other off-topic content, opens or updates a security incident ticket, and forwards the orginal e-mail along with ticket information to the INCIDENT-REPORT-L or INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L lists as appropriate (see below). The iGOC acts immediately on all mail incoming to this address.

*incident-report-l* is a closed list comprised of the primary grid security contacts for all sites and support centers. The list is intended solely for initial incident reporting - not for incident discussion. All email to this list is echoed to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L and mail REPLY TO: is configured to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L. Because this list is restricted solely to the initial reporting of an incident, inbound communications to this list can be used to drive alerting mechanisms - e.g. alarms in support centers, level-1 messages to Blackberrys, etc. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.


*incident-discuss-l* is a closed list comprised of the same members as INCIDENT-REPORT-L plus other grid security contacts who are concerned with incident discussion. The list is intended for discussion of reported incidents. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.


---+++ Awareness and Training Program
The OSG Security Plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG-Doc-389]]) describes the topics and purpose for security awareness and training for people involved with OSG.
There are two relevant [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html][NIST documents]] that provide guidelines for developing computer security awareness and training programs,
which are [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-50/NIST-SP800-50.pdf][NIST SP800-50]] and 
[[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-16/800-16.pdf][NIST SP800-16]].  
At present, this program is [[Security.SecurityPlanning#Developing_the_Awareness_and_Tra][being developed.]]

---++Security Technical Group

The Security Technical group is responsible for coordinating the OSG activities that relate to security policy, practices and services. These include:

   * Negotiation of common security principles and expectations for security across the Consortium.
   * Development and oversight of common requirements and architecture for security management across the Consortium.
   * Identification of necessary projects and work needed for a coherent, complete Security infrastructure on the common grid.
   * Published information about storage resources, including monitoring information, and agreements for their use.
   * Interoperability of Security infrastructure across different
      administrative domains, initially OSG and EGEE through the LCG Joint Security Group.

The chairs are Bob Cowles and Jed Dobson. Group membership is approximated by the current membership of the tg-security mailing list. (Send mail to listserv@fnal.gov, leave subject blank, add message contents: REVIEW TG-SECURITY to see current membership.) This list is open to general participation.  You can join or leave the list or review its previous messages via the list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/tg-security.html][archive page]] if desired.

---++Policy Development

---+++ JSPG

OSG participates in the Joint Security Policy Group with EGEE/WLCG/NDG in developing policies.  As specific policy documents are approved by OSG they will appear linked to the main OSG Policies [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Getting_Started/Policies][web page]].  The list of working documents of the JSPG are at http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj-lcg-security/documents.html.

---+++ Policies and Procedures

The JSPG documents are meant to apply to all grid infrastructures, that adopt them,
and each individual Grid is responsible for the procedures it needs to implement those policies.
There are as well some policies that OSG may develop that could eventually become JSPG documents.
The PolicyandProcedureTable is intended to represent that status of OSG policies and procedures
as they are developed and approved by the OSG and JSPG.


---+++VO Privilege Project

The VOPrivilegeProject is developing and implementing finer-grained authorization for access to grid-enabled resources and services in order to improve user account assignment and management at grid sites, and reduce the associated administrative overhead.



---++Related Activities and Projects

---+++ OSG Registration Authority

The main URL for the OSG RA is [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra][www.opensciencegrid.org/ra]] and 
there is a [[OsgRaOperations][TWiki page]] associated with operational and planning information.

---+++ OSG - LIGO collaboration on identity management & authorization
A working group was set up in June 2006 to define workplan and goals for the OSG RA, Privilege Project, OSG Ops and LIGO so that OSG and LIGO efforts are optimized and meet the functional needs of LIGO.  A working area for this effort is located [[OsgLigoIdAuthz][here]].
