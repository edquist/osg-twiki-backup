---+ About this document

This page is an overview of the installation and testing procedure for a Storage Element (SE) on the Open Science Grid's Integration Test Bed.  It's intended for ITB participants that will be setting up a SE for the ITB. 

%EDITTHIS%
%BR%

---+ Introduction
An ITB  site administrator may install a SE software available from ITB cache that includes the following solution:
   * [[http://www.dcache.org][dCache]]
   * %LINK_BESTMAN% on top of the local disk or  distributed file system

---+ SE Installation
---++ !BeStMan
%INCLUDE{"Bestman" section="IntorductionGeneric"}% 

Distribution package is available through [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu][VDT]] pacman installation as well as tar file download from [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman][SDM group at LBNL]].  The detailed documentation on installation and configuration of various types of !BeStMan is available at:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.Bestman][Preparing, Installing and Validating BeStMan]] 
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanOnCE][Preparing, Installing and Validating BeStMan on Compute Element Node]] 
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway][Preparing, Installing and Validating BeStMan-gateway]] 
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGatewayXrootd][Preparing, Installing and Validating BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd]] 

---++ dCache

[[http;//www.dcache.org][dCache]] is a storage element implementation that meets the [[http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg][SRM v2.2]] specification. dCache is not packaged with the base [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu][Virtual Data Toolkit]] installation, but is available through the VDT as a separately [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html][downloadable package]]. In addition, OSG provides Gratia probes for site and grid-wide monitoring, useful scripts that allows to simplify dCache mentenance as well as a suite of test scripts to validate a dCache installation as well.

For more information please check [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/DCache][this document]].

---++ SE Validation
You will need to verify that the Storage Element is functional you will need to have access to [[ReleaseDocumentation./ClientInstallationGuide][srm client commands]] and be able to create a proxy certificate (==grid-proxy-init== or ==voms_proxy_init command==) and have access to your certificate and private key. 

---+++ %BESTMAN% Validation
In order to validate your %BESTMAN% installation, please, follow instructions provided in  the corresponding documentation:
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGateway#Validation_of_Service_Operation][BeStMan-gateway validation]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.Bestman#Validation_of_Service_Operation][BeStMan-fullmode validation]]
   * [[ReleaseDocumentation.BestmanGatewayXrootd#Validation_of_Service_Operation][BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd validation]]

---+++ dCache Validation
In order to validate dCache, please, follow instructions provided  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/DCache#Validation_of_Service_Operation][here]].

---+++ Registration for SRM !EndPoint Monitoring at LBNL

To register your SE with LBNL Monitoring system:
go to http://datagrid.lbl.gov/sitereg/
and follow the instructions to register. 

Daily functional monitoring for all SRM interfaces is done around 9am Pacific time.
