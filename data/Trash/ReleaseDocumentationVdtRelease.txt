---+ Software versions, Software caches, and the VDT, oh my!

---++ About this document
This document attempts to clarify three things:
   1. The relationship between the OSG software stack and the VDT
   1. The relationship between software versions and software caches
   1. Details about the current software versions and software caches.

---++ The OSG Software Stack and the VDT

The [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/][Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT)]] is a project within the OSG. The VDT provides the the majority of the software you install when you install any portion of the OSG software stack. However the two software stacks are distinct. The VDT attempt to be grid-agnostic and it should be installable by other grids. The OSG software stack is a subset of the VDT with the addition of OSG-specific configuration. For instance, the OSG-specific configuration includes things like:
   * The location of the servers that store information about VO membership (VOMS servers)
   * The names of the servers that collect accounting information
   * .... and more

Therefore at any given time, we can talk about the version of the OSG software stack and the version of the VDT software stack. For example, OSG version 1.2.13 corresponds to VDT version 2.0.0p20. 

---++ Software caches

A _software cache_ is a place where we keep all the software so you can download it and install it. You can think of it like a _YUM repository_ if you're familiar with that. 

To match the fact that we have separate versions of the OSG software stack and the VDT software stack, there are separate software caches for them. However, the OSG software stack refers to the VDT software stack for most of the software that is installed. 

For most of the software in the OSG software stack (dCache is a notable exception), we use Pacman to install software. The Pacman software cache is a set of web-accessible documents. To be more precise than our vague description above: This set of descriptions combined with the software itself is called a _software cache_. 

In general you do not need to understand the details of a Pacman description for installing software, but if you are curious you can see some examples.

   * The VDT's description of how to install Squid: %VDT_CACHE_URL%/Squid.pacman
   * The OSG's description of how to install the Computing Element: %OSG_CACHE_URL%/ce.pacman

---++ Location of the Caches
   * The OSG Production software cache is at: %OSG_CACHE_URL% %BR%
   * The OSG ITB software cache is at: %ITB_CACHE_URL% %BR%
   * The OSG VTB software cache is at: %VTB_CACHE_URL% %BR%
   * The VDT software cache for VDT %VDT_VERSION% (used in this OSG software release) is at: %VDT_CACHE_URL% %BR%
   * Contents of the VDT software cache: %VDT_DOCS_URL%/contents.html

---++ Information about VDT %VDT_VERSION%
OSG %OSG_VERSION% is based on VDT %VDT_VERSION%.
