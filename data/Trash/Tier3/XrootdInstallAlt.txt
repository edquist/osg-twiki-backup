---++ Introduction
Xrootd is a high performance network storage system widely used in high energy physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. The underlying Xroot data transfer protocol provides highly efficient access to ROOT based data files.  This page provides instructions for a simple, relatively small-scale xrootd storage system consisting of:
   * One redirector node
   * One or more data server node(s)
More advanced deployment options including larger scale systems (larger than a few TB per data server) are covered below.


---++ Getting Started

---+++ Identify hosts and roles
   * Identify the redirector node. 
   * Identify the data server(s)

---+++ Check firewall rules

---+++ Create xrootd user account

---+++ Install Pacman

---++ Installing and configuring the redirector

---++ Installing and configuring the data server(s)

---++ Testing your system

---++ Advanced installation options
---+++ Optimizing disk partitions for performance

---+++ Adding a data server
