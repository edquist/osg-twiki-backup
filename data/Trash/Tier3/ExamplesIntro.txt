---+!! Tier 3 How-To
%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC%

---++ Introduction
This document lists some typical Tier 3 installation. Each of them is a end-to-end description of how to install a Tier 3 and references the documents in ModulesIntro for the details on how to install and configure all the components.
If you are new to Grid computing and need a didactic introduction you can use ConceptsIntro.

---++ Example Tier 3 Installations    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
This section contains examples of Tier 3 installations using the components presented in the previous section. Each Tier 3 may have its own unique needs. These are examples that can be customized changing what necessary.

Before starting the installation is important to be familiar with the possible components and to choose what you like and what will fit your Tier 3.

---+++ Small Tier 3 on a private network
This cluster includes few nodes in a batch queue managed with Condor, one or more interactive nodes, a Conpute Element and a Storage Element. It relies on a shared file system provided by a NFS server. All nodes have Scientific Linux 5.4. Here is a map of the nodes
   * =gc1-hn= (=gc1-ce=) =192.168.192.51= the head-node for the queue and also the Compute Element 
   * =gc1-nfs=  =192.168.192.51= the NFSv4 server
   * =gc1-se= =192.168.192.52= the Storage Element 
   * =gc1-ui001= =192.168.192.61= a user interface machine, can also be referred to as Interactive node 1
   * =gc1-wn001= =192.168.192.101= Worker Node 1
   * =gc1-wn002= =192.168.192.102= Worker Node 2 ...
   * =gc1-wnNNN= =192.168.192.&lt;N+100>= Worker Node N (N<154)
<!--
   * =gc1-xrdr.yourdomain.org= the xrootd redirector 
   * =gc1-gums.yourdomain.org=  the GUMS server

---+++ Simple frontend nodes
You may have already your local cluster with a job queue and its own file system and may be interested in connecting it to the Grid. These examples provide a CE and SE that provide a Grid frontend for your local environment.

[[ExampleFrontendInstall][Read more on the installation of this frontend.]]

---+++ Grid infrastructure
[[InfrastructureInstall][Here]] there are examples of installation of infrastructure services, e.g. VOMS.


---+++ Contributed examples
System administrators and VOs are encouraged to add here links to their instruction sets and their Tier 3 installation.
