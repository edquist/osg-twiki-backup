---+!! *<nop>%SPACEOUT{Bestman-Gateway Installation Guide}%*
%TOC%

---++Introduction
!BeStMan-Gateway/Xrootd implements SRM v2.2 for generic posix file systems and provides storage that spans on multiple file systems. The more detailed information about !Bestman-Gateway could be found [[BestmanGateway][here]].
This document is written for system administrators who are planning to use storage that is installed on top of !Xrootd distributed file system. The goal of this document is to give enough information for system administrators to do initial simple configuration of the storage as well as provide references to the documents that may help to accomplish more sophisticated configuration.

The installation of !Xrootd is described in [[XrootdInstall][that document]].
---++++++!!Applicable Versions
This document applies to an install of 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.4* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---++++++!!Engineering Considerations
!BeStMan-Gateway/Xrootd storage could be installed on one node and the installation  consists of the components listed below.  All the required components but FUSE can be installed from %CACHE%: 
   * !BeStMan-Gateway is an implementation of SRM v2.2 for essential interfaces to disk based storage systems - [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman][BeStMan Home Page]] 
   * !XrootdFS -  is a Posix filesystem for an Xrootd storage cluster ([[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/xrootdfs.html XrootdFS Home Page]] ), is required for !BeStMan to work with  Xrootd  
      *  !XrootdFS requires installation of FUSE -   [[http://fuse.sourceforge.net File System in User Space]]. 
   * !GridFTP-Xrootd server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp][GridFTP documentation]]. It is recommended that multiple !GridFTP-Xrootd instances on different servers if:
      * You are serving the VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and have more than 250 cores
      * Your site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space
      * You r site have more than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one !GridFTP server per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the server) if you want to maximize throughput. 
   * optional package
      * Gratia gridftp transfer probe - cron job that reports all the file transfers to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector Gratia collector]]
      *  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS server]] - authorization service

---++Checklist
   1. !FUSE is a kernel module that intercepts and services user requests to the !XrootdFS.  It should be installed before you start !Bestman-Gateway/Xrootd installation. !FUSE can be installed via “yum install” or rpms. You will need three packages: 
      * fuse
      * fuse-libs
      * kernel-module-fuse

or you can download it  from   
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121684&package_id=132802 and build according to instructions  provided at http://fuse.sourceforge.net.   
 
You will need to have root access to install it. 
It is essential that FUSE version ( &gt; 2.7.3) and flavor match your kernel. Contact your sys admin if you have any questions.

   1. [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >= %PACMAN_VERSION% is required
   1. The server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security/=
   1. !BeStMan server needs to have a valid host certificate installed in =/etc/grid-security/bestmancert=. The certificate should be own by a user that is running !BeStMan server. The right permission (600) should be set on those files. %ICON{warning}%  !BeStMan should be configured with host certificate in order to be able to handle requests from !LCG-Utils tools. This is mandatory for at least all !BeStMan servers that support ATLAS experiment. Normally the OSG !BeStMan implementation uses a service certificate, not a host certificate. This causes lcg-cp to fail because the certificate name (which looks like http/hostname instead of just hostname) doesn't match the hostname. 
   1. The firewall must allow incoming connections to the !GridFTP port (default 2811). Outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.
   1. A working GUMS server or a gridmap-file are needed for authorization using grid certificates.

---++Installation Procedure

Login as root and set up  pacman, make sure that >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is installed:

<pre class="screen">
su root
. &lt;PACMAN_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
pacman -version
</pre>

Next create and change to an installation directory. This directory will later be used to get the !BeStMan package  from the %CACHE% cache.
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/%OSG_VERSION%-bestman-xrootd/
cd /opt/osg%OSG_VERSION%-bestman-xrootd/
</pre>
You will first install !XrootdFS package
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get ITB:XrootdFS 
</pre>
Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=) and whether you want to accept the license (=y=).
After you have installed !XrootdFS you should execute pacman to get the !BeStMan package from the %CACHE% cache. 
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman
</pre>

The install procedure will print out a warning:
<verbatim>
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</verbatim>

Before proceed with CA certificates installation you will have to install !Xrootd-GridFTP cache that contains libraries that are necessary for  !GridFTP to work directly with underlying !Xrootd DF.
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd-GridFTP
</pre>


Now you may proceed to CA certificates setup. Keep in  mind the information provided in the README is out of date. Please setup the CA certificates in the following way instead:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local -url osg
</pre>
This command will download certificates distributed by the OSG to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= and create a symlink from =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to that location. [[VDTCAManage][Other options]] are also available.

To reflect the changes update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. To see all services available use =vdt-control -list=
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
vdt-control --list
</pre>

This completes the installation of the !BeStMan server. Move to the next step to configure the !BeStMan, !XrootdFS and !GridFTP servers. You may also chose to configure Gratia transfer probe at this time.

---++ Service Configuration
The !BeStMan, !XrootdFS and !GridFTP servers and Gratia transfer probe are configured by the =configure-osg= script located in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/configure-osg= based on the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= configuration file.

The =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/= directory contains two template files =config.ini=. You will have to  edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file following instructions that precede each entry.  Here is the list of entries that need to be changed:

<pre class="screen">
[Bestman]
enabled = %(enable)s
user = daemon
mode = xrootd
transfer_servers = gsiftp://&lt;your  host fqn&gt;
certificate_file = /etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmancert.pem
key_file =  /etc/grid-security/bestman/bestmankey.pem
http_port = 10080
https_port = 10443
token_list = DATADISK[desc:SITEDATADISK][20] [usedBytesCommand:/usr/bin/du -s -b /data]
allowed_paths = /data

[Gridftp]
enabled = %(enable)s
mode = xrootd
redirector = &lt;xrootd_redirector_fqn&gt;
mount_point = &lt;virtual mount point&gt;
redirector_storage_path = &lt;storage area on redirector node&gt; 

[XrootdFS]
enabled = %(enable)s
user = daemon
redirector_host = &lt;xrootd_redirector_fqn&gt;
mount_point =  &lt;virtual mount point&gt;
redirector_storage_path = &lt;storage area on redirector node&gt; 

[Gratia]
enabled = %(enable)s
sitename = &lt;your registered site name&gt;
probes = %(itb-gridftp-gratia)s
</pre>

You will need to define static space tokens (token-list) ONLY if you want to use pre-defined, static space tokens. In this case, you need to provide a list of space token name, description and size of space allocated for each token. You may also provide the command  (followed usedBytesCommand) that will be run by !BeStMan-gateway to obtain used space info of the corresponding space token. Keep in mind that in gateway-mode, !BeStMan is not managing your space. 

The =Misc Services= section defines what method of authorization should be used. If your site uses a %RED%gridmap-file%ENDCOLOR% for authorization, please make following changes:
<pre class="screen">
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
authorization_method = gridmap
</pre>

In case your site supports %RED%GUMS%ENDCOLOR%, the fully qualified domain name of the GUMS server must be specified:

<pre class="screen">
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
gums_host = &lt;your gums server fqn&gt;
authorization_method = prima
</pre>

You can verify that your configuration is valid by executing =configure-osg -v=. Finally execute =configure-osg -c= to configure the !BeStMan installation.
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>

Hopefully all steps completed successfully and =vdt-control -list= shows the list of available services:
<pre class="screen">
#vdt-control --list
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
xrootdfs                | init   | enable
fetch-crl               | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs         | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs        | cron   | enable
gsiftp                  | inetd  | enable
gratia-gridftp-transfer | cron   | enable
gums-host-cron          | cron   | enable
edg-mkgridmap           | cron   | do not enable
bestman                 | init   | enable

</pre>

Now, you should make modification in =/etc/sudoers= file namely add the following lines to this file: 
<pre class="screen">
# Comment out this line, if it is in your /etc/sudoers file (RHEL5+)
#Defaults    requiretty

Cmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/ls, /bin/cp 
Runas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root 
<user_name> ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD 
</pre>
Please keep in mind that this is just an example, you can choose more  be more restrictive policy for your site.
!BeStMan server will not be able to run if this step is missed.


To configure the port range used by the server to transfer files, add following lines to =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh=:

<pre class="screen">
  export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=32000,64000
  export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=32000,64000
</pre>

and also to =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.csh=:

<pre class="screen">
  setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE 32000,64000
  setenv GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE 32000,64000
</pre>

 If you want to use the grid-map-file for user authentication and authorization ignore the rest of this section. Copy two files from $VDT_LOCATION/post-install to in /etc/grid-security:
<pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>
---++ Service Startup/Shutdown
To start type:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>
and to stop:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation

To check if !BeStMan is installed and operational you need to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SiteCoordination/GridClientTutorial][install client software]], obtain voms proxy certificate and then run the srm-ping to verify the !BeStMan server is up and running:
<pre class="screen">
srm-ping  srm://<your bestman host fqn>:10443/srm/v2/server
</pre>
 
To verify that you can transfer files do srm-copy:

<pre class="screen">
