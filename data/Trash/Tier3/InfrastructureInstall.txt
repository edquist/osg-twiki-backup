---++ Introduction
This is a placeholder for future documentation - it is not a complete document.

Here there are examples of installation of infrastructure services, e.g. VOMS.

---+++!! Applicable Versions
The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
Engineering consideration about these servers are on the ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome
This section concerns mainly test installations.

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].
%BR%
If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following the suggestions in ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure.

<!-- 
---++ Checklist
An in-line numbered list of items assumed to have been already performed
E.g.:
   1. Installs that must be done before this one
   1. Security environment in place
   1. batch system in place
   1. stop existing service
   1. ports required

---++ First Time Install
A link to document containing information and install steps that only need to be performed if this a first time install.

---++ Installation Procedure
There is a first section with steps that must be performed on each node, followed by sections specific to each node:
   * VOMS

---+++ Basic node setup
This part is common to each node.

You start with installing the OS, Scientific Linux 5.4. Some suggestion are provided in  ClusterOSInstall. In our installation we used a standard SL 5.4, using the DVD images available for download. This meant that no cluster management system or kickstart file were used, so all the manual configurations in the documents linked in this section have been tested.

The next step is the network configuration. For this example we choose a static network configuration and some suggestion are provided in ClusterNetworkSetup.

The configuration of ssh (to allow easy login to the nodes) is described in ClusterSSHSetup.

You may need additional configuration to integrate these nodes with an existing infrastructure, e.g. mount a shared file system, use a common account management, ...

Basic accounts setup is described in ClusterAccountsSetup.

The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

---+++ VOMS install

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using 
<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Description of the steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
This often requires, the reader to edit lines in a config file.
If this is necessary, put the lines in a screen box with a yellow background 
(to distinguish from entering commands (green box).
<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation
Commands to be used to verify the service is working correctly.  This can be combined with the previous section if they are both short.

#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Information
---+++!!File Locations
Locations of configuration files, input/output files, log files, etc. that are important for an administrator to know about if something doesn't work.  

---+++!!Debugging Procedure
What are the first things to check, step-by-step instructions to determine source of problem for this service

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues 

---+++!!References
References to additional information.  This document should be as concise as possible, but the reader can use these links if he/she wants more background or information.
