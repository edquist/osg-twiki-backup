<!-- [NO NFS] green tags
-->
---++ Rationale
The directory structure has been organized to facilitate software update and to maintain the same paths whether NFS is used or not.

The =/export= tree must contain all the NFS exported directories, local, or mounted (regular or bind), because of constraints of NFSv4.
