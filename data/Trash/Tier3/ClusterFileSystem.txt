---++ Directory structure
Here is the structure of some directories more in detail:<pre>
/exports 
/exports/certificates
/exports/condor
/exports/condor/condor-etc
/exports/condor/condor-7.4
/exports/condor/condor
/exports/home
/exports/osg
/exports/
/nfs/ 
/nfs/condor/
/nfs/condor/condor-etc
/nfs/condor/condor-7.4
/nfs/condor/condor
/nfs/home
/nfs/osg
/nfs/osg/app
/nfs/osg/app/pacman-3.29
/nfs/osg/app/pacman
/nfs/osg/data
/home 
/opt/condor 
/opt/condor-7.4         # if no NFS
/opt/pacman
/opt/pacman-3.29     # if no NFS
/storage 
/storage/xrootd 
/scratch 
/scratch/condor 
</pre>

<!-- [NO NFS] green tags
-->
---++ Rationale
The directory structure has been organized to facilitate software update and to maintain some paths also if there is no NFS.

The =/export= tree must contain all the NFS exported directories, local, or mounted (regular or bind), because of constraints of NFSv4.
