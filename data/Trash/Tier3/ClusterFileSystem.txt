/opt/condor-7.4   # if no NFS
/opt/pacman       # linked to /nfs/app/pacman if NFS is used, else linked to /opt/pacman-X.Y
/opt/pacman-3.29  # if no NFS
/osg              # linked to /nfs/osg if NFS is used (in any case with same structure)
/storage

</pre>

<!-- [NO NFS] green tags
-->
---++ Rationale
The directory structure has been organized to facilitate software update and to maintain the same paths whether NFS is used or not.

The =/export= tree must contain all the NFS exported directories, local, or mounted (regular or bind), because of constraints of NFSv4.
