Once your site is ready with all the desired services you should register it in OIM to add the site, resource, officially in OSG. The OIM registration is important because:
   1 provides OSG a way to contact site personnel (tickets, security notices)
   1 adds the site and the site administrators in the "OSG database"
   1 adds the resources in the information system, BDII, and in the MyOSG monitoring.
Follow the RegistrationInstructions? to register your resource.



go to facilities

add the facility

go to sites

add a new administrative site

ATLAS should register an ATLAS Tier 3 support center:
- for metrics 
- to allow future different routing
-> check with soichi if both RT + mailing list are possible

A support center can be a person that receives email. 

CSC copies the admin and goes to GOC, originally was the OSG general mailing list.
Community Support Center

MyOSG -> query, search for information

add resource group
WLCG - Resource Group name is what is showing in WLCG
