---+!! Tier 3 Documentation WIP 
%TOC% 

---++ Dev notes
*ToDo* part and *Links* are only for the Dev version

---+++ Site planning
*ToDo:* Prepare a shorter version of the Site Planning, as first instance rely on the one from OSG Release documentation.

The [[ReleaseDocumentation.SitePlanning][OSG SitePlanning]] document helps understanding OSG components and presents information on possible configurations.  

---+++ Cluster description
The hosts are organized in a cluster: structure with machines with different functions and a network infrastructure.

We suppose that all machine are networked together:
   * the intranet is the network connecting all the hosts
   * the extranet, outside network, is the network where user hosts and clients accessing the cluster reside, this can be the public internet or a private network
   * at least some machines, headnodes, are directly visible from the outside network
   * intranet and outside network may be the same (no need to have two networks)

The hosts have different functions:
   * head node - node with services accessible from the outside netwok
   * worker nodes - series of machines on the intranet, all identical (except the name), used to run jobs
   * servers - servers with specific functions useful for the cluster
Distinct functions may be on the same host.

A Local Resource Manager allows to contact a head node to schedule jobs on the worker nodes.

A shared file system is a disk space shared among the hosts of the cluster, e.g. NFS, xrootd.

Clusters come in different sizes. We'll refer to a small cluster for a cluster with less than 50 job slots.

Clusters can provide to the Grid and/or access several OSG services:
   * Compute element (CE)
   * Storage element (SE)
      * Classic SE - gsiftp
      * SRM
   * GUMS

---+++ Getting started
Hosts setup

---++++ Base systems
Hosts are supposed to have an operating system.
The reference OS used in this document is Scientific Linux 5.4, a linux distribution based on RHEL 5.4.
Anyway these instructions and examples should work for any RHEL based OS (e.g. RHEL, SL variants, !CentOS, ...) with little or no variation.
The OS installation is not covered by this document. ClusterOSInstall contains pointers to some documentation for your convenience.

---++To: ClusterOSInstall
Here there are links to documents about OS Installation.

[[https://www.scientificlinux.org/news/sl54][Here]] you can find more information about SL and [[https://www.scientificlinux.org/download][download]] the distribution.

There are several methods to install the OS:
   * Starting from installation media
   * Using a kickstart file
   * Using a cluster management system
   * ...

Here are some contributed examples:
   * By the US-ATLAS Tier 3 effort:

---++++ Customization of the base system
To ease the following installation steps and to have a common base here are established some conventions and customizations of the base OS, like user accounts, a shared file system and others.

File system structure:
   * =/exports= - root of the NFSv4 pseudo filesystem (directory tree exported by NFS)
   * =/nfs= - collects the directories mounted from NFS
   * =/home= - home directories (shared)
   * =/opt= - grid software
   * =/scratch= - local scratch area
   * =/storage= - data disk used for distributed file system (xrootd)

More in detail the structure is:<pre>
/exports 
/exports/certificates
/exports/condor
/exports/condor/condor-etc
/exports/condor/condor-7.4
/exports/condor/condor
/exports/home
/exports/osg
/exports/
/nfs/ 
/nfs/condor/
/nfs/condor/condor-etc
/nfs/condor/condor-7.4
/nfs/condor/condor
/nfs/home
/nfs/osg
/nfs/osg/app
/nfs/osg/app/pacman-3.29
/nfs/osg/app/pacman
/nfs/osg/data
/home 
/opt/condor 
/opt/condor-7.4         # if no NFS
/opt/pacman
/opt/pacman-3.29     # if no NFS
/storage 
/storage/xrootd 
/scratch 
/scratch/condor 
</pre>

[NO NFS] green tags

A first option, suitable for small Tier 3s makes use of shared directories to ease administration. ClusterNFSSetup describes how to setup the server and the clients for NFSv4

A second option performs the installation without the use of shared disk space.
If you decide not to have any NFS file system you will be limited in the possible options (e.g. no shared Condor installation) and some of the administrative tasks will be more difficult.

---+++ Cluster management system
*ToDo* add cluster management system. Later, not now

Alternatives:
   * rocks
   * puppet

---+++ Distributed file system 
xrootd is a shared file system distributed across several hosts, each one serving part of it. It is optimized to store data files, not for programs or system files.
It is used at its best if the jobs are running on the host serving their input files.

You may want to install xrootd if you have big data files and would like an uniform file system space using the disk space available on several nodes (dedicated data servers or the worker nodes).

XrootdInstall describes the installation of the xrootd file system

*ToDo* fix name spelling: find and coreect it everywhere
Should it be installed in /opt/osg or in /opt/xrootd? 
If multiple services are installed on the same host (CE, SE, xrootd, ...) should they share the same installation diretory or have different ones?

---+++ Quick Guide for setting up a Condor Cluster

The base configuration of condor can be modified to add some extra features:
   * CondorServiceJobSlotSetup describe how to add a service jobs slot to each node. This will allow to install application software or to run monitoring jobs on the worker nodes without modify the scheduling of the regular jobs
   * CondorHawkeyeSetup describes how to setup Condor's Hawkeye and shows an example using Hawkeye to conditionally schedule  or suspend jobs depending on the activity on the worker node

*ToDo* add Quill part and file staging part
   * CondorQuillSetup describes how to install and use Quill, a database storing information about the jobs scheduled using Condor 
Interesting notes about file staging

---+++ Cluster monitoring
*ToDo* add part about monitoring, specially Ganglia

Ganglia -notes. In theory distributed as RPM. The x86_64 is dated 4/2006 (Orville), the most recent RPM is 9/2008 (Wien)

*Links*:
   * http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/

---+++ User client
The user client machine is a host that allows users to login and provides them with software to access Grid services and specific VO software. This document covers only the installation of Grid clients, leaving to the VOs the documentation of their software.

SiteCoordination.GridClientTutorial shows the installation of the Grid client software.
Note that users will need to [[Education/SummerGridWorkshop.GridCertificateRequestTutorial][request a certificate]] and [[ReleaseDocumentation.RequestVOMembershipTutorial][register in a VO]] before being able to use the Grid.

Examples from VOs:
   * ATLAS VO: https://atlaswww.hep.anl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Tier3Setup/SoftwareInstallation
 
Links:
   * SiteCoordination.GridClientTutorial
   * Education/SummerGridWorkshop.GridCertificateRequestTutorial
   * ReleaseDocumentation.RequestVOMembershipTutorial
   * https://atlaswww.hep.anl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Tier3Setup/SoftwareInstallation

---+++ Worker node client
The worker node client is used to allow non interactive jobs (the ones submitted using the Grid or Condor) to access the Grid.
We are installing the worker node client in =/opt/wn=, linked to =/nfs/osg/wn= using the instruction in the OSG release documents: ReleaseDocumentation.WorkerNodeClient

In short, on the node chosen for the installation, e.g. =gc1-ce=:<pre>
source /nfs/osg/app/pacman/setup.sh
mkdir /nfs/osg/wn
ln -s /nfs/osg/wn /opt/osg
cd /opt/wn
pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:wn-client
ln -s /etc/grid-security/certificates /opt/wn/globus/TRUSTED_CA
</pre>

On all other nodes that may run jobs, e.g. the worker nodes:<pre>
ln -s /nfs/osg/wn /opt/osg
</pre>

Alternatively, if there is no shared file system or if there is a load concern, the worker node client can be installed locally, in =/opt/wn= on all the worker nodes.

---+++ Grid users authentication
There are 3 options:
   * use a gridmap file
   * rely on an external GUMS server
   * install a GUMS server

---+ Doc reprise
The documentation includes:
   * a description of the Tier 3 cluster and its main components
   * modular description of components that can be installed separately 
   * the installation of the nodes 
Components are hardware and software that provide a functionality, e.g. the queue manager, a Compute Element, Xrootd, ...
Nodes are computers belonging to the cluster.
Components can be placed on same or different nodes, depending on the number of nodes that are available.

---++Description

This document was designed as a hands-on guide to enable US ATLAS and US CMS Tier-3 system administrators to deploy a "new" cluster. The basic cluster installation creates a baseline infrastructure that experiment specific application components can be layered on top of to complete the intended functionality of the Tier-3 system. Experiment specific software (e.g. Phedex, DQ2, CRAB, Athena, ...) use and installation is NOT covered in this documentation and the interested reader may wish to consult [[https://atlaswww.hep.anl.gov/twiki/bin/view/UsAtlasTier3/WebHome][ATLAS T3]] and CMS websites for this information.

While this document is focused on the needs of US ATLAS and US CMS, other small sites may find this this documentation useful as well.

Users of this document are expected to have a basic understanding of Linux system administration but do not need to be familiar with cluster/grid systems; there are many explanations throughout this guide to assist the first time cluster installer. As such, this document also serves as an introductory entry point into the larger set of OSG documentation.

The documents below are in a hands-on format and present tested examples. Reference documents are cited to provide further background into each of the components as well as to allow admins to customize their configurations. 

If you want a hands-on example or are impatient go to the [[ExamplesIntro][Tier 3 Examples]] and follow the one closer to your needs.

If you prefer a custom configuration and you know what you want, then the instructions to install or configure specific modules (e.g. Condor, or Xrootd, or the network, or a Compute Element, ...) are in ModulesIntro, organized in 3 parts: 
   1. Hardware, OS setup, and networking
   1. Quick guide for setting up a Condor cluster
   1. User Interface, Compute Element (CE), Storage Element (SE)

Recommendations and concepts to get familiar with the Grid or the names and convention used in all the documents are presented in ConceptsIntro.

WebBook presents all the material in an didactic way: a presentation of the concepts, instruction to install and configure the different components of a Tier 3, examples of the installation of a Tier 3.
