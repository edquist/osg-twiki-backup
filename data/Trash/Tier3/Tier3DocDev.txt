---+!! Tier 3 Documentation WIP 
%TOC% 

---++ Dev notes
*ToDo* part and *Links* are only for the Dev version

---++ Getting started
These documents are aimed to help to setup a Tier 3 cluster.

---+++ Site planning
*ToDo:* Prepare a shorter version of the Site Planning, as first instance rely on the one from OSG Release documentation.

The [[ReleaseDocumentation.SitePlanning][OSG SitePlanning]] document helps understanding OSG components and presents information on possible configurations.  

---++++ Base systems
Hosts are supposed to have an operating system.
The reference OS used in this document is Scientific Linux 5.4, a linux distribution based on RHEL 5.4.
Anyway these instructions and examples should work for any RHEL based OS (e.g. RHEL, SL variants, !CentOS, ...) with little or no variation.
The OS installation is not covered by this document. Follow pointers to some documentation for your convenience.

---++To: ClusterOSInstall
Here there are links to documents about OS Installation.

[[https://www.scientificlinux.org/news/sl54][Here]] you can find more information about SL and [[https://www.scientificlinux.org/download][download]] the distribution.

There are several methods to install the OS:
   * Starting from installation media
   * Using a kickstart file
   * Using a cluster management system
   * ...

Here are some contributed examples:
   * By the US-ATLAS Tier 3 effort:

---+++ Cluster description
The hosts are organized in a cluster: structure with machines with different functions and a network infrastructure.

We suppose that all machine are networked together:
   * the intranet is the network connecting all the hosts
   * the outside network is the network where user hosts and clients accessing the cluster reside, this can be the public internet or a private network
   * at least some machines, headnodes, are directly visible from the outside network
   * intranet and outside network may be the same (no need to have two networks)

The hosts have different functions:
   * head node - node with services accessible from the outside netwok
   * worker nodes - series of machines on the intranet, all identical (except the name), used to run jobs
   * servers - servers with specific functions useful for the cluster
Distinct functions may be on the same host.

A Local Resource Manager allows to contact a head node to schedule jobs on the worker nodes.

A shared file system is a disk space shared among the hosts of the cluster, e.g. NFS, xrootd.

Clusters come in different sizes. We'll refer to a small cluster for a cluster with less than 50 job slots.

Clusters can provide to the Grid and/or access several OSG services:
   * Compute element (CE)
   * Storage element (SE)
      * Classic SE - gsiftp
      * SRM
   * GUMS

---++++ Customization of the base system
To ease the following installation steps and to have a common base here are established some conventions and customizations of the base OS, like user accounts, a shared file system and others.

File system structure:
<pre>
/exports - root of the NFSv4 pseudo filesystem
/nfs/ - collects the directories shared using NFS
/home - home directories (shared)
</pre>

A first option, suitable for small Tier 3s makes use of shared directories to ease administration.
ClusterSetupNFS describes how to setup the server and the clients for NFSv4

---+++ Cluster management system
*ToDo* add cluster management system. Later, not now

Alternatives:
   * rocks
   * puppet

---+++ Distributed file system 
xrootd is a shared file system distributed across several hosts, each one serving part of it. It is optimized to store data files, not for programs or system files.
It is used at its best if the jobs are running on the host serving their input files.

You may want to install xrootd if you have big data files and would like an uniform file system space using the disk space available on several nodes (dedicated data servers or the worker nodes).

XrootdInstall describes the installation of the xrootd file system

---+++ Quick Guide for setting up a Condor Cluster
Condor 
Each cluster needs a Local Resource Manager (LRM, also called _queue manager_ or _scheduler_) to schedule the jobs on the worker nodes. Common LRMs are Condor, LSF, PBS, SGE, if you have one installed or a preferred one you can use that one. 
If not CondorInstall describes how to install and configure Condor 7.4, the latest production version of Condor.
Here presented are two alternatives to install Condor:
   * CondorSharedInstall - is an easy way to add Condor to small clusters using a shared file system 
      * it is easy to add new nodes
      * configuration changes and updates are also very quick
      * cons: shared installation may slow down several nodes using it
   * CondorRPMInstall - Condor is installed on each node using the RPM packages of Condor
      * no contention for shared files
      * only option if no shared file system
      * cons: some more work to add nodes 
      * cons: updates need to be installed on all nodes 

The base configuration of condor can be modified to add some extra features:
   * CondorServiceJobSlotSetup describe how to add a service jobs slot to each node. This will allow to install application software or to run monitoring jobs on the worker nodes without modify the scheduling of the regular jobs
   * CondorHawkeyeSetup describes how to setup Condor's Hawkeye and shows an example using Hawkeye to conditionally schedule  or suspend jobs depending on the activity on the worker node

*ToDo* add Quill part and file staging part
   * CondorQuillSetup describes how to install and use Quill, a database storing information about the jobs scheduled using Condor 
Interesting notes about file staging
