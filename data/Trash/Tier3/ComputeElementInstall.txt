---++Introduction
This is a tutorial to demonstrate how to install and setup a basic CE installation.  It will guide users through a basic CE installation step by step.  At the completion of this guide, you should have a simple CE available.

These instructions assume that the Compute Element software is being installed on system following the guidelines for OSG Tier 3s. 
These include a RHEL based OS and a Condor resource manager, installed as described in ModulesIntro. Other recommandations are at the beginning of [[ModulesIntro][that]] document. As usual different configuration will likely work but you may have to change/adapt the instructions.

A more complete set of instructions is in [[ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementInstall][ComputeElementInstall from the release documentation]].

---+++ Requirements
You'll need a server with the following:
   * RHEL 4 or 5 based Linux distribution (reference OS is Scientific Linux 5.4)
   * root access
   * ~5 GB of free space
   * Condor installed using the [[CondorRPMInstall][RPM distribution]] or the [[CondorSharedInstall][shared tar installation]]
   * internet access (at least outbound connectivity)
   * Host, http, and rsv certificates (you can copy the host certificate and use it for the http and rsv services)

To perform the tests you'll also need the following:
   * Personal grid certificate

---++ Getting started
---+++ Installing pacman
Pacman is a package management program used to install OSG software.   ReleaseDocumentation.PacmanInstall describes how to install Pacman which can be installed by either the cluster administrator or a non-privileged account.  For example the cluster administrator might install this in =/osg/app/pacman= or =/opt/pacman= such as in the following
%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Pacman installation example."
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="screen">
cd /opt
wget http://atlas.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.29.tar.gz
tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.29.tar.gz
cd pacman-3.29
source setup.sh
cd ..
ln -s pacman-3.29 pacman
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY% Once installed setup its environment with for example =source /opt/pacman/setup.sh=.  

---+++ Creating directories
Create the installation directory and =/etc/grid security= : <pre class="screen">
mkdir /etc/grid-security
mkdir /etc/grid-security/http
</pre>

Next, the host and service certificates will need to be placed in the proper places in =/etc/grid-security=.  These instructions assume that the following files are in the current directory. ReleaseDocumentation.GetHostServiceCertificates provides instruction on how to obtain host and service certificates/keys. If you have the host certificate/key but no service certificates/keys and are unable to obtain them, a copy of the host certificate will work as temporary solution.
   * =hostcert.pem= - host certificate file
   * =hostkey.pem= - host key file
   * =httpcert.pem= - http service certificate file
   * =httpkey.pem= - http service key file
   * =rsvcert.pem= - RSV service certificate file
   * =rsvkey.pem= - RSV service key file

Copy the host, RSV and http certificates and keys to =/etc/grid-security= or the correct subdirectory: <pre class="screen">
cp hostcert.pem hostkey.pem /etc/grid-security/
cp rsvcert.pem rsvkey.pem /etc/grid-security/
cp httpcert.pem httpkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http   
</pre>
Make sure that the owner is root:<pre class="screen">
chown root:root /etc/grid-security/host*
chown rsvuser:rsvuser /etc/grid-security/rsv*
chown root:root /etc/grid-security/http/http*
</pre>
Set the correct permissions for the certificate and key files:<pre class="screen">
chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/rsvkey.pem
chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/rsvcert.pem
chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem
chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem=
</pre>
   
Now create the OSG service directories with the correct permissions: OSG_APP, OSG_DATA, OSG_GRID. More information on all the possible service directories and on recommended configurations for OSG sites is in  ReleaseDocumentation.LocalStorageConfiguration. We assume a shared file system is used with the structure described in ClusterNFSSetup. <pre class="screen">
ln -s /nfs/osg /osg  # if you did not already
mkdir -p /osg/app
mkdir -p /osg/app/etc
chmod 1777 /osg/app
chmod 1777 /osg/app/etc
mkdir -p /osg/data
chmod 1777 /osg/data
mkdir -p /osg/wn
</pre>

---+++ RSV preparations
If you are running RSV using a service certificate, add the service certificate to your =grid-mapfile= and map it to the RSV user (=rsvuser=).

<!--
%RED%Service certificate, GUMS entries%ENDCOLOR% 
%BR%
RSV will need an user  account to run it's probes and a proxy.  We will use proxy generated using your user certificate (you will need to recreate and refresh it once a week).
    * =useradd rsvuser= to create an account called rsvuser for rsv to use
To generate the proxy, do the following:
    * run =grid-proxy-init -valid 168:0= on a system which has your grid certificate and the osg client tools in your path
    * run =grid-proxy-info= and then note the file given in the line starting with path (e.g. = path     : /tmp/x509up_u20016= )
    * copy this file to =/tmp/rsv_proxy= on the machine where you are installing your CE (e.g. =scp /tmp/x509up_u20016 root@host:/tmp/rsv_proxy=)
    * run =chown rsvuser:rsvuser /tmp/rsv_proxy= 
-->

---+++ Install worker node software
If not already installed, install the OSG Worker Node software stack as in the [[ModulesIntro#Worker_node_client][Worker Node section of ModulesIntro]].  

---++ Install and configure the CE
Create an install directory and install the Compute Element: <pre class="screen">
mkdir /opt/osgce
cd /opt/osgce
pacman -allow trust-all-caches -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:ce
</pre>
Set the following variables to point to your Condor installation so that it is used by the CE. If you have a local resource manager different from Condor (e.g. PBS or LSF) check the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementInstall#Install_job_managers][job manager section in the Release CE Install document]] instead.
If you used the [[CondorRPMInstall][RPM distribution]] then set:<pre class="screen">
export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=/usr
export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG=/etc/condor/condor_config
</pre> else if you did the [[CondorSharedInstall][shared tar installation]] set: <pre class="screen">
export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=/opt/condor
export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG=/opt/condor/etc/condor_config
</pre>
Now install the Condor jobmanager setup package: <pre class="screen">
pacman -allow trust-all-caches -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:Globus-Condor-Setup
</pre>
Install managed fork: <pre class="screen">
pacman -allow trust-all-caches -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:ManagedFork
</pre>
<!-- Managed fork will install its own Condor if no Condor is provided using VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION, .... If Condor is found, it will be used to schedule local executions on the gatekeeper host 
-->

---+++ Configure CE
Run the post-install script: <pre class="screen">
source /opt/osgce/setup.sh 
vdt-post-install 
</pre>
Setup CA certificates: <pre class="screen">
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local --url osg
</pre>
In ReleaseDocumentation.CaCertificatesInstall and in [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html][this VDT page]] you can find information on different options for the installation and configuration of the CA certificates using ==vdt-ca-manage==.

Edit =osg/etc/config.ini= changing the following entries (use also the comments in the file as guidelines/explanation):
   * In the =[Default]= section:
      * Set =localhost= to the correct FQDN (Fully qualified Domain Name) for your CE (e.g. localhost = gc1-ce.yourdomain.org)

Verify configuration with =configure-osg -v=, fix eventual error or missing entries, then configure the system: <pre class="screen">
configure-osg -c
</pre>

For more option on the CE configuration check the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementInstall#Configuration][Configuration section of the CE Install document in the release documentation]].
<!--
   * Add your grid certificate DN to =/etc/grid-security/gridmap= if it's not there. E.g.
<pre class="screen">
[root@uct3-edge5 var]# echo "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Suchandra Thapa 757586" sthapa > /etc/grid-security/gridmap
</pre>
-->

----++ Start/stop the CE
To start the CE (ten will remain on also after a reboot): <pre class="screen">
source /opt/osgce/setup.sh
vdt-control --on
</pre>

To stop a CE: <pre class="screen">
source /opt/osgce/setup.sh
vdt-control --off
</pre>

----++ Verification
   * Run site_verify. You can add your host certificate to =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= to be able to run as root. Even better, if you have a user owning a certificate already in your grid-mapfile or GUMS, log in as that user and, after sourcing the setup file, initialize the proxy with =grid-proxy-init=. Then continue with running  ==$VDT_LOCATION/verify/site_verify.pl==.
