---++ Introduction
Xrootd is a high performance network storage system widely used in high energy physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. The underlying Xroot data transfer protocol provides highly efficient access to ROOT based data files.  

This page provides instructions for using a Xrootd storage system consisting of one redirector node and one or more data server nodes.  

For the installation instructions check instead XrootdInstall.

---++ Getting Started
As a user you have three different ways to interact with Xrootd: a file system mounted with !XrootdFS, the application =xrdcp=, LD_PRELOAD.

To use a Xrootd file system mounted with !XrootdFS you don't need any special setup. It should be completely transparent to you.

To use =xrdcp= you need to have it in your path (e.g. =source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh=, where =$INSTALL_DIR= is the Xrootd installation directory)

The use of LD_PRELOAD is not recommended if you have any alternative available. Anyway you will have to add the Xrootd libraries to your library path and add the POSIX preload library to your environment, e.g. <pre class="screen">source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh
export LD_PRELOAD=$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib/libXrdPosixPreload.so 
</pre>

---++ Testing and Using the System 

---+++ Simple copy tests
Login on the redirector node (e.g. =redirector.yourdomain.org=) and:
<pre class="screen">source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh 
echo &ldquo;This is a test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
xrdcp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/test 
xrdcp xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/test /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
</pre>
Users can write in their own space. E.g. a user with Unix account name  =myuser= (the account must exist, eg. in =/etc/passwd=, etc,  on the redirector and on all the data servers) could save a file in Xrootd: <pre class="screen">source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh 
echo &ldquo;This is a user test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
xrdcp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/myuser/test 
</pre>
Note that =xrdcp= creates missing directories.

---+++ Tests using the !libXrdPosixPreload library
Using Xrootd with the POSIX preload library
<pre class="screen">source $INSTALL_DIR/setup.sh
export LD_PRELOAD=$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib/libXrdPosixPreload.so 
echo &ldquo;This is a new test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
mkdir xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir
cp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir/test 
cp xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir/test /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
rm xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir/test 
rmdir xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094//storage/path/subdir
</pre>

---+++ Tests using !XrootdFS
The directory mounted using !XrootdFS can be used as any other directory mounted on your file system.
All the normal Unix commands should work. You don't need any special setup or library.
Try using =cp=, =rm=, =mv=, =mkdir=, =rmdir=.
<pre class="screen">
echo &ldquo;This is a new test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
mkdir -p /xrootd/subdir/sub2
cp /tmp/test /xrootd/subdir/sub2/test 
cp /xrootd/subdir/sub2/test /xrootd/subdir/sub2/test1 
cp /xrootd/subdir/sub2/test1 /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
rm -r /xrootd/subdir
</pre>
