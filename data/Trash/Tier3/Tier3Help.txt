The first line of support for Tier-3 sites is primarily provided by [[ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure#VO_Assistance][the VO]] and/or local computing support personnel. 

In addition, OSG provides support via multiple channels including:
   * the [[ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure#Emergency_Assistance][24x7 GOC Emergency assistance]] for urgent matters
   * the [[Trash/Trash/SiteCoordination.ChatCalendar][Campfire Web chat]] for direct interactive support 
   * the [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open][GOC ticketing system]] to better track the case
   * its [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Consortium_Mailing_Lists][mailing lists]] for community support

Check Documentation/Release3.HelpProcedure for a complete list of what is available, which channel is recommended for specific issues and  and where/how you can get help during the installation or maintenance of Tier 3s.

<!--
---++ Support policy
Different form of support within OSG are available for Tier 3 system administrators or users.

---+++ Full support
OSG provides support directly or through VDT for all the software available through the OSG cache.
This includes:
   * grid components like the CE, SE, ...
   * distributed file systems like xrootd, dCache, ...
   * the Condor resource manager

Full support means that OSG will provide a clear documentation to install and use the software, if will take responsibly to fix bugs either directly or following up with the software providers.

Furthermore OSG will take care to fix and update all its documents like the one in the Twiki and the documentation repository.

Possible support channels are:
   * GOC Tickets open via Web, email or phone
   * OSG Campfire chat room
   * Mailing lists

---+++ Best effort support
Some of the software described in some documents, specially in the Tier 3 twiki, id not part of OSG or VDT. 
The main source of support here will be the software provider.

Anyway OSG will provide support, specially with the OSG Campfire chat room and the mailing lists that can be used by the OSG community to share experiences and support.
