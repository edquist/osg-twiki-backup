---++ Document Purpose and Overview

This document was designed as a hands-on guide to enable US ATLAS and US CMS Tier-3 system administrators to deploy a "new" cluster. The basic cluster installation creates a baseline infrastructure that experiment specific application components can be layered on top of to complete the intended functionality of the Tier-3 system. Experiment specific software (e.g. Phedex, DQ2, CRAB, Athena, ...) use and installation is NOT covered in this documentation and the interested reader may wish to consult [[https://atlaswww.hep.anl.gov/twiki/bin/view/UsAtlasTier3/WebHome][ATLAS T3]] and CMS websites for this information.

While this document is focused on the needs of US ATLAS and US CMS, other small sites may find this this documentation useful as well.

Users of this document are expected to have a basic understanding of Linux system administration but do not need to be familiar with cluster/grid systems; there are many explanations throughout this guide to assist the first time cluster installer. As such, this document also serves as an introductory entry point into the larger set of OSG documentation.

The documents below are in a hands-on format and present tested examples. Reference documents are cited to provide further background into each of the components as well as to allow admins to customize their configurations. 

If you want a hands-on example or are impatient to start go to the [[ExamplesIntro][Tier 3 Examples]] and follow the one closer to your needs.

If you prefer a custom configuration and you know what you want, then the instructions to install or configure specific modules (e.g. Condor, or Xrootd, or the network, or a Compute Element, ...) are in ModulesIntro, organized in 3 parts: 
   1. Hardware, OS setup, and networking
   1. Quick guide for setting up a Condor cluster
   1. User Interface, Compute Element (CE), Storage Element (SE)

Specially if you are new to Grid computing, recommendations and concepts to get familiar with the Grid or the names and convention used in all the documents are presented in ConceptsIntro.

WebBook presents all the material in an didactic way: a presentation of the concepts, instruction to install and configure the different components of a Tier 3, examples of the installation of a Tier 3.

---++ Help
The different form of support available for scientists and system administrators deploying Tier 3s are described in Tier3Help.
