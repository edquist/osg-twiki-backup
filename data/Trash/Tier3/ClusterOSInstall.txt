%TOC%

Here there are links to documents about OS Installation.

The reference OS used in this document is Scientific Linux 5.4, a linux distribution based on RHEL 5.4. Anyway these instructions and examples should work for any RHEL based OS (e.g. RHEL, SL variants, !CentOS, ...) with little or no variation. 

[[https://www.scientificlinux.org/news/sl54][Here]] you can find more information about Scientific Linux and [[https://www.scientificlinux.org/download][download]] the distribution.

There are several methods to install the OS:
   * Starting from installation media
   * Using a kickstart file
   * Using a cluster management system
   * ...

Here are some contributed examples:
