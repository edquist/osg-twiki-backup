---++ Introduction
Time synchronization is essential to Grid services and other secure services. Without a correct time and date you'll incur in authentication errors. NTP is a service that synchronizes hosts using the network. Probably the OS installation will take care of it. 

=ntpd= daemon can run on a host and take care of maintaining it synchronized.
If the time on your system is too far from the one of the synchronization server the daemon will fail: you must force a manual synchronization before starting the deamon.

---++ Manual synchronization 
To force a manual synchronization: <pre class="screen">ntpd -q
</pre>

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
ntpd configuration is in =/etc/ntpd.conf=. Make sure that some NTP servers are listed, e.g.:<pre class="file">
# Red Hat servers at ntp.org
server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
server 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org
server 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org
# generic pool
server pool.ntp.org
</pre>

To restart ntpd automatically after a reboot:<pre class="screen">chkconfig --level 35 ntpd on
</pre>

To start (stop) NTP daemon:<pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/ntpd start
/etc/init.d/ntpd stop</pre>
