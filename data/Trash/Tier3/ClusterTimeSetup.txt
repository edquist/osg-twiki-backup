---++ Introduction
Time synchronization is essential to Grid services and other secure services. Without a correct time and date you'll incur authentication errors. NTP is a service that synchronizes hosts using the network. It is a part of an OS install. 

=ntpd= is an operating system daemon that sets and maintains the system time of day in synchronization with Internet standard time servers.
*If the time on your system is too far (1000s on most Linux systems) from the one of the synchronization server the daemon will fail* : you must force a manual synchronization before starting the daemon.

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Make sure that some NTP servers are listed in the ntpd configuration ( =/etc/ntp.conf=). If your university or institute does not run their own, you can use for example:<pre class="file">
# Red Hat servers at ntp.org
server 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
server 1.rhel.pool.ntp.org
server 2.rhel.pool.ntp.org
# generic pool
server pool.ntp.org
</pre>

To restart ntpd automatically after a reboot:<pre class="rootscreen">chkconfig --level 35 ntpd on
</pre>

To start (stop) NTP daemon:<pre class="rootscreen">/etc/init.d/ntpd start
/etc/init.d/ntpd stop</pre>

---++ Manual synchronization 
To force a manual synchronization you must have valid server listed in your =/etc/ntp.conf= file. First stop the ntpd daemon, then synchronize your system clock and after that restart the daemon: <pre class="rootscreen">
service ntpd stop
ntpd -q -g
service ntpd start
</pre>
The option =-g= forces the synchronization even if the local clock is very far from the one on the synchronization server.

On some servers you may still have =ntpdate=, being replaced by =ntpd -q=, that allows to specify the server on the command line: <pre class="screen">ntpdate -u 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
</pre>

---++ Validation 
To verify if your server is synchronized you can use:<pre class="screen">/usr/sbin/ntpdate -u -q 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
server 207.171.7.152, stratum 2, offset -0.000151, delay 0.08762
server 149.20.54.20, stratum 2, offset -0.002404, delay 0.08109
server 70.86.250.6, stratum 2, offset -0.001394, delay 0.06032
 7 May 16:43:04 ntpdate[29314]: adjust time server 70.86.250.6 offset -0.001394 sec
</pre> or <pre class="screen">ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset  jitter
==============================================================================
*tick.phyber.com .PPS.            1 u   78  128  275   62.024    0.700   0.487
+gnar.stonekitty 164.67.62.194    2 u  163  128  316   53.134    2.485   1.157
+www2.bitvector. 69.25.96.13      2 u   20  128  377   92.920   -5.267   1.092
 LOCAL(0)        .LOCL.          10 l   19   64  377    0.000    0.000   0.001
</pre>
Output of these commands  provides a list of configured time servers and the delay, offset and jitter between them and your server. In case of correct synchronization, the delay and offset values should be non-zero and the jitter value should be under 100.

To verify if ntpd is running use:<pre class="screen">service ntpd status
</pre>

Note that the host synchronization and status of the =ntpd=  are independent. Your server can be synchronized even if =ntpd= is not running (but without the daemon synchronization might be easily lost). On the other hand the server might be not synchronized even if =ntpd= is running.
