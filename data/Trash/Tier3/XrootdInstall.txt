---+!! *<nop>%SPACEOUT{ "Xrootd Installation" }%*
%TOC%

---++ Introduction
Xrootd is a high performance network storage system widely used in High Energy Physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. The underline Xroot data transfer protocol provides very high efficient access to the ROOT based data files. Xrootd also provides POSIX-like access to files and their enclosing directory namespace ( [[http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/papers/Scalla-Intro.htm Xrootd Home Page]] ).

---++++++!!Applicable Versions
This document applies to an install of 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.4* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---++++++!!Engineering Considerations
In order to have a working Xrootd installation you will need a least 2 nodes. One node will serve as a redirector node, the other nodes will play a role of data servers. One redirector node can support more then 200K data servers. 
Xrootd is using two storage areas. One storage area (referred in this document as a _storage_path_) could be accessed by clients using xroot protocol. This area contains symbolic links to the data files that are located in the cache storage area (here referred as _storage_cache_ ). It is recommended to use a separate partition for each storage area, but in principal for _storage_path_ a directory can be used as well. In Xrootd production instillation at SLAC an ext3 partition is used for _storage_path_. This storage area requires a significant amount of inodes. However, too many inodes means small block size. For real file, that means a limit of file size (though not clear about sym linked files, which are big in size but are filled with empty holes). At SLAC, the block size is set to 1k (thus put a limit of real file size at ~256GB).


---++Checklist
   1. [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is required
   1. If firewall is enabled iptables  must modified to allow incoming connections to the xrootd. See instruction how to configure firewall on [[#Firewall_iptables_configuration][redirector]] and [[#Firewall_iptables_configurat_AN1][data server nodes]].
   1.  All xrootd daemons should run under some user name (not root!), the user account should be created on all the nodes and it should have a login shell.

---++Installation Procedure
Login as root and set up  pacman, make sure that >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is installed:


<pre class="screen">
su root
. &lt;PACMAN_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
pacman -version
</pre>

Create a user (e.g _xrootd_).The user (this user SHOULD have a login shell) !!!!
<pre class="screen">
#/usr/sbin/groupadd xrootd 
#/usr/sbin/useradd --gid xrootd xrootd
</pre>

Decide what area you would use as a _storage_path_ and _storage_cache_ (e.g /storage/data and /storage/cache).

Next create and change to an installation directory. This directory will later be used to get the !GridFTP-Xrootd package  from the %CACHE% cache.
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/%OSG_VERSION%-xrootd/
cd /opt/osg%OSG_VERSION%-xrootd/
</pre>


You will need to install !Xrootd package from the %CACHE% cache. 
Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=) and whether you want to accept the license (=y=).

<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd
</pre>
 

Update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>


You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. T
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
</pre>

This completes the installation of the Xrootd. Move to the next step to configure  !Xrootd on redirector and data server nodes. 

---++ Service Configuration
---+++ Configuring Xrootd on Redirector Node
The  !Xrootd is configured by the =configure-osg= script located in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/configure-osg= based on the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= configuration file.

The =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/= directory contains two template files =config.ini=. You will have to  edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file following instructions that precede each entry.  Here is the list of entries that need to be changed:

<pre class="screen">
;===================================================================
;                       Xrootd
;===================================================================


[Xrootd]
enabled = %(enable)s
user = xrootd
mode = redirector
redirector_host = &lt;your_redirector_fqn&gt;
redirector_storage_path = /storage/data
redirector_storage_cache = /storage/cache
token_list = %(default)s
; This setting gives the size of the storage area allocated to public use in GB,
; i.e. not allocated to a space token
public_cache_size = 10
</pre>
You can verify that your configuration is valid by executing =configure-osg -v=. Finally execute =configure-osg -c= to configure the !BeStMan installation.
<pre class="screen">
cd osg1.2-xrootd
. setup.sh
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>


Hopefully all steps completed successfully and =vdt-control -list= shows the list of available services:
<pre class="screen">
#vdt-control --list
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
xrootd                  | init   | enable
</pre>

---+++ Configure Xrootd Data Server node (for slave nodes)

Once you installed Xrootd as described above, on the Data Server nodes (hosts providing the shared disk space) you have to do the following steps:
The  !Xrootd is configured by the =configure-osg= script located in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/configure-osg= based on the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= configuration file.

The =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/= directory contains two template files =config.ini=. You will have to  edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file following instructions that precede each entry.  Here is the list of entries that need to be changed:

<pre class="screen">
;===================================================================
;                       Xrootd
;===================================================================


[Xrootd]
enabled = %(enable)s
user = xrootd
mode = data
redirector_host = &lt;your_redirector_fqn&gt;
redirector_storage_path = /storage/data
redirector_storage_cache = /storage/cache
token_list = %(default)s
; This setting gives the size of the storage area allocated to public use in GB,
; i.e. not allocated to a space token
public_cache_size = 10
</pre>
You can verify that your configuration is valid by executing =configure-osg -v=. Finally execute =configure-osg -c= to configure the !BeStMan installation.
<pre class="screen">
cd osg1.2-xrootd
. setup.sh
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>


Hopefully all steps completed successfully and =vdt-control -list= shows the list of available services:
<pre class="screen">
#vdt-control --list
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
xrootd                  | init   | enable
</pre>
---++ Firewall configuration

---+++ Firewall (iptables) configuration for Xrootd Redirector node

Edit the =/etc/sysconfig/iptables= file to add these lines ahead of the reject line
<pre class="screen"># Xrootd connections  (from anywhere) 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1094 -j ACCEPT 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1213 -j ACCEPT 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2094 -j ACCEPT 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2525 -j ACCEPT 
# </pre>

Check the status of iptables<pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre> 
Restart iptables<pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/iptables restart</pre> 
Check the status of the iptables to see the changes<pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre>

---+++ Firewall (iptables) configuration for Xrootd Data Server node

Edit the =/etc/sysconfig/iptables= file to add these lines ahead of the reject line
<pre class="screen"># Xrootd connections  (from anywhere) 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2525 -j ACCEPT

Restart iptables<pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables restart </pre> 
Check the status of the iptables to see the changes<pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre>
Now edit the file =$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg=. Change "_xrd.port any_" to *xrd.port 2525*

---++ Start/Stop !Xrootd

You will need to login to node where  !Xrootd is installed  to start/stop xrtood:

To start:

<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/osg1.2-xrootd
. setup.sh
vdt-control -on
</pre>

To stop:

<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/osg1.2-xrootd
. setup.sh
vdt-control -on
</pre>


---++ Validation of Service Operation

 Login on redirector node as an ordinary user.

<pre class="screen">cd /opt/osg1.2-xrootd 
source setup.sh 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib 
export LD_PRELOAD=$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib/libXrdPosixPreload.so 
echo &ldquo;This is a test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
cp /tmp/test xroot://gc1-xrdr:1094///xrootd/data/test 
cp xroot://gc1-xrdr:1094///xrootd/data/test /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
</pre>

For example:
<pre class="screen">cp /tmp/test xroot://gc1-xrdr.yourdomain.org:1094//xrootd/data/test </pre>
