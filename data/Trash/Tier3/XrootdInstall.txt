---+!! *<nop> Xrootd Installation*
%TOC%

---++ Introduction
Xrootd is a high performance network storage system widely used in high energy physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. The underlying Xroot data transfer protocol provides highly efficient access to ROOT based data files.  This page provides instructions for creating a simple Xrootd storage system consisting of:
   * One redirector node
   * One or more data server node(s)


---++ Getting Started

---+++ Identify hosts and roles
   * Identify the redirector node
   * Identify the data server(s)

---+++ Check firewall rules
It is important to make sure your firewall (if any) isn't blocking the ports that Xrootd uses for communication.  Otherwise, it becomes difficult to diagnose errors and failures may occur.  Xrootd uses the following ports:

| *Host* | *Port Number* | *Protocol* |
|!Xrootd data server| random ports selected by the OS |tcp|
|!Xrootd redirector|1094|tcp|
||2094|tcp|
||1213|tcp|

Check the firewall rules with =/etc/init.d/iptables status=.   See below for more information on firewall configuration settings for Xrootd.

---+++ Create the xrootd user account
You need a non privileged Xrootd user account on the redirector and all data servers, and that user *must have a login shell*.    If you manage your accounts by hand (rather than using a service such as LDAP) you would, on your management node:
<pre class="screen">
/usr/sbin/groupadd xrootd 
/usr/sbin/useradd --gid xrootd xrootd
</pre>
and copy =/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group,= and =/etc/gshadow= to each of the xrootd nodes.

---+++ Install Pacman
Pacman is a package management program used to install OSG software.
ReleaseDocumentation.PacmanInstall describes how to install Pacman.
You may select  =/opt/pacman= as the installation directory.<br>
%TWISTY{
mode="div"
showlink="Show an example of how to install Pacman..."
hidelink="Hide"
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%"
hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"
}%
<pre class="screen">
cd /opt
wget http://atlas.bu.edu/~youssef/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.29.tar.gz
tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.29.tar.gz
cd pacman-3.29
source setup.sh
cd ..
ln -s pacman-3.29 pacman
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%
Once Pacman is installed do: =source /opt/pacman/setup.sh=.  You are ready to install Xrootd.

---++ Installing and configuring the redirector
Two areas need to be setup: _storage_path_ and _storage_cache_. You may use  separate disk partitions for these but for the redirector we recommend simply creating two directories:
   * /storage/cache is a service directory for the redirector. 
   * /storage/path is a directory containing internal Xrootd references to files in the system.  Xrootd clients access files using _storage_path_. 
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /storage/path
mkdir -p /storage/cache
</pre>

Next create and change to an installation directory. <pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/xrootd/
cd /opt/xrootd/
</pre>

Install the !Xrootd package from the %CACHE% cache.  Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (answer =yall=).
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd
</pre>

Update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by invoking =vdt-version= : <pre class="screen">
vdt-version
</pre>

This completes the installation part of the Xrootd redirector. The next step is to configure the Xrootd redirector.
   * $VDT_LOCATION is the installation directory of the Xrootd redirector (=/opt/xrootd=)
   * =xrootd= is the non-privileged user that runs the Xrootd redirector service 
   * =/storage/cache= and =/storage/path= are the directories discussed above
   * =--public-cache-size 1= is a configuration option necessary for historical reasons (it will be removed from future releases).

<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/xrootd
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_xrootd  --server y  --user xrootd  --this-is-xrdr --xrdr-storage-path /storage/path   --xrdr-storage-cache /storage/cache --public-cache-size 1
</pre>

Now =vdt-control -list= shows the Xrootd service is installed:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --list
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
xrootd                  | init   | enable
</pre>

Startup the redirector:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>

Here is an example of running Xrootd redirector services:
<pre  class="screen">
ps ax | grep xrootd
13479 pts/2    Sl     0:00 /opt/xrootd/xrootd/bin//xrootd -l /opt/xrootd/xrootd/var/logs/xrdlog -c /opt/xrootd/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg
13537 pts/2    Sl     0:00 /opt/xrootd/xrootd/bin//xrootd -n xrootd_cnd -l /opt/xrootd/xrootd/var/logs/xrdlog -c /opt/xrootd/xrootd/etc/xrootd_cnd.cfg
13601 pts/2    Sl     0:00 /opt/xrootd/xrootd/bin//cmsd -l /opt/xrootd/xrootd/var/logs/cmslog -c /opt/xrootd/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg
</pre>

---++ Installing and configuring the data server(s)
These instruction must be executed on each of the data servers.

Two areas need to be setup: _storage_path_ and _storage_cache_.  In the simplest case two directories will suffice,  e.g =/storage/path= and =/storage/cache=.  For larger data servers we recommend creating separate disk partitions (see below).  Note on Xrootd data servers: 
   * =/storage/path= is a directory containing symbolic links to files in _storage_cache_.  
   * =/storage/cache= contains actual data files

Next create and change to an installation directory:
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/xrootd/
cd /opt/xrootd/
</pre>

Install the !Xrootd package from the %CACHE% cache.  Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (answer =yall=).
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd
</pre>

Update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>

Verify the version installed is the one you expected by invoking =vdt-version= (=man vdt-version= to get more info). 
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
</pre>

This completes the installation of an Xrootd data server. The next step is to configure it.  The command below uses the defaults chosen in these instructions which you may need to change to match your specific choices:
   * $VDT_LOCATION is a directory of Xrootd installation (=/opt/xrootd=)
   * xrootd is the non-privileged user that runs the Xrootd data service 
   * FQDN of the redirector host, e.g.  =redirector.yourdomain.org= 
   * =/storage/cache= and =/storage/path= are the directories created above
   * =--public-cache-size 1= is an option needed for historical reasons. It will be removed from future versions.

<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/xrootd
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_xrootd  --server y  --user xrootd  --xrdr-host  redirector.yourdomain.org  --xrdr-storage-path /storage/path   --xrdr-storage-cache /storage/cache  --public-cache-size 1
</pre>

Now =vdt-control -list= shows the Xrootd service is installed:
<pre class="screen">
#vdt-control --list
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
xrootd                  | init   | enable
</pre>


Startup the data server:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>

Here is an example showing running Xrootd data services:
<pre  class="screen">
ps a | grep xrootd
16072 pts/1    Sl     0:00 /opt/xrootd/xrootd/bin//xrootd -l /opt/xrootd/xrootd/var/logs/xrdlog -c /opt/xrootd/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg
16091 pts/1    Sl     0:00 /opt/xrootd/xrootd/bin/XrdCnsd -d -l /opt/xrootd/xrootd/var/logs/cnsd.log root://itb2.uchicago.edu:2094
16144 pts/1    Sl     0:00 /opt/xrootd/xrootd/bin//cmsd -l /opt/xrootd/xrootd/var/logs/cmslog -c /opt/xrootd/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg
</pre>


---++ Start/Stop !Xrootd
On each node where  !Xrootd is installed (redirector or data server) to start/stop Xrtood use the following. 

To start: <pre class="screen">
cd /opt/xrootd
source setup.sh
vdt-control --on
</pre>

To stop: <pre class="screen">
cd /opt/xrootd
source setup.sh
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---++ Testing your system
 Login on the redirector node (e.g. =redirector.yourdomain.org=) as an ordinary user.

<pre class="screen">cd /opt/xrootd 
source setup.sh 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib 
export LD_PRELOAD=$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/lib/libXrdPosixPreload.so 
echo &ldquo;This is a test&rdquo; &gt;/tmp/test 
cp /tmp/test xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094///storage/path/test 
cp xroot://redirector.yourdomain.org:1094///storage/path/test /tmp/test1 
diff /tmp/test1 /tmp/test 
</pre>



---++ Advanced installation options and issues

---+++ Disabling !Xrootd's CNS
Change manually Xrootd's configuration ($VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg) on every node to get rid of CNSD.

On the redirector modify also =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/xrootd= deleteing the following lines: <pre class="file">
 if test "`hostname`" = $XRDR_HOST;then
            $XROOTD_HOME/etc/StartXRD -c $XROOTD_HOME/etc/xrootd_cnd.cfg -n xrootd_cnd
 fi
</pre>

---+++ Optimizing disk partitions for performance
To maximize the performance of your Xrootd installation, you should place the storage cache and storage path on separate partitions.  The partition used for the storage cache should be optimized for the kinds of files anticipated by the application.  In general, you can use the defaults for =mke2fs= since that will tend to optimize for large files. 

The partition used for the storage path should be optimized to hold a large number of inodes and files.  Since the storage path is used to hold symlinks to the actual data files, the file system should have a large number of inodes since each symlink will require an inode to hold an entry for the symlink.  In addition, the size of the data blocks used by the filesystem on the partition should be made as small as possible.  Since symlinks will typically consume an entire block regardless of the size of data block, a small data block size results in less space being wasted.  For an ext3 file system, passing =-b 1024= to =mke2fs= will set the block size to 1kb per block which is the smallest allowed block size.

Normally =mke2fs= is invoked using the wrapper =mkfs -t ext3 ...= that passes the options along. Use =man mke2fs= to see all the options.

%NOTE% Xrootd inherits the limitation of the underline filesystem used to store data. E.g. If you use ext3 file system you are limited to 31998 sub-directories per one directory, stemming from its limit of 32000 links per inode.

---+++ Creating disk partitions for the data servers
General procedure:
   * Choose your disk or raid array
   * Create a partition, e.g. using =fdisk= and creating a new partition of type linux: <pre class="screen">
/sbin/fdisk /dev/sda
</pre>
   * Format the partition into an ext3 file system: <pre class="screen">
mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1
</pre>
   * Mount the disk in your main file system, e.g. by adding to =/etc/fstab= a line like:<pre class="file">
/dev/sda1               /storage                ext3    defaults        1 2
</pre>
   * Create the needed Xrootd directories as usual<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /storage/path
mkdir -p /storage/cache
</pre>



---+++ Firewall configuration for the Xrootd redirector

Edit the =/etc/sysconfig/iptables= file to add these lines ahead of the reject line:
<pre class="file"># Xrootd connections  (from anywhere) 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1094 -j ACCEPT 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1213 -j ACCEPT 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2094 -j ACCEPT 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2525 -j ACCEPT 
# </pre>

Check the status of iptables: <pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre> 
Restart iptables: <pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/iptables restart</pre> 
Check the status of the iptables to see the changes: <pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre>


---+++ Firewall configuration for an Xrootd data server

Edit the =/etc/sysconfig/iptables= file and add these lines ahead of the reject line:
<pre class="file"># Xrootd connections  (from anywhere) 
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -p tcp -m tcp --dport 2525 -j ACCEPT 
# </pre>

Check the status of iptables: <pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre> 
Restart iptables: <pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables restart </pre> 
Check the status of the iptables to see the changes:  <pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/iptables status</pre>
Now edit the file =$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg= and change =xrd.port any= to =xrd.port 2525=.

---+++ Log and configuration file locations 
 
If any of the tests described above have failed or you are just curious to see what’s going 
on you could find log and configuration files for each of the module in the following 
location on a relevant node: 
|*Host*|*Configuration files*| *Log files*| 
|Xrootd – redirector |$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg  <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd_2.cfg  <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/StartXRD.cf  <br/>|$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/var/logs/xrdlog  <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/var/logs/cmslog  <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/var/logs/xrootd_cnd/xrdlog |
|Xrootd – data server| $VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/xrootd.cfg  <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc/StartXRD.cf |$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/var/logs/xrdlog  <br/>$VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/var/logs/cmslog |
 
---+++ Installing !XrootdFS
[[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/xrootdfs.html][XrootdFS]] is a POSIX filesystem for an Xrootd storage cluster and is based on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace][FUSE]] (Filesystem in Userspace). !FUSE is a kernel module that intercepts and services requests to non-privileged user space file systems like !XrootdFS.  

You must install !XrootdFS on the nodes where you want a single filesystem for your files in Xrootd, e.g. on the interactive nodes and on the !GridFTP server, if you have one and want your Xrootd files to be accessible via !GridFTP.

The procedure is:
   * Install FUSE if not installed already.
   * Setup Pacman.
   * Make the installation directory (e.g. =/opt/xrootdfs=). 
   * Install !XrootdFS.

---++++ !FUSE 
!FUSE can be installed via “yum install” or rpms. You must install three packages: 
   * fuse
   * fuse-libs
   * kernel-module-fuse

or you can download it  from   
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=121684&package_id=132802 and build according to instructions  provided at http://fuse.sourceforge.net.   
 
You need to have root access to install it. 
It is essential that FUSE version ( &gt; 2.7.3) and flavor match your kernel. Contact your system administrator if you have any questions.

---++++ Install !XrootdFS
!XrootdFS can be installed from %CACHE% cache. The installation described here is done as root even though services do not  run as root. Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (answer =yall=).
<pre class="screen"> 
cd /opt/xrootdfs
pacman -get %CACHE%:XrootdFS 
</pre> 
 
Configure !XrootdFS with the following command where:
   * =$VDT_LOCATION= is the installation directory of the Xrootd redirector (=/opt/xrootdfs=)
   * =xrootd= is the non-privileged user that runs the !XrootdFS service
   * FQDN of the redirector host, e.g.  =redirector.yourdomain.org= 
   * =/storage/path= is the directory discussed above in the installation of redirector and data servers
<pre class="screen">
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_xrootdfs \
 --user xrootd \
 --cache /storage/path \
 --xrdr-host redirector.yourdomain.org  \
 --xrdr-storage-path /storage/path
</pre>
