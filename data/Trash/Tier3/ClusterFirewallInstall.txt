---++ Introduction
This document presents some notes about the installation of a Firewall or a Router. The Firewall/Router is a box that may provide IP level 3 routing, IP masquerading (NAT), a DNS server and a DHCP server. 
Depending on your intention and how you place it on the network and how you configure it, the firewall described could be used to separate the intranet of a Tier 3 from the extranet, as the NAT server described in the "Topology with intranet and extranet" of ClusterNetwork, or it could be the Firewall separating the extranet from the Internet as in the second example of Figure 3 in ClusterNetwork.

The configuration described is using the network 192.168.192.0/18 as intranet, coherent with all the other Tier 3 documents.

The router/firewall chosen is [[http://www.vyatta.com/index.php][Vyatta]] because it is available both as hardware device or software implementation, has both a command line interface similar to other commercial routers and a Web GUI, its community edition is available free of charge.

This document covers the configuration of a Vyatta router. The router can be deployed as:
   * !LiveCD
   * Persistent Device
   * Virtual machine
Check the [[http://www.vyatta.com/downloads/documentation/VC5.0.2/Vyatta_InstallationAndUpgrade_VC5_v01.pdf][Installation guide from Vyatta.org]] for information about the deployment.

%DISCLAIMER% The configuration described here is meant only to be suggestive for a *small* environment.   Network configurations for clusters vary greatly depending on the local environment, the scale of the facility, and conventions used by and preferences of systems administrators.   You should get into contact with your local network administrator to find out more information about your campus' network infrastructure and services.  

---+++!! Applicable Versions
This software is not part of OSG or VDT. 

The instruction apply to Vyatta community edition VC5 

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
It is recommended to install the router/firewall on it own host.

If you plan to choose your subnet you should be familiar with [[http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt][RFC1918]], in particular know the IANA reserved private subnets (non routable networks):
   * 0.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255	(10/8 prefix)
   * 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255	(172.16/12 prefix)
   * 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255	(192.168/16 prefix)
And read [[http://support.apple.com/kb/TA25227?viewlocale=en_US][these useful tips]] on choosing the right subnet.

---++ Checklist
See the introduction and ClusterNetwork for a better understanding of the terms used.
E.g.:
   1. A Vyatta router has been deployed as described in the  [[http://www.vyatta.com/downloads/documentation/VC5.0.2/Vyatta_InstallationAndUpgrade_VC5_v01.pdf][Installation guide from Vyatta.org]]
   1. the Ethernet interface eth1 of the router is connnected to the network where all the Tier 3 host reside (extranet or intranet)
   1. the Ethernet interface eth0 of the router is connnected to the outside (Internet or extranet) 
   1. IP addresses are assigned as descibed in ClusterNetworkSetup

---++ First Time Install
The steps below apply to the first time install but can be followed also to fix an existing configuration.

---++ Installation Procedure
The following steps apply to the first time install but can be followed also to fix an existing configuration.

In this example the router is a Vyatta VC5, has public IP 128.135.250.17 and NETMASK 255.255.255.0 (CDIR 128.135.250.17/24). Replace these values with your own.
The private network is 192.168.192.0/18. Change it if you have a different one.

Log in into the router using the console, change password, setup the IP address and enable ssh access. The default user/password are <tt>vyatta</tt>/<tt>vyatta</tt>. <tt>configure</tt> is used to start a configuration session, <tt>commit</tt> is used to commit changes, <tt>save</tt> to save changes on the persistent support (so that they will survive a reboot)
<pre class="screen">
configure
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address %RED%128.135.250.17/24%ENDCOLOR%
set service ssh
commit
</pre>
Now you can login using ssh to continue the configuration if you prefer.
Setup the host networking: hostaname, domain, DNS servers. You will have to use your own gateway and DNS servers.
<pre class="screen">
configure
set system host-name gc-net
set system domain-name uchicago.edu
set system name-server %RED%128.135.247.50%ENDCOLOR%
set system name-server %RED%128.135.249.50%ENDCOLOR%
set system gateway-address %RED%128.135.250.1%ENDCOLOR%
commit
save
</pre>
Setup the private network (192.168.192.0/18 - from 192.168.192.0 to 192.168.255.254), the IP (192.168.255.254) and enable NAT
<pre class="screen">
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 192.168.255.254/18
set service nat rule 1 source address 192.168.192.0/18 
set service nat rule 1 outbound-interface eth0
set service nat rule 1 type masquerade
commit
</pre>
To allow all hosts to go on the internet (if you like to do so)
<pre class="screen">
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop %RED%128.135.250.1%ENDCOLOR%
commit
</pre>

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---+++ Optional services
These section contains notes on services that you may decide to add but are not required for the Tier 3 examples to work. These examples are provided as is to show what is possible. Please check Vyatta documentation.

edit interfaces ethernet eth0
set firewall out name test
commit
</pre>

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
The service can be treated as a hardware service even if it is software:
   * turn it on to start the service
   * turn it off to stop the service

---++ Validation of Service Operation
To test the service you can try to ping or ssh the router to test it network configuration and to use machines in the private network to test the private network configuration. 

---+++ Connect to the hosts in the private network
You may want to connect (e.g. ssh) to the hosts behind the firewall (your natted intranet). You have some options: 
   * port forwarding is effective but requires per host and per configuration. It may become tedious to setup.
   * If you are on the same LAN of the Firewall/Router you can use a static route
   * Else you will need a VPN (split tunnel)

If you are on the same LAN of the router/firewall, you can setup in your computer a static route that reaches the private network through the router/firewall, e.g. <pre class="screen">sudo route add -net 192.168.192 128.135.250.17 </pre>. Note that the static route will cause a routing error if you are not in the same LAN as the router.
Since you have no VPN you should pay attention not to send any password in clear because your communication may be listened before reaching the firewall. Use of =ssh= is OK.

The most flexible solution is the use of a VPN. Above is shown how to setup a PPTP server on the VC5. Most OS come with a PPTP client. You can find [[][instructions for OS X]]

After this configuration you will be able to reach the hosts in the private network, e.g. <pre class="screen">ping 192.168.192.51
ssh gcuser@192.168.192.51</pre>

#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Information
---+++!!File Locations
Configuration file is normally located in <pre>/opt/vyatta/etc/config/config.boot</pre>

---+++!!Debugging Procedure
To debug you can try normal networking commands (like: <tt>ping, traceroute, nestat -r, route, ifconfig</tt>) on the connected hosts.

There are commands to show the configuration
<pre class="screen">
show interfaces ethernet eth0
show system
</pre>

Or to remove a configuration wrongfully added
<pre class="screen">
delete interfaces ethernet eth1 address 192.168.0.254/24
</pre>

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
You may end up with misconfigured networks

---++++ Unreachable network
If you encounter an error like "bind: Can't assign requested address using ssh (or anything else)"  you may have some missing or wrong entry in the routing table.
Try =netstat -nr= to view your routes and use =route add/delete= to fix them.

---++++ PPTP Error
The PPTP negotiation may fail if the server requires encryption and the client starts proposing no encryption: MPPE required but peer negotiation failed. The problem can be solved fixing the client or allowing the server to accept no encryption (unsafe) by commenting =require-mppe-128= in =/etc/ppp/options.pptpd=.
