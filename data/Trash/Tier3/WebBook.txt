---++ Document Purpose and Overview

This document was designed as a hands-on guide to enable US ATLAS and US CMS Tier-3 system administrators to deploy a "new" cluster. The basic cluster installation creates a baseline infrastructure that experiment specific application components can be layered on top of to complete the intended functionality of the Tier-3 system. Experiment specific software (e.g. Phedex, DQ2, CRAB, Athena, ...) use and installation is NOT covered in this documentation and the interested reader may wish to consult [[https://atlaswww.hep.anl.gov/twiki/bin/view/UsAtlasTier3/WebHome][ATLAS T3]] and CMS websites for this information.

While this document is focused on the needs of US ATLAS and US CMS, other small sites may find this this documentation useful as well.

Users of this document are expected to have a basic understanding of Linux system administration but do not need to be familiar with cluster/grid systems; there are many explanations throughout this guide to assist the first time cluster installer. As such, this document also serves as an introductory entry point into the larger set of OSG documentation.

The documents below are in a hands-on format and present tested examples. Reference documents are cited to provide further background into each of the components as well as to allow admins to customize their configurations. 

The remainder of this document is divided in three sections: a presentation of the concepts, instruction to install and configure the different components of a Tier 3, examples of the installation of a Tier 3.
