---++ Introduction
%DISCLAIMER% If you install your hosts with Rocks (commonly used by CMS), or the ATLAS kickstart, or another cluster management system, it will take care of network configuration, so ignore this document. Furthermore the configuration described here is meant only to be suggestive for a *small* environment. These are notes, not an exhaustive configuration how-to.  Network configurations for clusters vary greatly depending on the local environment, the scale of the facility, and conventions used by and preferences of systems administrators.   You should get into contact with your local network administrator to find out more information about your campus' network infrastructure and services.  
For larger installations DNS and DHCP servers should probably be used.

In this module we discuss a few details regarding the configuration of the Tier 3 network.  
Possible topologies have been presented in ClusterNetwork. These instructions describe a static network configuration. A similar result can be obtained in a more scalable way using dynamic network addresses and configuring appropriately DNS and DHCP services. 

In the examples below I'll assume that all the hosts are connected to the same subnet (extranet). This is the "Simplified network topology" presented in ClusterNetwork.
The subnet used is 192.168.192.0/18. This subnet is within the blocks of the IP address space reserved by IANA for private internets (see [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918][RFC1918]]). It defines a subnet with 18 bits fixed for the network addresses and 14 bits available for the hosts. This means that you can have up to 16,191 private IP addresses from 192.168.192.1 to 192.168.255.254. 

This configuration is like the second example in Figure 3 of ClusterNetwork where the extranet with all the hosts is behind a Firewall:
   * The example can be easily adapted to a different network (available address range) by substituting the IP addresses.
   * Normally the extranet is provided to you. If you need to setup the Firewall on your own you can look to ClusterFirewallInstall for an example.

<!-- 
-- not really, depends on the router configuration  --
If the extranet is a subnet in the range 192.168.x.y, and x >= 192, then the default configuration will not work (there may be conflicts in the assigned IP). In this case the subnet used for the intranet has to be different from the default, read further the intranet notes to find out which documents are affected.

---++ Static network configuration
The following steps describe all the files that have to be modified to configure statically the networking on a host. Each title indicates the subject and the file described in that subsection.

---+++ Hostname and gateway: /etc/sysconfig/network

   * The =/etc/sysconfig/network= contains the FQDN of the host and the gateway used. Here is an example:<pre class="file">
NETWORKING=yes
GATEWAY=192.168.255.254
HOSTNAME=gc1-ce.yourdomain.org
</pre>


---+++ NIC configuration: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
   * The  =/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0= file (if using =eth0=) can be configured to use a static IP or DHCP.  The IPADDR value must be consistent with the IP assigned in the =/etc/hosts= file.  Some of the lines for a static configuration are: <pre class='file'>
BOOTPROTO=static
TYPE=Ethernet
NETMASK=255.255.192.0
IPADDR=192.168.192.51
</pre>

If you restart the network after these first two steps (=/etc/init.d/network restart=) you should be able to reach the host at the assigned IP address, e.g. using ssh.

---+++ Network map: /etc/hosts
If you are using static IP addresses, any of the layout described in ClusterNetwork (both when the machines are in a public network and also when they are isolated on a private intranet) can be described using the =/etc/hosts= file.

   * The  =/etc/hosts=  contains a "map" of the cluster, resolving the =localhost= and all the hosts both as FQDN and short name.  The file should be the same on all machines in the cluster. 
   * Create =/etc/hosts= on the main head node (which is serving as a management node here):  =gc1=.
   * Copy the file to each of the hosts in the cluster.  Make sure that any updates on the master copy on the management node get propagated.

</pre>

---+++ DNS servers: /etc/resolv.conf

   * The =/etc/resolv.conf= must contain the correct DNS IPs appropriate for the local environment.  If DHCP is used, this file is written automatically by the client. Here is an example (with public servers from opendns.com):<pre class='file'>
nameserver 208.67.222.222
nameserver 208.67.220.220
search yourdomain.org
</pre>


---+++ Name resolution: /etc/nsswitch.conf

   * The =/etc/nsswitch.conf= instructs the host to look first in the =/etc/hosts= file using this line:<pre class='file'>
#hosts:     db files ldap nis dns
hosts:      files dns
</pre>



---++ Protecting /etc/resolv.conf

The following applies only if you have multiple network interfaces (e.g. dual homed hosts), one configured statically and others run a DHCP client.
The static interface in order to work properly requires to preserve =/etc/resolv.conf= as modified above, running the DHCP client to configure the other interfaces replaces the file.

Quick solution to the problem: the  =/etc/resolv.conf= file can be write protected with =chattr= command under the Linux ext3 file system: <pre>chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf</pre>

More elegant solutions involve the setting of PEERDNS in the interface configuration or modification of the dhcp-client script or of the DHCP server configuration:
   * Interfaces running the DHCP client can control changes to  =/etc/resolv.conf= via the parameter =PEERDNS= in the network configuration script of each interface using DHCP (=/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ethX=, where =X= is the interface), which can be assigned either =yes= or =no=. 
      * If  = PEERDNS=yes= modify =/etc/resolv.conf= with information from the server. If using DHCP, then yes is the default.
      * If = PEERDNS=no=  do not modify =/etc/resolv.conf= 
      * NOTE: this may not work on some Linux releases 
   * For the solutions based on the dhcp-client script or of the DHCP server configuration or for more discussion on this topic, see: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/dhclient-etcresolvconf-hooks/.

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
The step above change your network configuration. To make them effective you must restart the network service: <pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/network restart
</pre>
%WARNING% If you misconfigured the network you may loose network connectivity and be forced to login in the console of the host you are trying to install/configure.
