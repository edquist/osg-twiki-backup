---++ Introduction
Xrootd is a high performance network storage system widely used in high energy physics experiments such as ATLAS and ALICE. This page documents a special Pacman cache maintained to permit the concurrent installation of multiple versions of Xrootd, e.g. as required by the ATLAS !manageTier3SW framework.
This document provides the instructions to install Xrootd and !XrootdFS of this alternative cache. 

To install the latest production version from the official VDT cache check XrootdInstall, for Xrootd usage instructions check XrootdClient.

Note: now Xrootd is packaged as RPMs.  See [[Documentation/Release3.InstallXrootd][Xrootd Install]] for information.

---++ Installation 
To install Xrootd off this alternative Pacman cache follow the instructions in XrootdInstall but replace the command:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:&lt;PACKAGE>
</pre>
with:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get  "http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:&lt;PACKAGE> | version('&lt;VERSION>')"
</pre>

Where:
   * =&lt;PACKAGE>= is =Xrootd= or =XrootdFS= and 
   * =&lt;VERSION>= is one of the available versions

Current available versions are:
   * =2.0-r1= - VDT 2.0 Release version (same as the version you'd install referring directly the VDT production cache)
   * =2.0-vtb1= - VDT 2.0 Validation Test Bed cache
