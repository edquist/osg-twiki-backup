---++ Introduction

In %CACHE% 0.6.0 and later, all services (=/etc/init.d=, =/etc/xinetd.d=, =cron=) should be turned on/off using the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control= script.  This section will provide just a general overview. There is a <i>man</i> page available for the script, just type =man vdt-control=. You can also [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/man/vdt-control.html read the man page online]].  Additional information is given by [[StartingServices][Starting Services]] documentation.

You need to be root to run this script.

---++ View OSG services
To view all services controlled by =vdt-control=:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
# <b>vdt-control --list </b>
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
gris               | init   | do not enable
globus-gatekeeper  | inetd  | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
globus-ws          | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron     | cron   | enable
MLD                | init   | enable
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-5           | init   | enable
condor             | init   | enable
gratia-condor      | cron   | enable
</pre>

%NOTE% This is output from a typically enabled CE installation.

---++ Shutdown Services

   * To shutdown <em>all</em> services: <pre class="screen">
 <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
 <b>vdt-control --off </b>
</pre>
   * To shutdown an individual service of name <i>Service</i>: <pre class="screen">
 <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
 <b>vdt-control --off  Service </b>
</pre>

   * If there is a problem with shutting off a service you will encounter: <pre class="screen">
<b>vdt-control --off </b>
disabling <i>type</i> service <i>Service</i>... FAILED! (see vdt-install.log)
    found conflicting, <i> ... description of conflict ... </i>;
    use the --force option to remove the entry
</pre>

%NOTE% While you may need to run =vdt-control --off --force= in some cases (e.g. if the vdt installed files have been modified), you should be %RED%very%ENDCOLOR% careful when doing this since this may disable services being run from other vdt installations on the same system or from non-vdt installations.   Always consult the ==vdt-install.log== file for a description of the failures. 

<!--   Jeff Porter, 6/12/08 simplified some text and removed the following
 - - -++ Shutdown individual services
To shutdown <b>individual</b> services:

<pre class="screen">
 <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
 <b>vdt-control - -off  Service </b>
</pre>

%NOTE% You may need to run =vdt-control - -off - -force Service= in some cases if the vdt installed files have been modified.  However, you should be %RED%very%ENDCOLOR% careful when doing this since this may disable services being run from other vdt installations (or non-vdt services of the same name) on the same system.
-->


---++ Actions taken by vdt-control

Behind the scenes, =vdt-control= will take the following actions to stop sevices.  
   * For =/etc/init.d= services, =vdt-control= will stop the service by running =/etc/init.d/service-script stop= and then will delete the script.  
   * For =/etc/xinet.d= services, vdt-control will remove the script from the directory and then restart the =xinetd= daemon. 
   * For =root= cron entries, the crontab entry will be removed. 

---++ Shutting down services on older installations
To shutdown services installed by releases of the OSG software earlier than the 0.6.0 release, please refer to this [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationShuttingDownOldCE][guide]].

---++ Hung processes
Look for hung globus-job-manager or globus-gatekeeper processes.  In exceptional situations where
processes have been hung, some of these processes can survive the vdt-control --off.  They 
have to be killed manually, if so.
