---++VO Security Support for CompBioGrid

CompBioGrid is a new VO trying to submit jobs to OSG resources. They contacted the security team to discuss their job submission mechanisms. 
   * CompBioGrid users login to one of the sites using a java webstart client application component, and then do their work.  The server side creates jobs on behalf of the users when necessary, and submits them to clusters, monitors status, and fetches results for the users, without the users knowing anything about where and how that happens.  CompBioGrid wants to keep it that way.  What we need is a mechanism by which the application server-side services can do that using OSG sites in addition to (or instead of) using its own dedicated cluster(s).  
   * M. Altunay and Jeff Dutton had a meeting on 12/04/09 to discuss how CompBioGrid submission system can be used to submit jobs to OSG resources. 
   * each CompBioGrid user has a Java application on their machines. The Java web start runs a GUI on the user's machine and connects to the CompBioGrid server. the user logs in via username password mechanism 
   * The connection between user and the server is secure and over SSL. The CompBioGrid server has a certificate signed by Verisign. 
   * The user database at the VO portal captures the user's simulation states. Each simulation has a unique ID and states of the simulations are stored in the database. 
   * The submission portal can trace each simulation back to a user and can observe the status of the user. 
   * The users can only run canned application. They cannot submit arbitrary code. The server checks whether the simulation arguments make sense. The users have no way of modifying the simulation code. The submission server limits the number of jobs per user to 10000

The CompBioGrid submission server can get a service certificate from DOEGrids CA server. Each time a simulation is submitted, it will run under the same account at an OSG resource. If there is a problem with the simulation, the resource owner can ban the CompBioGrid server from submitting jobs. This means entire VO is banned from a resource. Even if it is the fault of a single user, entire VO users will be punished together. The individual certificates prevents this situation because each user has a distinct certificate and a resource only bans the offending user. Jeff thinks that this is not a big risk. Because they have user traceability at the VO-side and find out the offending user, and restore access. Also it is very unlikely for a user to modify the simulation code. So if there is a problem with the simulation, then it is good that the site should ban the entire VO because there must be something wrong with the VO simulation code. 

We consulted DOEgrids RA and learned CompBioGrid can get a service certificate.
