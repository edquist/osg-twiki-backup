---++Introduction
   The second phase of the tutorial will describe how to make a highly available GUMS server.  For this you 
will need six virtual or real machines.  Two GUMS servers, two MySQL servers, and two LVS servers.
---++Requirements
   You should have your machines, real or virtual, ready in advance.  This tutorial will *not* cover virtual
machine OS installation. 
---++More Information
    The goal is the following:  First build a self-replicating multi-master MySQL database, then an LVS frontend
to front both it and the GUMS server, and then take the existing GUMS server installed in part 1 and add a 
2nd server as installed in part 2.
