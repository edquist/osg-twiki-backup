| The test should not have to be done on an ITB site, should it? There are limited ITB resources. ITB resources are not available to all who may be testers.  ITB has its own test plan and there are many procedures documented that are not part of ITB testing. | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 21:19 |
