---++ Before you Begin

   1 Read the [[SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] and plan your site on paper.
   1 Apply for [[GetGridCertificates][Host and Service Certificates]] needed for your site.
   1 Verify that the Operating System you are using is [[OperatingSystems][supported]].
   1 Verify the operation of your local batch system.
   1 Read the [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] notes for installation and best practices.
   1 Decide if your site will join the *Production Grid* or the *Integration Testbed* of the OSG.
   1 Know your CE's *resource* name and *resouce group*.  These are values that you filled out when you registered the site in [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]].
   1 Determine your site sponsors.  These are the Virtual Organizations that own the computing resources behind the CE.

---++ FAQ: Should I install the OSG CE as root?

*Short answer*: Yes, especially for new sysadmins.

*Long answer*: Most site admins install OSG compute element services as root. Paraphrasing from the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_think.html][VDT site]], if you install as root the VDT's programs can be made available to all the users on your system. Additionally, the VDT will be able to configure and start some of the grid services you might be installing.  Some services can only be run if you are root. _Corollary:_ If you don't install as root, you cannot do these things.  Unless your local policy states otherwise, you will want to install the OSG compute element as root.
