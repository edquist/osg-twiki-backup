---++ Update Instructions
If you have OSG 1.2.14 or later installed you can follow the instructions below to *update* your existing installation (use the =osg-version= command to determine which version you have installed).  This method will work for all OSG packages including =ce=, =client=, =wn-client=, and Storage Elements.  This release can be applied to all OSG 1.2 installations..

%NOTE% If you are using packages from OSG 1.0.x or earlier, you must do a brand new installation because OSG 1.2.x uses a different Pacman cache from prior releases. There are installation guides for installing from scratch the various components available in ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome. In addition, for experienced admins, there is a ReleaseDocumentation.QuickInstallGuide available.

%NOTE% If you are updating from OSG 1.2.13 or earlier, follow [[OSG12UpdateInstructionsPre1214][these update instructions]].

---++ Update Instructions from OSG 1.2.x to the latest OSG 1.2.x version 

---++++ Preliminaries
Go to the directory where you installed your software (root directory of the Pacman installation, =VDT_LOCATION=) and source the setup script so that the following steps will work correctly.
<pre class="screen">
cd VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
</pre>

Make sure that your batch system binaries are in your PATH, especially if you are running SGE.

---++++ Stop VDT Services
Some packages (e.g. =client= or =wn-client=) may not be running any services, however, doing this step will not cause problems.  

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---++++ Backup your software
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP_LOCATION
</pre>

---++++ Get VDT Updates
This will update VDT packages specifically.  If an update to the =vdt-updater= script is available it will be automatically downloaded and the =vdt-updater= script will restart.
<pre class="screen">
vdt/update/vdt-updater
</pre>

---++++ Get OSG Updates
The =osg-version= and =osg-config= packages must be updated on all OSG installations:
 
Then  update your osg packages:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update osg-version</verbatim>
</pre>

After updating, re-source the setup.sh file to load any changes in the environment:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
</pre>


#PostInstallConfiguration
---++++  Post Install Configuration 
After you complete the updates of your packages, you will need to run the =vdt-post-install= script in order to complete any post-installation setups needed after your packages have been updated:

<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>

---+++++ Config.ini changes
No changes since OSG 1.2.14 at this time.

---+++++ Reconfiguration
On a CE, you will also need to reconfigure your system
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>

On an SE, you may need to rerun =configure_xrootd= and/or =configure_bestman= before you start your services again. 

---++++ Restart VDT Services
This step can be omitted if you are not running any services.  If you are not certain, you can run it since services are disabled by default so the only services that will be started are ones that you have explicitly enabled.
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>

---++++ (Optional) Run !RSV metrics to validate upgrade
If you are running a CE with !RSV enabled you can force your !RSV metrics to run immediately to help validate the upgrade.  This feature is new as of OSG 1.2.17.

<pre class="screen">
rsv-control --run --all-enabled
</pre>

Running this command will immediately run all enabled !RSV metrics serially.  The results will be printed at the command line and also published to your local RSV HTML page (within 5 minutes).  If you are sending !RSV records to a Gratia collector - such as the GOC's !RSV collector (results can be viewed on <a href="http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/rgstatushistory/index?datasource=statushistory&summary_attrs_showservice=on&summary_attrs_showrsvstatus=on&summary_attrs_showfqdn=on&gip_status_attrs_showtestresults=on&downtime_attrs_showpast=&account_type=cumulative_hours&ce_account_type=gip_vo&se_account_type=vo_transfer_volume&bdiitree_type=total_jobs&start_type=7daysago&start_date=03%2F30%2F2011&end_type=now&end_date=03%2F30%2F2011&all_resources=on&facility_10009=on&gridtype=on&gridtype_1=on&service_central_value=0&service_hidden_value=0&active_value=1&disable_value=1">MyOSG</a>) - records will also be sent to the Gratia collector.

See [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/RsvControl][ more information about the new rsv-control script]].
