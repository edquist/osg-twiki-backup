* why is this a stand-alone-document not part of the installation instructions?
* ST--there used to be a whole Validation section as part of the Trash/Trash/Integration web which got shoved into the ReleaseDocumentation web as part of an earlier doc release, the osg 1.0 release I think.  The Validate documents used to be worked through one by one by the ITB sites and they would have to check off a table to say they completed the validation.
* what documents include this document?
* Strike all references to CompatibilityAuthPreconfig.. ST

---++ GUMS server
 *Note:* This only applies if you are using the [[FullPrivPreConfig][Full Privilege Authorization]]  or  the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationCompatibilityAuthPreConfig][Compatibility Authorization]] mode.


 On your GUMS server, run <pre>
$VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v55/webapps/gums/WEB-INF/scripts/gums-add-mysql-admin "{Your user DN}"
</pre>

 With your user certificate loaded in your browser, use the Administration interface at <pre>https://hostname:port/gums</pre> 
   * Check <b> Summary </b> link on navigation panel and review results
   * Select <b> Update V0 Members </b> and check for errors and updates in <pre>$VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v55/logs/gums-service-admin.log</pre> 

---++ CE GUMS-client 
 *Note:* This only applies if you are using the [[FullPrivPreConfig][Full Privilege Authorization]] mode.


   * Check that the server is pointed to in $VDT_LOCATION/gums/config/gums-client.properties
   * For use of gums to maintain grid-mapfile:
      * execute <pre class="screen"> gums-host-cron --gumsdebug</pre>  Look for error messages or premature termination.
      * Review those files created and documented in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Identifying_the_OSG_VOs_your_CE][OSG_VOs on CE]], namely:<pre>
       /etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile
       $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt
       $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-undefined-accounts.txt
       $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-supported-vos-list.txt 
</pre>
   * GT2 prima callout
      * get a voms-proxy
      * submit a job using globus-job-run
      * review $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log file for <b>PRIMA INFO</b> records associated with job. Should find records to identify the GUMS server contacted, the User DN, and local account assigned
      * can crosscheck the GUMS server response in $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v55/logs/gums-service-admin.log using timestamps
   * GT4 prima callout
      * get a voms-proxy
      * submit a job using globusrun-ws
      * review $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/container-real.log file for <b>PRIMA GT4 AUTHORIZATION</b> records associated with job. Should find records to identify the GUMS server, the user DN, and local account assigned 
      * can crosscheck the GUMS server response in $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v55/logs/gums-service-admin.log using timestamps
   * If these tests succeed, make %Y% entry in the validation table for your site.
