---++ Introduction
This is a place where OSG site administrators can share experiences installing OSG software by providing links to their own installation notes/sessions.


---++ Installations
   * *[[http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/Main/DeployingOSG1d0][UC_ATLAS_MWT2]]*: installation (pre-release) OSG 1.0 at UC_ATLAS_MWT2.  A simple CE installation, no managed-fork, no WS-GRAM but otherwise the basic requirements for an OSG site.  (Contact: rwg@hep.uchicago.edu)
   * SBGrid-Harvard-Exp attempted an OSG v1.0 upgrade on Friday 13 June (that should have been a hint...)  Things didn't go well, probably because there was no clear guidance saying to do a fresh install in a new directory.  The site has been down since then.  On Tuesday 24 June we have once again picked up the flag and are pushing forward with an install.  Updates to follow.
