---+ Early 2009 Big Update

We are doing a big OSG Software Stack update. It doesn't have a clear name yet (hence the "Early 2009 Big Update").

---++ Goals

   * Update Globus to improve WSGRAM performance and fix bugs. 
      * This will include an update from GT 4.0.7 to GT 4.0.8
      * We will also change the Globus container to have a maximum heap size of 1GB
      * We will also tweak the WSGRAM configuration
   * Update our authorization infrastructure (GUMS, PRIMA, glexec). GUMS and PRIMA will have a new interface for communication. There will be no user-visible improvements due to this change, but it will greatly simplify future development, and integration with web-services Globus. Glexec has bug fixes. The new GUMS will also provide the ability to ban users easily. 
   * Update GIP from 1.0.x to 1.2 [If available]
   * Update CEMon to fix a few bugs.

---++ Method for providing update

This will be an incremental update to OSG 1.0/VDT 1.10.1, not a new major release. That is, it will not be OSG 1.2.

---++ Testing needed

While we think that all of these changes are fairly safe, they are quite far-reaching. To ensure that there are no serious problems that will be encountered due to this update, we want to do testing on the Integration Testbed with at least three VOs signing off that these changes look safe. 

Because we will update the GIP and CEMon, which affects publication to the BDII, we really want ATLAS and CMS to sign off on this update if possible.

---++ Timeline

All dates are approximate, since they might be delayed due to problems that we experience with the software update, or the OSG Review happening in early January. We *expect* these dates to slip a bit, but our goal is to push fairly hard so that they don't slip too much. 

(This timeline was updated in early January. We did slip a bit.)

| *Date* | *Task* |
| Jan. 6, 2009 | Release new VDT with updates (This is in a test cache--not an official release) |
| Jan. 6-9, 2009 | VTB Testing |
| Jan. 12-Jan. 16 | Deploy on ITB sites |
| Jan. 16 - Feb. 15 | Test on ITB sites |
| Feb. 16 | Release update to OSG 1.0 |
