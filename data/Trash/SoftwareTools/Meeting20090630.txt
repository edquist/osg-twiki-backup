---++ OSG Storage Discovery
Ted presented his requirements and plans. Of note, he's dropped the requirement to check authorization (that is, check that a user is authorized at a site) due to lack of time. Maybe it can be added next year. 

Overall, people present were worried about the complexity of his command-line client for users. It looks like a good tool for an experienced user or developer, but hard to use for end-users. The web interface looks easier to use. 

We expect that people will end up wrapping his command-line tool in order to get the end-user functionality we really want. 

Why XPath? Ted says it's equivalent because the GLUE LDFI can be nearly perfectly mapped to XML (and is, in the GLUE specification) so XPath is an okay query language.

We like Tanya's personal project that dumps data as a table. The mental model matches that which most users will have. https://gw014k0.fnal.gov:8443/test/osg_storage.jsp

Recommendations from this meeting:
   1. Add at least one wrapper for the command-line interface that will have a straightforward interface to an end-user. For example, "Show CMS accessible storage endpoints are all sites".
   1. Add a "generate srcmp" command option to help people out.
   1. In the web interface, move the tree view to advanced tab, because it will not be the common interface.
   1.  Display results of preset searches in tabular format like Tanya has. It's not the visual view that's particularly important, but the data model that is important.
   1. It is netter to have a complete command-line utility than a partially complete command-line and UI, if we have to make trade-offs in completing the work.
   1.  Should we leverage MyOSG for the web interface. Probably.
