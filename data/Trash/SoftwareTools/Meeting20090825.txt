---++ Software changes for LIGO to access opportunistic storage
Tanya had a meeting with LIGO two months ago. They want opportunisitic storage and need POSIX access on worker nodes. They need to discover two pieces of information in particular:

   1. Is storage mounted on worker node? 
   1. What is the mapping between the storage URL and the local file system?

---+++ Changes to GIP

The current version of GIP in OSG 1.2 doesn't have the means to fill out this information. A new version will be available soon--Burt hopes to cut a release this week, though he could do quicker release if needed.

The answer to "is it mounted" is "is there a mapping?" Also, it indicates that it can be accessed via "file" protocol. 

It's not too hard for a system administrator to configuration this information, though it does take manual effort. It is put it into config.ini. Please note that changes to configure-osg already exist to get this information to the GIP already exist because configure-osg passes through all GIP configuration. (It verifies that a subset of the GIP configuration isn't garbage, and apparently verifies this new data.) 

We will require updates to the documentation and communication with site administrators to get these changes deployed and configured. 

The VDT team can update quickly. Tanya says "as quickly as possible".

---+++ Getting the data

Today, we can use Ted's tools to get this information. But  LIGO is not currently querying BDII, but only querying MyOSG. They are currently getting RSV information from MyOSG so they can find bad sites. So question is: can this information get into MyOSG? Or do they need to move to Ted's tool?

GOC is comfortable with LIGO using MyOSG to get this information as part of their production workflow. But right now, MyOSG doesn't pull any information from the BDII right now and it's not completely obvious what information to pull and how to present it. We need a good discussion about what information is presented, and how it is presented. Glue 1.3? Something simplified?

LIGO needs to understand what happens when MyOSG is down, so Rob Quick will talk it over with them. 

One idea: should the GOC use Ted's tool to merge information from GIP into MyOSG? 

For short term, only approach is to use Ted's tool. GOC would take at least 4-6 weeks, including testing.  GOC could use the tool fairly quickly. The interface to Ted's tool is reasonably stable. So, at least two months, maybe more. 

Conclusion: Tanya will talk to LIGO about preferences (use Ted's tool soon, or MyOSG in 2-3 months.) And GOC would prefer a longer design frame so we get this right. 

---++ Storage Discovery tool
Version 0.6 came out Friday. It addressed all issues that he heard about, except ability to specify BDII server on command-line. 

It now requires --load-cache before searches though it could be optional. This loads a local cache to speed up searches. It takes about 10 seconds, then searches are about 1 second. The decision about caching time is in user's hands. Brian is worried about caching. How do things expire? Do you cache bad responses? Right now, bad responses from the BDII would put bad information into the cache. This is likely to be our biggest concern.

Ted would like feedback from people. If LIGO agrees to use the tool, they should give feedback. 

It should go into the VDT. Requires Java 1.5 or higher. Not yet licensed. 

All functionality is basically there. We may want to implement ability to get information about site, instead of about VO. Also we'll need to think about the caching implementation.
