---++ Review Gabriele's request to transfer responsibility for RSV probe on AuthZ site check from VO Services to STG. 

The STG will watch over the need for the RSV probe. It is item #40 [[AllRequirements][on our list of tracked requirements]].

---++ Discuss CMS's need to advertise a CE or SE downtime in the BDII

CMS needs a one-stop place to indicate down-time and have it reflected in the BDII. A site should show up as "offline" if it is publishing but not available. There is no need to show up in the BDII when offline and not publishing data (because the software isn't running). 

Ideally, there touch one place to indicate. Ideally, this information would be in OIM, which already knows because site administrators are already publishing there. 

We have three options:

   1. Have the local GIP query OIM. This feels funny because it means that for local site information to be published, we rely on a central service. But it is a relatively simple implementation and fulfills CMS's requirements. 
   1. Have it filtered at the GOC: the GOC could edit the online/offline status based on the OIM data. There are two problems with this: 
      1. The site is advertised based on information that is centrally available, so it may be out of sync.
      1. This information won't be in ReSS. Right now that is not a requirement, but it would be nice if ReSS had the same information.
   1. Have a local tool that locally informs the GIP that the site is offline, and notifies OIM. There are three problems with this
      1. It's a change in how site administrators advertise that their site is down.
      1. It requires a new tool, and maybe a new API to OIM.
      1. The information is duplicated: what if it's out of sync? 

Alain will follow up with Miron and others to see what we route we prefer.

Mine asked if this is related to advertising drain-off, which CMS also requires. Burt says that he talked to Frank yesterday, and they may drop the need for advertising a drain-off state because an "offline" state may be all that is needed in practice.

---++ Work for Marco

Alain asked if Rob or Marco have constraints on the kind of work that Marco does. Marco wasn't aware of any, and wasn't aware of a need for the work to be focused on ATLAS needs. We would like to hear from Rob to be sure. Alain has emailed Rob.

Two tasks were proposed for Marco:

   1. Provide the GOC with RSV or OIM help, if needed. Rob Quick is on vacation, so we'll check with him next week. We are aware that adding a person to a project may not always help due to training and additional communication, but if there is a way for him to be helpful with RSV, we think it would be a good use of Rob's time.
   1. CMS has requested a site-wide monitoring portal. Alain understands what the initial version should look like, and thinks that it can be done in about a week by Marco. It's also likely to be useful by a lot of sites and users, not just CMS. Marco is cool with this idea, and Alain will write it up.
