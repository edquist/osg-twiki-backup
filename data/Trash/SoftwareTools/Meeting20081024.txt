---+++ RSV Year 3 Plan

Most people have not had a chance to read the RSV Year 3 plan yet, because it was sent out late on Friday. Therefore Rob Quick walked us through the highlights of the plan.

Right now, the plan is a draft, and they have details they will use to flesh out the document. Rob will provide an updated document by Friday, October 31, and it will include these details, as well as feedback from us. 

One of the biggest pushes in this plan is to have RSV replace VORS (via the Dashboard). 

Several things will happen with the probes. 
   * The security group will be involved with security probes
   * We need two things for WLCG equivalency. 
      * A new probe to go to worker node and test it. (may not be listed in current version of document.)
      * A probe to check if a site is reporting to the BDII

Question from the audience: Can we get copy of WLCG requirements? We'd like to see it. Rob will circulate it. 


(Unedited notes follow. Expect editing later today (27-Oct-2008))
Mechanism to update to current probe set. Not automatic
Mechanism to execute probe manually
Improve configuration with file, like OSG configuration file. 
Want to improve available calculation (for WLCG), with help from Brian Bockelman
Improved centralized web interface (as opposed to site web interface) in OSG Dashboard
Central GOC monitoring: not for WLCG reporting, but very double-checking and keeping an eye on things. Also monitor extra things like VOMS servers and BDII
	Who requested it? By Rob Quick, needed by GOC
Need some communication between OIM and RSV
Open questions
	Ease of use
	Reliability
	Selection of probes, and where to run them (not on CE)


---+++ OSG Software Tools Group Description

People didn't have much time to read it over yet. Everyone will read it over this week and provide feedback by Friday, October 31st (Halloween!) Alain will revise it by Monday, November 3rd.

When we agree on the text, we'll send it to the Executive Team for feedback. We won't wait for approval though.
