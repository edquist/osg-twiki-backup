---++ Agenda
   * Are the [[RequirementsFromSoftProviders][Software Provider Requirements]] appropriate and sufficient, particularly in the case of software developed within OSG? 
   * Mine's questions for OIM:
      a. *Profile management*
         1. A user cannot remove himself as a contact from a resource, should he be able to do so? 
            * This is trickier than it sounds, there are cases in which there is only one contact and if they removed themselves the site would be orphaned. Which is probably worse than having someone have to mail the GOC to get themselves removed. So I say "No" to this one. 
         2. If a resource owner adds a contact for a resource that didn't previously exist, that contact cannot edit his own profile. Should they be able to? 
            * Well, if the contact is not registered then this is obviously "No they should not"... Again associating a DN with an existing contact is an easy step for the GOC to do on request. I don't think this happens often enough to put the effort into it. 
      a. *Contact types*
         1.  The list of contact types doesn't match the specification we had for contact types in the past--can you explain the differences?
            * Don't know what this one means, what specification? Please provide details.
         1. What is the "miscellaneous" contact type? 
            * Contacts that don't fit into other categories can go here. It is not required so we let the users decide to add this information if they have it.  
      a. *Status types*
         1. For resources, what is the difference between inactive and disabled? Are there status types other than inactive/active/disabled/enabled? What do they mean?
            * Inactive means temporarily not active in the OSG, this is for resource that we know will be back. Disabled means gone for good... Slight difference and partially historic, but at this point I don't think we need to change it, since all options (except active/disabled possibly) are legitimate. 
         1. For entities besides resources, we can disable them, but not make them inactive. Why are they different than resources?
            * I think my above answer covers this one too. If a VO leaves it is more than likely permanent, while a resource may be down (inactive) for several months then come back online.
