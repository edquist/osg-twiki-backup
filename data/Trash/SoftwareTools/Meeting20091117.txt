---++ Agenda & Notes
   * Are the [[RequirementsFromSoftProviders][Software Provider Requirements]] appropriate and sufficient, particularly in the case of software developed within OSG? 
      Answer: Yes. Alain will pass them onto the Executive Board for approval.
   * Mine's questions for OIM:
      a. *Profile management*
         1. A user cannot remove himself as a contact from a resource, should he be able to do so? 
            * This is trickier than it sounds, there are cases in which there is only one contact and if they removed themselves the site would be orphaned. Which is probably worse than having someone have to mail the GOC to get themselves removed. So I say "No" to this one. 
            * (M.Altunay) i agree with Rob if this person is the only contact then he should send out an email to be removed. his email probably trigger other actions to inactivate the site or VO. What about the sites with more than 2-3 contacts? that is the more-often case that I encountered so far. can we then let those people remove themselves? If this turns into a complicated issue, I am happy to just use email requests. An issue i found out was most people did not know how to remove themselves. If we make it obvious to them on their profile that they should send an email to GOC , that would be a great help.
            * Arvind says that this capability is already present in OIM. Thus, no need for further discussion. Rob suggested a documentation to make it obvious; Arvind disagreed people who won't find the capability won't find the documentation either. 
         2. If a resource owner adds a contact for a resource that didn't previously exist, that contact cannot edit his own profile. Should they be able to? 
            * Well, if the contact is not registered then this is obviously "No they should not"... Again associating a DN with an existing contact is an easy step for the GOC to do on request. I don't think this happens often enough to put the effort into it. 
            * (M. Altunay) My observation is that it happens quite a few times. Or contacts use it as an excuse for not updating their profiles. Maybe you can explain how a new resource owner registers his resource and contacts for the first time and that would help us. I understand when a new resource registers, resource owner needs to associate a security contact name during the registry. Because there is no security contact for a while after the initial registry, resource owner creates a profile and links it with his colleagues DN. I agree that nobody should modify a profile that they do not own.  My question is how can we ease the registry process such that owner does not have to create a profile for the contacts. and my 2nd question is how does one person gain management of their own profile. Probably an email to GOC could solve this problem. but mostly contacts do not know that. they see a inaccessible page and close it quickly thinking it just does not work. 
            * Arvind and Rob says associating a DN with a profile will require a manual step. Currently they have not tested the mechanism. Once they understand we will revisit it. 
      a. *Contact types*
         1.  The list of contact types doesn't match the specification we had for contact types in the past--can you explain the differences?
            * Don't know what this one means, what specification? Please provide details.
            * (M. Altunay)This is the specification we wrote when we first started OIM project two years ago. I will find out the document. It was on the twiki page devoted to OIM project development
            * Arvind and Rob will update the OIM glossary with definitions of existing contact types. 
         1. What is the "miscellaneous" contact type? 
            * Contacts that don't fit into other categories can go here. It is not required so we let the users decide to add this information if they have it.  
      a. *Status types*
         1. For resources, what is the difference between inactive and disabled? Are there status types other than inactive/active/disabled/enabled? What do they mean?
            * Inactive means temporarily not active in the OSG, this is for resource that we know will be back. Disabled means gone for good... Slight difference and partially historic, but at this point I don't think we need to change it, since all options (except active/disabled possibly) are legitimate. 
         1. For entities besides resources, we can disable them, but not make them inactive. Why are they different than resources?
            * I think my above answer covers this one too. If a VO leaves it is more than likely permanent, while a resource may be down (inactive) for several months then come back online.
            * (M. Altunay)why not a VO becomes inactive for a while and then come back. We had a few VOs like that in the past. I cannot name them off-the-top-of-my-head but i remember a few emails from vo managers asking about this. In security incidents, we certainly may want to de-activate a whole VO. Again I can see this is not a much-felt need so we do not need to go do it tomorrow. I rather try to understand the statuses and reasoning behind.
            * Agreed. Arvind and Rob will include definitions of status types in OIM glossary.
