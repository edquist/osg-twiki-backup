---+ Rationale 
   1. LHC dates: my understanding is that the current schedule for the LHC is for it to turn on in September. We would need to ship an OSG 1.2 by July 1 in order to have a chance at LHC sites adopting it.
   1. LIGO really wants Debian Lenny (the new Debian release) by March 15th. Today, in practice, adding support for a new platform means releasing a completely new VDT release--no incremental updates.
   1. I really want to fix this problem that a new platform means a new release. (See #2.) This will enable us to use incremental updates even more as a mechanism for providing significant updates to OSG.

---+ Proposed Changes
OSG 1.2 will be based on VDT 2.0.x, which will contain only a very few improvements over VDT 1.10.1, and mostly related to packaging. They will be:

   1. A restructuring of Pacman and/or our Pacman cache to provide the ability to add or remove platforms to the VDT without requiring a major upgrade.
   1. Addition of a new platform, Debian Lenny, requested by LIGO, needed by mid-March
   1. Removal of most or all VDT "questions", which are asked during the installation. Most are not needed anymore, and they complicate some incremental upgrades, so we can eliminate this complication.
   1. Official support for a small set of native packages (RPMs/debs). The list of packages will be small and will only support client configurations, not server configurations. This is the first step towards greater support for native packages.
   1. Maybe beginning to split some of our install-time configuration into post-installation configuration. This will make native packages and incremental updates easier.
   1. A new version of RSV, version 3. [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/SoftwareTools/PlansTimelines/RSV_Phase_III_Project_Plan_3.3.doc][RSV v3 plan]]

---+ Not Proposed Changes
I propose that this release only contain these changes. No other big software updates, no Globus 4.2, no Condor 7.2, no Hadoop.

If this sounds disappointing, don't be disappointed: the VDT has gotten much better at making incremental updates. We'll continue to provide incremental updates we have a big one planned for early 2009), and this release will make continued incremental updates much easier. I do not think that this release will consume the VDT until May, so I expect that other software updates will happen in parallel in OSG 1.0.

---+ Details 
We will drop support for Debian 3.1 because we know of no users using it. 

---+ Schedule

This schedule was agreed upon during [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Integration/MinutesPlanningMay01][a planning meeting]] held on May 1, 2009.

| *Milestone* | *Date* | *Comment* |
| VDT 1.11.1 | 21-April-2009 | Primarily for Debian 5 support for LIGO |
| VTB testing of VDT 1.11.1 | Early May 2009 | Requires update to configure_osg, test lack of VDT questions |
| VDT 2.0.0 | May 21, 2009 | Revision of VDT 1.11.0 based on experiences with it. Tweaks to packaging. |
| VTB testing of VDT 2.0.1 | May 21 - Jun 5 | Bugs found will be fixed as updates to VDT 2.0.0 |
| ITB testing of VDT 2.0.1 | Jun 5 - July 17 | Bugs found will be fixed as updates to VDT 2.0.0 |
| %RED% Cutoff for changes to VDT 2.0.0 %ENDCOLOR% | %RED% July 1 %ENDCOLOR% | %RED% After this date but before the release of OSG 1.2, all changes to VDT 2.0.0 and the pre-release of OSG 1.2 must be approved by Alain Roy, Rob Quick and Rob Gardner %ENDCOLOR% |
| OSG 1.2 | July 20, 2009 | |
| Restart of regular updates | Right after OSG 1.2 | The restrictions from the cutoff will be lifted, and updates and testing will resume as normal. |
| LHC Restart | September, 2009 | |

---+ Old Schedule

This was the originally proposed schedule, kept for historical purposes and laughs.

| *Milestone* | *Date* | *Comment* |
| VDT 2.0 | Late March 2009 | Primarily for Debian 5 support for LIGO |
| VTB testing of VDT 2.0 | April 2009 | |
| VDT 2.0.1 | May 4, 2009 | Revision of VDT 2.0 based on experiences with VDT 2.0 |
| VTB/ITB testing of VDT 2.0.1 | May/June 2009 | |
| OSG 1.2 | June 15, 2009 | |
| LHC Restart | September, 2009 | |
