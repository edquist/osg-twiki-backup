---++ !MyOSG

There was a lot of discussion about !MyOSG, some of it heated. 

So far, development of !MyOSG has taken about eight FTE weeks, mostly by Soichi. Rob said that development effort on !MyOSG does not disrupt other operational tasks, but takes a back seat to them. 

Extending !MyOSG can be relatively easy. For example, displaying a pre-existing Gratia graph might take 10 minutes. Planning what we really want, or doing a deeper integration of a tool can take longer. Soichi estimated that for each of the proposed consolidators (which add information to !MyOSG), a basic prototype can be done in a day. This means about a week of effort to do the basic consolidators. 

Alain expressed concern that the existing plan has no task list, priorities, or timeline. 

Mine expressed concern that that the requirements for !MyOSG are not clearly documented. She proposed halting work on !MyOSG until the requirements are known. We settled on an intermediate approach: we suggest that Soichi should finish off the prototypes of the proposed consolidators before the OSG All-Hands meeting (March 2, 2009). At the All-Hands meeting, the Operations Team will present !MyOSG in detail and get feedback from the community. At that point, we'll review what should be done on !MyOSG based on this feeback. We're particularly interested in differentiating feedback based on priority: people will suggest lots of things, but we need to understand what people actually need, and when it needs to be done so we can schedule the work appropriately. 

We agreed that by next week the Operations team would update the !MyOSG plan to indicate this timeline and known requirements.
