---++ NEES File Transfer

---+++ Alain's notes from initial planning discussion

Archiving for NEES, 
From Purdue to Fermilab, initially. Goes to tape. 
May also do Purdue to UW later, but that would be disk.

Need test account (at Fermilab) so we can verify that we can do it.

<verbatim>
COPY_FERMI(File, Credential)
	0. Begin Transaction
	1. Checksum File
	2. Copy to Fermilab(File, Credential)
	((3. Checksum remote file))
	3. Verify file is at Fermi correctly (but may not be on tape)
	4. Bookkeeping at Purdue
	4a. Bookkeeping needs to be machine-readable, so we can verify file existence and checksum later.
	5. End Transaction
</verbatim>

Tanya & Alain are contacts for this work. Miron will give some UW effort to run this as a DAG.

Ruth has ownership of document and will get back to NEES.

Need full backup by end of March.

Good to know earlier that the file is transferred, before the checksum is created. 

On top of COPY_FERMI, might need to pass in directory, and "tar" it up. 

Tanya will be gone March 5-12, March 29-April 2.

Tanya's obligations: 
	* Steps 1-4 above
	* Provide tool that takes file name, verifies it is at Fermilab and uncorrupted
Alain/Condor teams obligations: 
	* Tool to create DAG to copy one or more files with Tanya's tools
	* Tool to decide how to copy set of files/directories.
