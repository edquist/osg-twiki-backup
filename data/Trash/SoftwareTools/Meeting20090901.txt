---++ State of Gratia RSV Probe

The Gratia RSV probe is meant to test remote Gratia install. It runs a short battery of tests to check if the probe is installed, if the probe has run and talked to collector, and if the name is has on disk is the same as the name it's telling to the collector. 

CMS and ATLAS folks want the Gratia RSV probe to work well. In particular. Burt Holzman brought it up on the production call because about once a week a CMS site drops off of Gratia. This causes central effort to figure out what's going on. About a month ago, MIT lost a couple weeks of accounting records because Gratia was turned off and no one noticed. The quicker we notice and understand Gratia problems, the happier people will be. 

Chris Green wrote the first draft of the Gratia RSV probe. It was given to RSV team in February. At that time, we decided not to release the probe, but wait for RSV v3. The GOC team agreed to update it to work with RSV v3. In June, GOC folks looked at it and found some problems; in particular Chris didn't understand that probe might not run locally. Arvind from the RSV team broke it into two scripts to solve this problem, but it's still one probe: client-side and server side. This lets us submit jobs to check the Gratia probes at the CE. 

The probe is currently shipping with RSV v3 but is disabled by default. Note that (if documentation exists) sites could enable the probe today. 

The Gratia team feels that the probe is done and has no effort left to do more. It's in the GOC's subversion repository for RSV. Brian has tested it on some end points and contributed some patches. Brian might have given the impression that he's responsible for the probe, but he has no time to be responsible for it. 

Brian ran the probe against four endpoints today, with a mix of working/not working Gratia. CMS wants follow through to finish this off: we need documentation, how to enable it, etc. It's technically done but we need to get it into the hands of users. 

We don't currently have an owner. Brian will talk to the Gratia team to revisit how much effort they have for maintenance. The RSV team is happy to maintain the RSV-specific (not Gratia specific) aspects of the probe. The STG will "take ownership" inasmuch as the Gratia/RSV teams aren't able to find effort between them.

Tasks to be done soon:
   * [Suchandra] Test in the ITB
   * [Arvind] Document how to enable/disable probes, so this probe can be enabled.
   * [Brian] Talk to Graia team about effort for maintenance of the probe
   * [Marco] Simplify configuration and enabling/disabling of RSV probes. This is in progress, but will be some weeks before it's finished, tested, and shipped.
   * [Alain] Talk to Dan Fraser/Burt Holzman about acceptability of easy configuration of probes being some weeks in the future.
