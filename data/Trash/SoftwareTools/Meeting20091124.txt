---+++ Interaction between ATLAS and OSG and XRootd and Bestman needs
The discussion was long, but it boiled down to agreeing that we need better communication. The first thing we will do is invite USATLAS to join our monthly OSG-Xrootd meetings. This should have the result of us gaining a timely understanding of what they need. The next meeting in Tuesday, December 1. Rob agreed to attend and/or find someone else from USATLAS to attend.
