---++ Agenda
   * Are the [[RequirementsFromSoftProviders][Software Provider Requirements]] appropriate and sufficient, particularly in the case of software developed within OSG? 
   * Mine's questions for OIM:
      a. *Profile management*
         1. A user cannot remove himself as a contact from a resource, should he be able to do so? 
         2. If a resource owner adds a contact for a resource that didn't previously exist, that contact cannot edit his own profile. Should they be able to? 
      a. *Contact types*
         1.  The list of contact types doesn't match the specification we had for contact types in the past--can you explain the differences?
         1. What is the "miscellaneous" contact type? 
      a. *Status types*
         1. For resources, what is the difference between inactive and disabled? Are there status types other than inactive/active/disabled/enabled? What do they mean?
         1. For entities besides resources, we can disable them, but not make them inactive. Why are they different than resources?
