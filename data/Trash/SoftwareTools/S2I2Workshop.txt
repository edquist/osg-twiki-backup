*NSF Scientific Software Innovation Software Institutes*

We are holding three one day workshops to provide input from the Distributed Computing, and Multidisciplinary Science communities to the NSF program for Scientific Software Innovation Institutes. The workshop will bring together leaders of scientific application frameworks, distributed computing software projects, and software integration and support programs. The workshops will be held on 30th and 31st of August and 1st September at the Westin Arlington in Washington DC.

The objectives of the three workshops are to: Identify an architectural and implementable vision and design for sustaining software for national cyberinfrastructure; and to engage a broad set of scientific communities, software integration, support and development projects to ascertain their lifetime needs for software infrastructure.

We will address the three dimensions of scientific software infrastructure   – vertical that addresses end-to-end requirements, horizontal that accommodates reusability and broad impact, and the software providers themselves who are responsible for developing, supporting and sustaining the software artifacts. 

The focus of the three workshops will be as follows:

   * Workshop 1: End-to-end scientific software infrastructures (vertical) 
   * Workshop 2: Common, open source software developers (providers)
   * Workshop 3: Software integration and provisioning projects (horizontal).

The findings and recommendations of each workshop will be summarized in a report that will be submitted to the NSF.  

The workshop will be held at the Westin Arlington Gateway which is located at 801 N. Glebe Road, Arlington, VA 22203
