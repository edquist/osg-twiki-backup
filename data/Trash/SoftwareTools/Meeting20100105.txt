---++ !ReSS probe
There is an existing probe, which focuses on checking the validity of site's ClassAd from !ReSS. While the existing probe is distributed it is not enabled by default. It needs some improvement before we enable it by default--it's a bit too aggressive about reporting critical warnings. 

Ruth suggested to Parag that we would like to have some verification on the sites end, such as verifying the CEMon configuration (including the validity of its certificate and that it's configured to report to the correct !ReSS server.) It might also include the validity checking embodied in "verify-gip-for-cemon", which checks that the GIP output doesn't have errors that would choke CEMon. 

Parag has already begun implementation of these as Java programs. They can't be run "as-is", but need to be incorporated as RSV probes. Arvind will work with Arvind and Scot to develop the probes. People had several pieces of advice for him:

   * It's more important to get the "verification" part of the probe right first, before worrying about the diagnostic. Yes, the diagnostic is nice, but if the verification is wrong you piss off people: both false positives and false negatives upset people.

   * Make sure to get the granularity of the tests right. It's hard to give a guideline here, but you probably don't want everything lumped into one RSV metric, but having too many metrics also leads to confusion.

We agreed that this is good, useful work. Parag will work on the existing probe and the new probe, and he thinks it will be ready in late January or early February.
