---+++ Announcing downtimes to WLCG via BDII

We have a solution in progress. It was developed by the GIP team. It relies on centralized information about downtime: people already enter their site downtime information into OIM (via !MyOSG). The GIP now has the ability to query this information, cache it, and report it back out to the BDII. It can cache the the downtime in a smart way: it gets the whole downtime window from !MyOSG, so if !MyOSG goes down, the up and down time given to the BDII will reflect the cached data. (That is, it doesn't just report "the last state".)

The goal of this meeting is to figure out how this changes the expectations on !MyOSG, and whether the changes are acceptable. 

Burt says that CMS is just fine with this model, and likes it because it keeps the method of reporting downtime consistent. Problems due to !MyOSG being down are not considered serious: it's perfectly acceptable for them to be handled during regular business hours. However, they do need the programmatic interface to query !MyOSG to be relatively stable. 

Right now, there are two "worst cases", and Burt thinks that neither of them are too serious.
Worst cases:
   1. Site is down, but labeled as up, not really a big problem.
   1. Site extends downtime window during downtime but GIP can't get that information, and it's not labeled as up soon enough.

This will apply some load to !MyOSG. The GIP would query !MyOSG about every 10 minutes (6 times per hour), so if there are on the order of 100 sites in OSG, we have 600 queries per hour. Rob and Arvind were not worried about this load. 

Arvind asked why we didn't have the  GOC push it directly into BDII? Burt says that CMS prefers this solution because it allows site a bit more control: they don't have to report at all if they don't want to, and they can make a local !MyOSG-like service to cache data for higher reliability. However, this preference is not a strong one. 

Everyone on the phone was okay with this plan. It will be tested in the ITB, though clearly not at the same scale (maybe just 5-10 CEs). 

Alain is worried that Miron would prefer an alternative local state that is pushed to OIM and BDII. He will try to talk to Miron about it. 

CMS is okay with current schedule, which would ship the new GIP in a couple of months. If there would be a delay for an alternate solution, a couple extra months would be okay, as long as there is a clear and realistic plan.
