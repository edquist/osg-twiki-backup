_1. Describe the Software_

_What is the software named?_

_Who is responsible for the software?_

_What platforms does the software run on?_

_How stable and mature is the software?_

_Does the software depend on other software? If so, what?_

We do not ask them what the software actually does. Rather than asking software name, I ask a *list of functionalities.* Ask a *UML diagram or equivalent* to understand how major software components are responsible for listed functionalities. This is useful to have a big picture. Also, we can use it to understand configuration variables, when something is broken.

Who *is responsible for the software* -- *who actually produced* it. This can tell us a lot about quality. *Who has the ownership*. These can all be different.

 How *stable and mature software* is --- let&rsquo;s ask for certification, tests, or any other hard proof on software. Or who used this before (referral), how long, can we call them and ask their experience. 

_4. Testing_

_If you developed this software (that is, you&rsquo;re not requesting a third-party&rsquo;s software), we expect_

_help in developing a test-suite that we can use as part of the VDT&rsquo;s nightly tests._

_Can you provide this test suite? How complete is it right now?_

Ask the provider:

&ldquo;Do you have an existing testing suite also? is it specific to security?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Did you test your software against well-known security vulnerabilities such as XSS attacks, buffer overflows, SQL injections, etc. Did you use any security testing suite.&rdquo;

_5. Configuration_

_How is the software configured?_

Ask the provider:

&ldquo;Can you tell us which parts of the configuration are related to security?

Explain why config variables are needed, what are they protecting against, what is their default value. If we allow our users to modify security variables, is it OK ? what type of vulnerabilities it would cause ? can you document each configuration variable and tell us acceptable range of inputs.

_6. Support_

_There is a lot of software in the VDT, and it is a challenge for the VDT team to support all of it._

_We need help._

_What documentation is available for users to learn about the software?_

_When the VDT team is unable to answer users&rsquo; questions or solve their problems, who can they_

_turn to for further support?_

How would you deal with our users questions? Can you answer them daily, or weekly? Do you have any ready tutorials for users? 

How frequently can you answer VDT team&rsquo;s questions? Can you give us tutorials when we first start? How can we plan the transition period: can our developers get together and have a boot-camp for a few days? 

If there is a bug or problem or vulnerability in your software, how soon you can help us? Can you fill in the table below. The columns show how difficult to release a fix by the software provider. The rows show how badly OSG needs the fix.

| <p> </p> | <p>Very difficult to implement the fix</p> | <p>Moderately difficult to implement</p> | <p>Easy to implement</p> |
| <p>Criticality High  - we cannot work without your fix</p> <p> </p> | <p>Insert your estimate timelines</p> | <p> </p> | <p> </p> |
| <p>Criticality Medium &ndash; we can wait although it will cause us inconvenience and interim solutions</p> | <p> </p> | <p> </p> | <p> </p> |
| <p>Crticiality Low &ndash; we can wait as long as you take. This is a minor issue that can fixed whenever</p> | <p> </p> | <p> </p> | <p> </p> |

General expectations

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->While producing the software which best security practices did you follow.

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->You are willing to help and respond to security issues. If you cannot have a fix, you are willing to work with us on an interim solution

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->You will give us advanced notice before you make a major change in your code (6 months) including new major releases, new functionalities, or modified functionalities.

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->You will tell us a year before you drop support for a feature (1 year)

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->You will inform us found bug fixes and security vulnerabilities ahead of time *before you announce to public.* This is really important. If we also find a problem, we will *first release it to you before to the public or to our users.*

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->If there is *a third party component* in your software and it has a security issue, *you are responsible to inform us* in a timely manner, even when the third party has released a standalone patch. This is important because we may not know which third party patches apply to your software. Especially when the third party is a heavily-used library

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->If there are any problems caused by using your software in our stack, we do not accept any responsibilities. We provide your software as-is and do not make any modifications except for integrating with our users.

<!--[if !supportLists]-->        <!--[endif]-->How can we have an ongoing interaction? It would be useful to check in every 6 months or once a year to understand your plans. For example which functionalities are you planning to improve, what is in your next release, which functions you are planning to drop? What is the feedback you are receiving from your other customers? What is our feedback to you: ease-of-use, popularity among users, performance, configuration, documentation, etc.
