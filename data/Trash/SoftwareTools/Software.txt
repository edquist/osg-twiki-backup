---+ Software watched by the Software Tools Group
The Software Tools Group watches over software that is used by OSG. Depending on the software, our responsibilities vary. There are three categories:

   * Software paid for (in part or whole) by OSG
   * Software not owned by OSG, but the provider has a close relationship to OSG
   * Software not owned by OSG, and the provider doesn't have a close relationship with OSG.
