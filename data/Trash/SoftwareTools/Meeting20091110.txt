---++ OSG Storage 
Number improvements have been made in the storage discovery tool:
   * Cache now loads automatically, and updates automatically if expired
   * Cache now loads all VOs, for simplicity
   * Configuration file to set the location of the cache.
   * Fixed "update cache"
   * Multiple users works because cache is world-writable, or users can have their own cache.
   * Cache is now more readable by users 
   * Added "mount path".
   * Adjusted user interface a bit. 
   * Improved build for integration into VDT.
   * Version numbers: three digits. Currently 0.8.2. Will be 1.0.0 for initial release. 

Now we can test from a VDT test cache. Tim thought that it doesn't install by itself but requires other software to be installed. Alain promised to check on this. *Update*: Alain checked, and it can be installed by itself.

When we release, it will go into VDT-Client. We talked about putting it into the worker node client, but Alain strongly prefers waiting for that until we have a demonstrated need for it. He likes to keep the worker node client as simple as possible.

Tanya & Alain will test one more time with latest release, then it will go to ITB as soon as possible, probably next week.
