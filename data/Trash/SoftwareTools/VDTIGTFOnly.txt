---+ VDT CA Certificate Distribution Dropping non-IGTF accredited CAs
The following email was sent on 10-Dec-2008, and it summarizes the current plan for the VDT CA Certificate distribution to become IGTF-only. It was sent to the following email lists:
   * osg-sites
   * osg-general
   * goc
   * vdt-discuss
   * tg-security

---++ The email announcement
As hopefully all of you are aware, the OSG GOC is now hosting a CA Certificate distribution. The plan is for the VDT to only distribute a
"convenience" package of the IGTF accredited CA, and for Grids like OSG to distribute the CAs they wish to distribute.

Therefore, on February 2nd, 2009, the VDT will change its CA Certificate distribution to include just the IGTF Accredited CAs, plus the Fermilab KCA, and we'll drop the non-IGTF accredited CAs. The ones that will be dropped are some of the CAs used by !TeraGrid.

Notes:

   1. We'll keep the Fermilab KCA because it's in use by VDT customers, and we expect it to IGTF accredited in early 2009, possibly before we make this change.
   2. The non-accrediated CAs that will be dropped are:
      * PSC Kerberos CA (290a3b29)
      * San Diego Supercomputing Center CA (3deda549)
      * NCSA (4a6cd8b1)<br>NOTE: We are keeping the NCSA MICS CA (9b95bbf2) and NCSA SLCS CA  (f2e89fe3), which are IGTF-accredited. 
      * Purdue !TeraGrid RA (67e8acfa)
      * Purdue CA (95009ddc)
      * TACC (9a1da9f9)
      * PSC Root CA (9b88e95b)
      * PSC Hosts CA (acc06fda)
      * NPACI (b89793e4)
   1. For the forseeable future, the OSG GOC will continue to ship the non-IGTF accredited !TeraGrid CAs.
