---+ All known software requirements

This is a table of all known software requirements. We realize that a table is not the ideal way to track requirements, and we plan to move this to a tracking system in the near future. The short-term goal is to make sure we know all of the requirements and do not lose track of them. 

Please note that this table is being compiled right now. As of the last editing (Tuesday, 27-Jan-2009) we know that it is incomplete, but we are working on completing the editing and following up with all sites, VOs, and OSG management to double-check it's completeness.

Request numbers are assigned arbitrarily. They will likely change in the future when we move to a new tracking system.

Shut off submissions to an individual gatekeeper based on tests at the pilot level 2. Dynamic modifications to list of gatekeepers based on real-time information system queries. The combination of these two should fulfil the request.  It's probably a few months away though. | glideinWMS shall not schedule glideins at sites that have declared themselves as “in maintenance” or “in drain-off”. |
