---+ All known software requirements

This is a table of all known software requirements. We realize that a table is not the ideal way to track requirements, and we plan to move this to a tracking system in the near future. The short-term goal is to make sure we know all of the requirements and do not lose track of them. 

Please note that this table is being compiled right now. As of the last editing (Tuesday, 27-Jan-2009) we know that it is incomplete, but we are working on completing the editing and following up with all sites, VOs, and OSG management to double-check it's completeness.

Request numbers are assigned arbitrarily. They will likely change in the future when we move to a new tracking system.

| 7 | Atlas | 2008-08-01 | GIP | ? | 2008-12-31 | ? | Accepted| Tool to announce downtime to WLCG via BDII<br>The GIP implements this, but it's currently a two-step process: configure the GIP and tell OIM. CMS wants a one-stop solution. Discussions are ongoing within the STG and with our Technical Director to figure how to solve this problem. |
| 8 | Atlas | 2008-08-01 | VDT Storage | n/a | 2008-10-01 | 2008-12-16 | Completed | Fully support Bestman with Xrootd and XrootdFS |
| 9 | CMS | 2008-08-01 | Brian | 1 (highest) | 2009-12-31 | Brian is assigned to the task on 4/15/09 of SI2000 to SI 2006. In addition Brian produced a document on space requirement from CMS  doc-db doc # 840 | In progress. Discussed at STG and the document is approved 5/19/2009 | change in the accounting metric from SI2000 to SI2006 and the possible introduction of space accounting |
| 10 | CMS | 2008-08-01 | ? | 1 (highest) | 2008-10-01 | ? | In Progress. STG and the technical director have made a recommendation on the implementation. Have a local tool that locally informs the GIP that the site is offline, and notifies OIM. OIM will be enhanced with remote API such that GIP can feed a site's status into OIM. The request has just been verbally communicate to OIM group on 5/21/09 | Ability to announce downtimes of SE and CE via the information system to WLCG.<br>The basic ability to do this is in place, but it is not quite what is desired by CMS. Sites can separately change the offline status in the GIP and OIM, but CMS wants a single method to take care of both.  |
| 11 | CMS | 2008-08-01 | GIP | 2 (high) | 2008-10-01 | n/a | Rejected | Ability to announce “drain-off” (future scheduled downtimes) of CE and SE.<br>CMS has dropped this request, as of 16-April-2009. Instead of drain-off, they will simply use offline. (See requirement #10)  |

| 14 | CMS | 2008-08-01 | ? | 2 (high) | 2009-09-01 | n/a | Rejected | Ability to reject jobs during “drain-off” while already submitted jobs proceed without change.<br>CMS has dropped this request, as of 16-April-2009 and will simply use offline status instead. Their tools do not submit to a site when it's offline, and they're not worried about what happens if someone else does.|
| 15 | CMS | 2008-08-01 | VDT | 1 (highest) | 2008-10-01 | 11-March-2009 | Completed | LCG client tools available and validated to be functional at all 8 CMS sites.<br>Confirmed by Frank Wuertheim on 11-March-2009 and http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/HEPProjects/CMS-Production Work was completed earlier though. |

He expects problems, but does not yet know what. They will report back after they test. |
