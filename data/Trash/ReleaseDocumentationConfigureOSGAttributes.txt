---++ Overview of OSG Configuration

OSG Configuration is controlled by one file, config.ini, located in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc=.  The process of configuration is done via a command line tool, =configure-osg=, which should be in your path after you source =setup.sh=.  If you do not configure your CE, it will not be functional.

%STARTOSG12%
The =configure-osg= script used to be called =configure-osg.py= and was not in the path - only in the =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring= directory.  The documentation has been reflected to update the current release.  If you try to install an older release, you'll have to adjust from these instructions accordingly.  A symlink from =osg/etc= to =monitoring= is present for backward compatibility.  Additionally, you do not need to run ==vdt-control --on== before executing the =configure-osg.py= like in OSG 1.0 and earlier OSG 1.2 releases.
%ENDOSG12%

%NOTE%  Prior to OSG 1.0, configuration was done via and interactive set of shell scripts, =configure-osg.sh=.  That script is available in OSG 1.0 and should work, but =configure-osg.py= is recommended.  This script has been removed from the latest OSG 1.2 release.

The =configure-osg= script takes the input configuration file, =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=, and runs the configuration process in batch mode (i.e., without user interaction).  Details about the syntax and formatting of the input configuration file can be found in  [[ConfigurationFileFormat][ Configuration File Format]] documentation with additional discussions of configuration options in the [[ConfigurationFileHelp][Configuration file help]] document.   The general format of the configuration file is a list of attribute assignments (attribute = value) broken into subsections delineated by square brackets ( [x] denotes subsection x).
 
Running the =configure-osg= script with a suitable input file will:

   * Sets attributes described in [[PrepareForComputeElementConfigure][CE Site Administrator Overview]]
   * Runs post-VDT-installation configuration of standard services, including GIP, Gratia, CEMon, Authentication, RSV, and WS-GRAM.
   * Runs additional configration of optional services such as Squid (if on same node as CE - not recommended) and <nop>MonALISA
   * On first execution only, it copies the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/locations/grid3-locations.txt= to =$OSG_APP/etc= with 666 permissions 
   * It writes warnings and messages to the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log= file.  (Verbosely with the <b>-d</b> option)
   * If the -v option is used (to verify a configuration file), any warnings or errors will be written to the console through =stderr=.

%NOTE% The <nop>MonALISA configuration script is run regardless of whether <nop>MonALISA is used.  However, it is only configured for use if requested. 

The remainder of this section will cover the various ways to run the =configure-osg= script.  You will need to first edit config.ini as covered below, then run the script.

---++ Running =configure-osg=

configure-osg currently has two modes: *configure* (configures the CE) and *verify* (runs a sanity check on the input file).  By default, configure-osg will assume it should configure the install in $VDT_LOCATION.  Alternatively, the <b>-D</b> option can be used to point to the target installation.     The following table shows the basic methods assuming the simplest setup.  

| Invocation | Action |
| =configure-osg  -c= | Fully configure the CE using the configuration file at =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=. |
| =configure-osg  -v= | Verifies the contents of =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= |
| =configure-osg  -e=   | *WARNING: OBSOLETE* in current OSG 1.2 releases.  Extracts configuration from an existing install located at =$OLD_VDT_LOCATION= or the one pointed to by using the <b>-D</b> option and writes a configuration file for it at  =./extracted-config.ini=. |
Additionally, you may add the <b>-d</b> option to your command line arguments and get additional debug logging in vdt-install.log.

%STARTOSG12% 
In the current release, configure-osg no longer supports the -e option.  Instead you should use the =extract-config= program which looks at the directory given in the =OLD_VDT_LOCATION= environment variable and then generates a file in the current directory called =extracted-config.ini= if possible.
%ENDOSG12%

With each successful execution of the =configure-osg= script in configure mode, the following files should be updated:
   * =osg/etc/osg-attributes.conf=
   * =osg/etc/osg-job-environment.conf=
   * =osg/etc/osg-local-job-environment.conf=
If this is not true, you will need to examine vdt-install.log for errors.

%NOTE% You can rerun the configure-osg script at a later time to reconfigure your settings or if the initial configuration did not complete successfully.

%STARTOSG12%
As of OSG 1.2, the configure-osg script will also enable services on your installation after being run in configure mode.
%ENDOSG12%

<!--
Feedback from reviewer was that they found this section confusing and unnecessary, especially in the install documents.  Commenting it out so we can review things later; at the least, the migration steps aren't going to work.

---++ Typical Workflows 

There are three typical use cases for using the configure-osg script:  moving/upgrading an existing installation, configuring a brand new installation,  modifying the configuration of a working installation.  The workflows for these three cases are listed here.

   * *Moving/upgrading an existing installation* not configured using configure-osg
      * Source =setup.sh= from the new installation
      * export OLD_VDT_LOCATION pointing to source installation.
      * Extract the old configuration by running =configure-osg -e= . This will produce a configuration file, =extracted-config.ini=.
      * Edit the extracted-config.ini to correct any mistakes, change any references to the original installation, and to add any missing options.  Then backup =$OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=, and then copy =extracted-config.ini= to =$OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=. 
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
   * *Moving/upgrading an existing installation* configured using configure-osg
      * Source =setup.sh= from the new installation
      * Locate the ini file used to configure the old installation and copy it to =$OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini=
      * Change any path references in the config.ini from the old installation location to the current installation location
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=. 
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
   * *Configuration of a brand new installation*:
      * Source =setup.sh= from the new installation
      * Create or copy a  =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= with information that is required for your site 
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=.
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=
   * *Modify the configuration* of a working installation
      * edit =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file with changes (e.g. new SE, number of nodes in cluster, ...)
      * <b>Test</b> the configuration by running =configure-osg -v=.
      * Configure the new installation by running =configure-osg -c=

---++ Starting with the config.ini File

This section will be a short walkthrough of the config.ini sections you will need to change.  If you would like to see the absolutely minimal number of changes that can be made for a working configuration, refer to the [[QuickInstallGuide][Quick Install Guide]].  If you would like to see an exhaustive list of configuration options, [[ConfigurationFileHelp][see the reference guide]].

The sections not covered here are considered "major" sections and are discussed in the remainder of the [[ComputeElementInstall][Compute Element Install]] guide.  This includes Authentication, the GIP, and RSV.

---++++!! General site information and batch systems
The [Site Information] section covers general information about the site.  Every option in this section must be set.  We document a few of the more confusing ones below:
   * group: Set to *OSG* for a production CE and *OSG-ITB* if you're a part of the ITB team; you most likely will set this to OSG.
   * resource: You need to register this CE with [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]] and give it a unique resource name (this is covered in [[PreparingComputeElement][the preparation document]]).  Fill in your resource name here.
   * resource_group: Set this to the name of the resource group this CE is in; you selected this as part of the CE registration.
   * country: If you are in the US, set this to "USA", not "US" or "U.S.A".
   * latitude/longitude: Set this to the approximate latitude and longitude of your site.  We've found this [[http://www.earthtools.org/][external, unaffiliated link]] to be of use.

In addition to [Site Information], *one* batch system section must be enabled.  The available sections are Condor, PBS, SGE, and LSF. 
   * In the appropriate section, change the =enabled= attribute to =%(enabled)s=
   * Set the =home= attribute to where the batch system is installed (usually we assume the binaries are in $home/bin).  For SGE, additionally set the sge_root and sge_cell.

%IMPORTANT% If there are zero batch systems enabled, the current release of =configure-osg= will fail to configure the CE and not give you any warning or indication of this.

---++++!! Accounting and Information Services

The Gratia and CEMon sections configures accounting and information services, respectively.  For each finished Grid job on your CE, Gratia sends a record to the central OSG servers; this ensures usage of your site gets fairly accounted for.  CEMon is in charge of periodically running a piece of software called the GIP, saving the resulting information about your site, and uploading it to various servers.  We *STRONGLY* recommend enabling both sections; most people consider both core services for your site.

For [CEMon].
   * Set =enabled= to =%(enable)s=
   * Leave =ress_servers= and =bdii_servers= set to default.

For [Gratia],
   * Set =enabled= to =%(enable)s=
   * Do *not* touch resource.
   * For OSG 1.2.5 and below, set =probes= to =%(osg-jobmanager-gratia)s, %(osg-gridftp-gratia)s, %(osg-metric-gratia)s=.

---++++!! Storage

In the [[LocalStorageConfiguration][local storage configuration]] document, we cover the different possible storage models of the OSG.  The [Storage] section will ask you about the available directories for storage at your site.  At least, you will want to set:
   * grid_dir: The top-level directory of the worker node client on the worker nodes.
   * app_dir: Shared directory where VO applications will be installed; also known as $OSG_APP
   * data_dir: Shared directory where VOs may save their data files; also known as $OSG_DATA
   * worker_node_tmp: Location of a non-shared directory on the worker nodes where VOs can write their scratch files; also known as $OSG_WN_TMP
