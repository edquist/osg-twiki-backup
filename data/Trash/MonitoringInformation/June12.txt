---++ Agenda
	* Hanging MIS-CI scripts
	* Future meeting logistics
	* AOB

---++ Minutes
	* Attending: John Rosheck, Anand, 
	* Hanging MIS-CI scripts: Issue probably due to stale NFS file handles. John will look at script to see if it's possiblle to easily add a test to either kill existing (hanging) instances of the script, or to not run a new instance that would tie up even more resources.
	* John reports a GIP problem: site policy field should be published, is part of GLUE schema. Should be published as part of OSG-0.4.1. Anand will send exact configuration attribute.

	* Meeting logistics: issue brought up again to get more input, biweekly meetings seems fine with John and Anand. Conrad will rustle up a temporary replacement convenor until he returns at the end of July.
