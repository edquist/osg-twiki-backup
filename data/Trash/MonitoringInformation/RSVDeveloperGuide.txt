---++ !RSV Developer Guide

This is a guide for developers who are creating new !RSV metrics or who are maintaining existing RSV metrics. 

---+++ Overview

!RSV is an infrastructure we use in Open Science Grid for monitoring the grid-aspects of !OSG. For example, we use it to verify that a site is correctly accepting jobs to run, but we don't use it to monitor the fan speed on computers in your cluster. 

The !RSV software is broken into two portions:

   1. *RSV Core* <br>The !RSV core is the underlying infrastructure that is used to run the set of metrics (tests) performed by !RSV. 
   1. *RSV Metrics* <br> The !RSV metrics are the set of tests that !RSV performs. 

You, gentle reader, are most likely to be concerned with adding or maintaining some of the !RSV metrics. 

The !RSV Core is owned by the !RSV development team (lead by Arvind Gopu) at the Grid Operations Center. The !RSV metrics are owned by various people, and you can see the list:

   * [[RSVOwners][List of !RSV Metrics and their owners]]

You can read more about !RSV [[RSV][on the main !RSV wiki page]]. 

---+++ Your responsibilities as a metric developer

   * You will write and/or maintain the metric.
   * You will inform the !VDT and OSG Software Tools Group if you no longer have the effort to maintain your metrics.
   * You will test your metric before you declare it ready for release. 
   * When the !VDT team is unable to answer questions or provide support about your !RSV metric, we'll ask you for help to do the support. 

---+++ The VDT's responsibilities as the !RSV maintainer

   * The VDT maintains the source code repository for !RSV, and provides access to it. (We use Subversion.)
   * The VDT maintains separate branches for different !RSV metric owners. 
      * The VDT will merge metric branches to the release branches as needed, and will coordinate with metric owners to do it at the right time.
      * The VDT will merge release branches back to the metric branches if needed.
   * If you need access to computers on which to test your probes, the VDT will give you access to it's test cluster.
   * The VDT will coordinate the release process with the VTB and ITB.
   * The VDT will release new versions of the !RSV Core and !RSV Metrics packages. 
   * The VDT will be the first line of support for !RSV--the core and metrics
