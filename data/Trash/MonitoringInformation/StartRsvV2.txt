---++ Start !RSV and related services
<p> Start Condor-cron and !RSV services

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If any of the services have already been started as a result of previous CE configuration steps, etc., then you should stop them and then start them again.

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --enable condor-cron osg-rsv
vdt-control --on condor-cron osg-rsv
</pre>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are using Apache to monitor the local RSV status, you will need to enable and [re]start that service as well.
