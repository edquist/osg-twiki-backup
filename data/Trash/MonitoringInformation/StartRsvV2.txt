---++ Start !RSV and related services
<p> Start Condor-cron and !RSV services (plus [re]start Apache, if you want the VDT Apache to serve your local status pages, and specified the <tt>--setup-for-apache</tt> switch above).  

<p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> If any of the services (for e.g., Apache) have already been started as a result of previous CE configuration steps, etc., then you should stop them and then start them again.

  <pre class="screen"> vdt-control --enable condor-cron osg-rsv apache
 ## vdt-control --off apache ## If you don't want the Apache that was installed with this VDT setup
 vdt-control --on condor-cron osg-rsv apache </pre>
