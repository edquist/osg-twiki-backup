---+ Introduction
 The objective of the RSV project is to allow an OSG site (admin) to run their own tests using metric probes provided; and a combination of a condor-cron based scheduling infrastructure and a Gratia based data collection infrastructure.

 The instructions in the Integration twiki web are located here:
