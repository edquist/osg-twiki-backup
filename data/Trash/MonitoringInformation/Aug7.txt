---++ Agenda
   * Information services  session for the upcoming OSG consortium meeting.

---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Gabriele, Conrad, Laura, 

   * Glue schema (Gabriele)
   * Relationship of subcluster to CE is 1 -> many because all worker nodes usually have the same head node
   * Easy to configure uniform set of worker nodes behind a head node, but never do this for Condor which is heterogeneous by default
   * Schema allows for multiple subclusters per cluster, but currently not used much is OSG or EGEE
   * Another way would be to specify types of machine by ranges

   * Stick to current schema with multiple clusters unless objections raised

   * Should Glue schema clarify contact string attribute?
   * Access control policy rule: associate CE with VOs, groups, roles etc. Request that the syntax be required, not just suggested.
   * Have to find consensus in the OSG to take to other Grids that we are able to change to a new syntax.
  
   * Shaowen: relationship between CE and subcluster

   * Useful information: Node, CPU, core
   * Gabriele will send around a document describing issues

   * Interoperability with EGEE, LCG
   * Parallel session at OSG consortium meeting, URL at http://www.opensciencegrid.org/cms/?pid=1000103
