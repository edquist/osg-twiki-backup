---%SHIFT%+ Disable a Metric

This information is for !RSV version 3.2 and earlier.  If you are using !RSV version 3.3 or later see [[RsvControl][documentation on rsv-control]] to disable metrics.

The procedure to disable a metric in RSV 3.2 and earlier:

   1 deactivate the _running_ =osg-rsv= service
   1 edit the =[RSV]= section in the resource configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini=
   1 switch =on= and =off= available probes in RSV configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg-rsv/config/&lt;HOST&gt;_metrics.conf=
   1 reconfigure the %LINK_VDT% using =osg-configure=
   1 activate the =osg-rsv= service

%NOTE% The metric will be removed from your HTML status page at midnight if the metric is disabled (set to 'off') and no longer running.

---%SHIFT%++ Deactivate the Service

In case the =osg-rsv= service is currently _running_ you need to shut it down first using =vdt-control=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --off %RED%osg-rsv%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---%SHIFT%++ Edit the Resource Configuration File

Next edit the =[RSV]= section in the resource configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg/etc/config.ini=. 

---%SHIFT%++ Edit the RSV Configuration File

The individual probes can be switched _on_ and _off_  in the RSV configuration file =%UCL_CWD%/osg-rsv/config/&lt;HOST&gt;_metrics.conf= where &lt;HOST&gt; refers to the hostname to monitor. 

%RED%For OSG version <=1.2.9%ENDCOLOR% remove the appropriate submission file(s) from =%UCL_CWD%/osg-rsv/submission/probes=

---%SHIFT%++ Reconfigure the Virtual Data Toolkit

To reconfigure the RSV part of the %LINK_VDT% use =configure-osg=:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% configure-osg -c -m %RED%RSV%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

---%SHIFT%++ Activate the RSV Service

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-control --on %RED%osg-rsv%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
