---++ Agenda
	* Followup from last week
	* Common batch system metric library

---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Eric, John, Anand, Leigh, Michael
	* No progress has been made with the issue of multiple mis-ci scripts running simultaneously.
	* No progress made on 'df' hanging on bad NFS mounts.  John is soliciting ideas from anyone who has ideas on how to fix it.
	* Anand has added the GIP site policy field to VDT 1.3.11:  GlueSiteWeb
	* Leigh: Looking for some standardization of numbers for accounting for all batch systems.  MonALISA and Accounting tools both need to do this.  Leigh suggests that a common interface (library or	command line tool) to batch systems would be useful.  For example, free job slots in pbs != free job slots in condor.  This poses issues with higher level reporting tools.  This also results in various tools (MonALISA, GIP) reimplementing the same functionality in different ways.  This should be done for OSG 0.6.0.  In order to move forward on this:
		* Leigh will compile a list of metrics that the OSG is interested in
		* Anand will work with Leigh to list what the GIP is reporting and how each parameter is defined in GIP
		* This list of metrics/parameters and definitions will be presented to Iosif and FNAL to see if they agree on the set and if they are interseted in a common library to obtain this information
		* Mike will write a report outlining these parameters and definitions by the end of July.

	* Next meeting is scheduled for July 10.
