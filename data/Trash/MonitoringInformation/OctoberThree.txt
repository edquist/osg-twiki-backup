---++ Minutes
	* Attending Mark Green, Michael Thomas, Laura Pearlman, John Roschek, Conrad Steenberg, Ruth Pordes

	* Weekly updates
MIS-CI development ongoing, questions asked about progress in ITB meetings.  Nothing ready for prime time yet.

	* Globus integration
There was a discussion about Globus integration and the number of web services containers to be deployed as part of OSG. Current choices include Globus (standalone), Tomcat and Clarens.

There was some discussion on the resource usage by the different containers.  It was mentioned that the Clarens and stand-alone Globus container may be largely "dormant" when not actively used.

Mark and Laura expressed the view that it would suit them if only the Globus container was deployed since it simplified site administration. 

Laura raised a question about the presence of the LDAP-based MDS2 in the VDT as used by the OSG. Aparently it was "grandfathered" in from Grid3 and nobody in the meeting seemed to be using it anymore.

	* SE testing and reporting
Mark mentioned that he is  working with John to get results from tests back and present using a web site.  John mentioned that SE tests arenot well defined - Gridcat doesn't properly test SEs at the moment, but newer version uses srmcp to test SE.

Mark urged John to send information to Kathy (at Buffalo) to add self-contained or dependent tests to verify SEs.

	* CPU/batch slot reporting difficulties
There was a discussion on Frank Wuertwein's e-mail to the OSG list about filling the OSG with jobs for the Supercomputing conference.

This brought up the fact that different standards existed for reporting the number of CPUs that are available at a particular site. E.g. some sites (BNL and SLAC as examples) report having 1000s of CPUs available, even though a single user might have only 70 "batch slots" available. So the information reported is dependent on the identity of the person asking the question about availability.

Other confusing factors include the reporting of HyperThreaded, Dual Core and othe SMP machines, and the overreporting of available batch-slots based on an "oversubscription" model that tries to  account for the fact that it might be possible to run more than one job per CPU.  CPUs might also be part of different pools that may not be available for use by OSG, but only by local site users.

This led to adiscussion on a terminology document that will try and hormonize the terms used in monitoring systems when referring to things like "CPU", "batch slot" etc. Mark mentioned that in Grid3 no HT CPUs were allowed, and the reported available CPU  numbers were more reliable.

The document has made some "rudimentary" progress and is still being worked on by Mark.

	* Agenda item discussion
Ruth felt agenda items should be generated from the mailing list discussions not left to participants to bring to the meeting. Conrad acknowlegdes and will adress concern.

	* ITB integration

Som frustration was expressed at the fact that some of the core OSG components (Globus/WS/MDS4) are not available in the VDT yet, making it hard to do MIS development. It was suggested that an interim Pacman cache be set up for use by developers until the next VDT release is available.

	* Gridcat development
John mentioned that a new OSG production Gridcat to be released in "about a week or two".  This is different from the so-called "GOC-Cat" which runs at the operations center.

Mark/John to create an activity with Leigh G. to work on new Gridcat.
