including lots of links to outside information.  :-)

Most of this call was a discussion of possible interactions between 
MDS4, BDII, and GIPs, and how to populate a central BDII server (for 
interoperability with EGEE) without using MDS2.  The general concensus 
was to create a wrapper for GIPs that will enable them to be used as 
MDS4 providers, and then configure the MDS4/GRAM servers on OSG sites to 
use these wrapped GIPs as providers.  There are still some issues 
remaining about how to get this information into BDII, but Leigh is 
looking into that.

Note:  This plan will require (or at least be a lot easier with) a 
version of MDS that will be released as a patch for TeraGrid within the 
next few weeks (and will appear in a future Globus release).

Leigh and Mark asked for some MDS examples / documentation.  The 
following are some links that might be useful...

MDS documentation:  "http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/info/", in 
particular the Key Concepts guide and the sections about the Index 
Service and possibly the Aggregator Framework.

A web interface to an MDS4 Index server running at ISI, aggregating 
information from several other ISI servers:  
"http://mds.globus.org:8080/webmds".  Click on the first link to see a 
summary of the data in that index, or on the "sample forms" page for 
forms that you can use to display information from other MDS Index 
services, display raw XML, etc.

A web interface that demonstrates some new providers (and uses the 
patched MDS version mentioned above) that we've developed for TeraGrid.  
This link is to a web server running on an ISI machine (actually, my 
desktop system) that queries an index server running on a TeraGrid 
system:  
http://margay.isi.edu:8080/webmds/webmds?info=openEndedQuery&xmlSource.openEndedQuery.param.endpoint=http%3A%2F%2F141.142.48.6%3A20202%2Fwsrf%2Fservices%2FDefaultIndexService&xmlSource.openEndedQuery.param.endpointKeyName=&xmlSource.openEndedQuery.param.endpointKeyValue=&xsl=tg_gluehostsxsl&Raw+XML+search=Submit+Query
(if your mail client doesn't like that long link, try this:  
http://snipurl.com/iyme).  This is also equivalent to going to 
"http://margay.isi.edu:8080/webmds", clicking on "sample forms", and 
typing "http://141.142.48.6:20202/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService" and 
"tg_gluehostsxsl" into the Endpoint URL and XSLT source fields in the 
"OpenEnded Resource Property Query" form.
