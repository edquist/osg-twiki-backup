	* Worker node stability enhancements wrt Grid Monitor
	* Feedback on push model Gridcat replacement (if any)
	* AOB
---++ Minutes
	* Attending: John, Laura, Anand, Conrad

	* Discussion  on details of use of manged forks and its impact on GridCat.
	* GridCat uses both fork jobs to test site availability, but also uses the MIS-CI fork manager to fork new processes to gather system information on the head node.
	* Manged forks may be bad for the former activity because these site-verification fork jobs might fail more often or be delayed before running if the site gets busy
	* On the other hand, if the head node is less busy because of the managed forks, this might benefit both the site probing fork jobs and the locally created information-gathering processes.

	* XMLRPC can also be used to pull information from GridCat
	* There was a security update for the XMLRPC libraries, and Anand reports that XMLRPC access hasn't worked for about 2 weeks - possibly caused by the update. The problem was worked around by using anonymous access.
