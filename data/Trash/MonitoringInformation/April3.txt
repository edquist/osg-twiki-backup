	* ACDC failure reports (Not discussed)
	* MonaLisa VO_IO problem/information
	* ITB Discovery service
	* AOB

---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Gabriele, Conrad, Anand
	* Gabriele: CEmon development discussion:
	* CEmon is service based on gip in the Resource Selection project. A version is being prepared for inclusion into OSG 0.6.0.
	* Integration will start during April, and work is being done to get CEmon included in the VDT.
	* Plan is to start production use in July, primarily working with the D0 experiment and FermiGrid, but also investigating Atlas collaboration for pilot jobs
	* Need to have as many sites testing CEmon to shake out any problems. CEmon has a simple architecture that works well in testing: send ClassAd information to an integrator via SOAP web service. 
	* Question: LDIF information converted locally? Yes.
	* More information at http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/

	* ITB discovery service publishes information about VOMS servers to the Discovery Service. Configuration included in 0.4.0, testing and comments appreciated
	* Information can be extracted via web service interface
	
	* Just for information, VO_IO: http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide#Known_Problems

	* Next meeting: April 10
