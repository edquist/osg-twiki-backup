   * AOB

---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Gabriele, Conrad, Anand
   * Gabriele: CEmon development discussion:
   * CEmon is service based on gip in the Resource Selection project. A version is being prepared for inclusion into OSG 0.6.0.
   * Integration will start during April, and work is being done to get CEmon included in the VDT.
   * Plan is to start production use in July, primarily working with the D0 experiment and FermiGrid, but also investigating Atlas collaboration for pilot jobs
   * Need to have as many sites testing CEmon to shake out any problems. CEmon has a simple architecture that works well in testing: send ClassAd information to an integrator via SOAP web service. 
   * Question: LDIF information converted locally? Yes.
   * More information at http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/

   * ITB discovery service publishes information about VOMS servers to the Discovery Service. Configuration included in 0.4.0, testing and comments appreciated
   * Information can be extracted via web service interface
   
   * Just for information, VO_IO: http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Integration/OSGCEInstallGuide#Known_Problems

   * Next meeting: April 10
