---+++ Pre-config check list
   * Ensure you have a <strong> valid username for !RSV, with a valid shell</strong> (say, =rsvuser=; you must be able to do =su -c "/bin/date" rsvuser= and get a date output to be able to proceed; a locked Unix account is acceptable); then as =root=,  replace entries in =<em><strong>italics</strong></em>= to appropriate values, and run the !RSV config script using <u>one of the following example configurations</u>
      * We recommend using configure_osg, and its accompanying !OSG-level config.ini file, to setup RSV, for simple setups in which !RSV runs on a CE or an SE; These command line instructions need to be used only if you have a very complex setup (for example, an !RSV host that monitors multiple CEs/SEs).
      * If you specify =--gridftp-probes= or =--gums-probes=, then the corresponding =--xyz-uri= switch(es) (=--gridftp-uri= and =--gums-uri=) are optional; if none is provided (i.e your CE host is where the gums probes should run/ CE is the gridftp server as well), then those URIs default to the the =--ce-uri= assuming that is provided. 
      * If you configure !SRM probes, then you'll have to also provide a =--srm-dir= value where test files can be copied over to.
