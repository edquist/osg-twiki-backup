---++ Minutes

	* Attending: Anand, Laura, Conrad, Michael
	* Conrad: summary of last week's discussion, ask for feedback on using RSS
	* Laura: Makes comparison with WSRF properties which can be gotten by subscriptions or by polling a central repository. Any WSRF implementation can poll the repository. An advantage of RSS might be that it can be used by lightweight clients. WSRF implementations in Java and Python (and C/C++). Python implementation id NOT a binding to Globus libraries.

	* Anand: Are there plans to publish both WS-MDS as well as "old" MDS information? Are there any plans to include new WS-MDS in OSG?
	* Laura: Plan is to include WS versions of current services, don't know when they will be actually deployed.
	* Conrad: message from Ruth saying that plans for modifying Gridcat will have to be discussed by management first.
	* Michael will prepare a  more detailed proposal and architecture description to be used as a basis for discussion, including estimated effort.
