---+++Configuring !RSV within !OSG wide config.ini (and configure_osg.py)

<p> The recommended and simplest way to configure !RSV on an !OSG CE is by editing the =[RSV]= section in =config.ini=. The section is self-explanatory -- each option is commented upon in detail. You can also refer to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ConfigurationFileHelp#Introduction_to_RSV_Section][RSV section of the ConfigureFileHelp]] twiki page for extensive documentation on each of the keys in the ![RSV] section of =config.ini=.

<p> Pre-requisite:    You *must* have a <strong> valid username for !RSV, with a valid shell</strong> (say, =rsvuser=; you must be able to do =su -c "/bin/date" rsvuser= and get a date output to be able to proceed; a locked Unix account is acceptable).


<pre class="programlisting">[RSV]
 . . . 
enabled = True
 . . . 
rsv-user = rsvuser
 . . . </pre>

The following snippets from the [RSV] section of =config.ini= (or =extracted-config.ini=) files on production OSG 1.0 CE's are provided for your benefit: 
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/ConfigIniExampleTier2OsgUchicagoEdu][tier2-osg.uchicago.edu's extracted-config.ini]].

<p> At this point we assume that you have run =${VDT_LOCATION}/monitoring/configure-osg.py -c -f [extracted-config.ini or config.ini]= as part of your CE install after editing =config.ini=. If you'd rather do the !RSV configuration on the command line using =configure_osg_rsv=, then refer to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/InstallAndConfigureRsvAdvanced][advanced !RSV configuration twiki page]].
