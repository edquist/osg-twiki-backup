---++ Agenda
   * GUMS Monitoring

---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Conrad, Gabriele, John Roscheck, Anand, Laura, Mike

   * Continuing to discuss possible developments of GUMS monitoring services and integration with OSG monitorin.
   * John Hover from the GUMS development team posted some comments on last week's meeting minutes at April17
   * Gabriele: it is possible to probe GUMS servers by using GIP: VDT version 1.3.11 distributes gums clients, so the infrastructure is partially in place.
   * Question is who to do the work? Privilege project very busy.
   * Gabriele looking into issue. Student could do the work, need to learn infrastructure, probes to integrate with GIP, BDII, other monitoring information publication infrastructure. Prefer to not supervise student, priority not high enough to spend time now.
    
   * John: Working on VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS monitoring. Some interest on testing, building e-mail alert system to send mail to GOC. Expect to have it working this week.
   * Will look into GOC mailing list facilities.

   * No meeting next week, meeting on the 8th of May.
