---++ !RSV Owners

---++ !RSV Core
The infrastructure supporting the development and execution of probes is owned by the !RSV development team at the GOC, headed by Arvind Gopu.

---++ !RSV Metrics

Note: A metric is a single test performed by RSV. A probe is a file that executes one or more metrics. In many cases there is one metric per probe, but not always. Historically, people have talked about "probes", but metrics are what users should be aware of, so please think and talk about metrics more than you think or talk about probes. :)
