---++ Minutes

Attending Mark Green, Michael Thomas, Laura Perlman, Matteo Mellani, Conrad, Frank Wuerthwein (fkw), Bockjoo Kim, Alain Roy, Ruth Pordes, John Rosheck.

Mark: starting real work: look at exit codes, job monitoring, GT4, new  GIP - installed at Buffalo.

Matteo: Accounting - plan is to implement a system using Clarens, use SourceForge for a project site. Looked at licensing. Trying to find a name for the system.

"OSG Accounting system not a good name?" -fkw. Matteo will send mail to the list to ask for suggestions.

Fkw, how to install MIS-CI, as root/non-root installed? Test that it can be installed as intended.
Script needs to run condor status - can only be done as root on Fkw's site.

MIS-CI should tell admins how to install, what it needs to do and the privileges it needs. Scripts run as a client, but could execute code as root (Mark).  Mark stresses that running MIS-CI scripts as root is not advisable, fkw understands and accepts the risk.

Bockjoo - even scripts running as a normal user can be problematic. (due to DoS?)

MIS-CI will change significantly before 0.4, but Mark still advises not to run it runs at root. Root requirement has to do with Gridcat, which will change.

Question: Which uses the information that MIS-CI collects? Only Gridcat at the moment. But anyone can be a consumer. E.g. the Gridcat/ACDC/MonaLISA monitoring pages. 

ACDC also consumes MIS-CI information -Mark.


Mark: advertise to the group of formation of small working group of OSG monitoring metrics: e.g. definition of batch slots/ CPU units.
Foresee a month-long effort to form a vocabulary to communicate with all players in OSG where Monitoring information is concerned.

Contact Mark to participate and for more information. Fkw offered to write down discussions on Metrics between himself/Miron/Ruth/MArk will upload as an OSG document for comment/additions. 

Should the discussion be on the TWIKI with documents on OSG? Comments between 4 parties above, then set up TWIKI page for further discussion to be finalized within a month. Needs to be done before 0.4.

John at IU: official time on GOC-specific Gridcat that may be more applicable to OSG operations. Have significant effort to contribute.

Next meeting time on Sept 19, 12 PM Eastern/ 9 AM Pacific.
