---++ Agenda
   * Updates on previous topics (GUMS etc.)

---++ Minutes
   * Attending:  Gabriele, Eric, Conrad, Anand, Shaowen, 

   * Anand looked at GUMS monitoring script, could do mapping with own and server certificates, need to add certificate to LDAP server to do mapping automatically. Otherwise the integration with GIP looks straightforward. Will work with Gabriele to find problems.

   * Gabriele would like to use CEMon, will be part of VDT 1.3.11. Already testing new VDT beta, close to being useful.
   * No meeting next week due to Memorial day holiday.
