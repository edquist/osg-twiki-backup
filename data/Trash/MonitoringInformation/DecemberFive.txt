	* Iowa GIP configuration in 1.3.9
	  softlink in release or look in more than one place for configuration
	* Request for backward compat: make softlink in /etc/grid-security: talk to grid security folks

	* Mark: GIP issues of MIS-CI resolved. No release yet, but moving faster. GIP integration into MIS-CI essential for a functional new release.
	* Late stages of integration may have MIS-CI prerelease, OSG 0.4 should be out by the end of the year, maybe too soon.
	* 0.4.1 release will happen by Feb end. Globus Toolkit 4 pre/web services change is biggest in 0.4 impacting a lot of components.
	* Shaowen: GIP changes: Storage info published, but full dynamic publication not likely for the end of dec. Feb more likely. 
	* Static info by end Dec more realistic. Good feedback on GIP ease of installation, thanks to Shaowen.
	* Laura: Getting new info providers into GTK for TG. Assume WS-Gram would be used. Willing to create patch for WS-based providers for OSG
	* Question for Leigh: Are WS being consumed into OSG version of GTK? Burt will write mail.
	* Mark: MDS 2 is acceptable, but would like to use MDS4.
