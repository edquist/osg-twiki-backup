---++ Agenda
   * No agenda items rceived

---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Mark Green, Laura Pearlman, Ruth Pordes, Conrad Steenberg

   * Short discovery service discussion:

Ruth: Expectations for OSG 0.4: not enough info on discovery goals 
Too little information on discovery service schemas, and what is published into the discovery service.

Also a question about the state of Discovery service and who is using it. Note that currently deployed discovery service at the OSG GOC does not work with Safari;

Conrad: Michael working on new version, testing with Safari. He is still in Brazil (or en route) refer technical details to him.

   * Discussion about integration/releases and OSG core services


- In the VDT there are currently  multple web service containers 

- Globus not running under tomcat yet in VDT 1.3.7 goal for 1.3.8 to start with JClarens under the same Tomcat instance

- Mark: minutes of vdt not sent out. Ruth: get them from same place as announcement

- Mark: VDT release dalays development 

- still not starting GT4 under a container yet: not working in VDT. 

- Mark: need GT4 to work: integtration needs to supply working WS container

- Listing of core infrastructure/ optional components needed: core required for developers to work on 

- Ruth: Part of 1.3.7 delay was to get Globus 4.01 in, as well as compatibility testing between 3.21 and 4.01

- Mark Delay between Globus release and availability in VDT too long

- Mark: Suggests own (OSG) pacman cache to be merged upstream so that developers can move forward. Who to work on this cache? Integration/deployment: Ruth writing mail

- What is the core infrastructure required for a CE. Add optional services by different stakeholders later

- Conrad: Discuss use of JClarens/Globus for MIS/CI.

- Mark: Concern about non working GT4 WS container

- Laura: no bugzilla bugs filed

- Could install manually into tomcat, Mark did that, but can't start developing until agreement on core components to be deployments

- Too many components in VDT - many stakeholders
- Ruth: Basic issue was that OSG MIS/CI needed GT4 and it wasn't ready there for 1.3.7 delayed
- Mark: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/GUMS optional: not core
- Ruth: OSG has a commitment to integrate extended infrastructure

- Need to have a deployment meeting to define core infrastructure

- Mark: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/GUMS/GT4 in same container: shuold never happen. This is a Deplomyent issue to be defined

- Next meeting: Sept. 26
