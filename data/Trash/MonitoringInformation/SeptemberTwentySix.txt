---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Conrad Steenberg, Shaowen, John Roshek

Shaowen discussed a new GIP configuration tool that was put in the ITB cache, and would also be in the next VDT realese, 1.3.7. Feedback from sites about the configuration tool would be welcomed.

This tool allows the GIP admin to automatically create the entire GIP configuration with a single command.

John asked about where information can be obtained for this tool, with the answer that it is in the OSG Twiki site. There was some discussion about the difficulty in navigating the Twiki to find the page one wants.

John asked whether this tool would help with SE configuration. Apparently the configuration created is that of a "Classic SE", but this can be changed to use the information in $DATA as well. It was mentioned that Bockjoo Kim also has a page about SE configuration under Documentation/SE/admins on the Twiki.

Conrad: this was a lightly attended meeting with some technical difficulties in dialling in early in the meeting for some. The next meeting will be at the same time/place.
