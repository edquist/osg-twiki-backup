---++ RSV Code Repository Access

The !RSV source code is kept in a Subversion source code repository hosted by the VDT. You can find it at:

=https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/=

Everyone has read-only access. If you are developing or maintaining RSV probes that need to be part of the RSV distribution, you should contact the VDT team to request write-access to the repository. 

Currently, access is provided with a username/password. We haven't yet set up X509 access. 

There are two steps to get access:

   1. Generate a password for yourself by running the following command:<br><verbatim>htpasswd -c passwd.file SOMEUSER</verbatim>
   1. Mail =passwd.file= to vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org with a request for access. Tell us your preferred user name and we'll give it to you if its not already taken.
