---+ RSV Code Repository Access

---++ Introduction 
!RSV source code is kept in Subversion at the GOC.  You should be able to access it from =http://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/rsv/trunk/=. Any one with Internet connectivity can export the !RSV source from the SVN trunk.

However, write-access (=commit=) is restricted to a list of developers, via X509 certificates -- if you would like to be an RSV developer, then [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/rsv-contact-info.html][contact the RSV team]], and provide your DN string requesting write-access -- <font color="red">*Note to rsv-dev*: At this time only GOC staff have the ability to add DNs to authorization list for write access.</font>. 

---++ Setting up X509 certificate authentication on your client

   * First, make sure you have your user certificate is exported out of your browser, and stored somewhere in your development box where you will be using svn. 
   * Say, it is in a file =~/.globus/my.p12=. See [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGet#Export_Back_up_your_certificate][this document for more details]] if you are not sure how to do that. You can provide this file's location and pass-phrase when you do a =svn commit=. Or ...
   * To avoid typing the location of CA and pass-phrase every time you use svn, add following entries (including the passphrase you used to export your cert) on your =~/.subversion/servers=
 <pre>   [groups]
   iu = *.rtinfo.indiana.edu
   
   [iu]
   ssl-client-cert-file = /home/foo/.globus/my.p12
   ssl-client-cert-password = xxxxxx</pre>

   * Please be sure to put full path on ssl-client-cert-file. (i.e do not use =~/.globus/my.p12=). If you are going to store your passphrase in the file, then make sure to chmod 600. And that's it! 


---++ Check out the RSV source code
To check out, make sure the subversion client is installed (for example, =yum -y install subversion=, and run the following command:

<verbatim>
svn co https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/rsv/trunk/ rsv
</verbatim>
