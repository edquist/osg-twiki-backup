---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Leigh, Shaowen, John R., Gabriele, Laura, Conrad

	* Gabriele: CEmon in contact with glite developers. Aim is to provide a resource selection infrastructure for D0 VO, as a general service. Use JDL within Condor framework. Have a central information gatherer in fthe form of classads - forward to the Condor collector, sent via a Cemon sends via web service. 

Implement new dialect to represent information about a CE both in LDIF and classad form. Italian developed plugin to handle extra attributes. Testing in progress. Although it is a new dialect, the information gets presented to Condor in the Classadd 1.1 (?) format. The new dialect has a notion of CEs, clusters and subcluster elements that can be adressed/queried on.

	* 0.4: Shaowen: Sun Grid Engine (SGE) portal-type interface provided by BNL, being tested at BU. 

	*  Shaowen: Multivalue attribute support in classadd?
		Gabriele: developing functions inside requirements attributes that can help with resource selection to match site strings.
		Some discussion on implementation details to be worked out between G and S.

	* Leigh installed MDS, opened a bug item in Globus to have issues reported last week addressed.

	*  Gridcat and MIS-CI developers not present, so no status updates on those items this week.
