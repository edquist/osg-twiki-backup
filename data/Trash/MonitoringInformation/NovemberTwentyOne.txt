   * SC experience: Laura: Gridftp outside the Java Container, monitored with MDS. Getting use out of MDS for debugging. 
   Trial & Error: manual service registration. Auto-registration not really sensible for non-Java apps. May look at API for registration.

   * Software discovery in CMS software release. Installed at Caltech, Nebraska. See http://discover.gridservice.info for demonstration interface.
   * Ruth: Production sites not reporting properly to MonaLisa OSG monitoring. Will send a URL to the list.
   * MIS might need to formulate policy to specify what needs to be reported.
   * Next meeting on December 5, due to the Thanksgiving holidays this week.
