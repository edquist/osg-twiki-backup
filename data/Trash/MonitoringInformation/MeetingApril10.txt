---++ Agenda
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/GUMS Monitoring 
   * Problems with GIPs

---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Gabriele, Conrad, Anand, Laura, John Roscheck, Steve Timm
   
   * Steve: Seems to be a problem with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and GUMS servers becoming unavailable because of dying processes (e.g. slapd), or sometimes stuck httpd processes
   * John: Nagios monitoring warns of unreachable http servers where deployed.
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers can be monitored by running *voms proxy init* remotely or connecting to the http port
   * Gabriele: GUMS can also be queried remotely using simple Java clients
   * These Java clients would need a special admin certificate to do that: operational/installation issue. ACDC already does something similar at some sites (needing special certificate)
   * Laura: MDS has facilities to periodically run probes that can be used.
   * Anand: Firewalls might prove a problem for remote probing, maybe run probes on the site, or on machine.
   * Need to contact and coordinate with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS/GUMS authors on how to best do monitoring that gives exact information and integrates with OSG monitoring infrastructure.

   * John reports seeing problems with GIPs on gatekeepers dying periodically, with 0.6.3 and 0.7 this seems to be a more general problem
   * Anand: this may be a problem with the GRIIS
   * John will set up more frequent querying of GIPs to see if problem can be narrowed down/debugged (15 minutes frquency is suggested).

   * Next meeting: April 17
