---++ Agenda
	* VOMS/GUMS Monitoring 
	* Problems with GIPs

---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Gabriele, Conrad, Anand, Laura, John Roscheck, Steve Timm
	
	* Steve: Seems to be a problem with VOMS and GUMS servers becoming unavailable because of dying processes (e.g. slapd), or sometimes stuck httpd processes
	* John: Nagios monitoring warns of unreachable http servers where deployed.
	* VOMS servers can be monitored by running *voms proxy init* remotely or connecting to the http port
	* Gabriele: GUMS can also be queried remotely using simple Java clients
	* These Java clients would need a special admin certificate to do that: operational/installation issue. ACDC already does something similar at some sites (needing special certificate)
	* Laura: MDS has facilities to periodically run probes that can be used.
	* Anand: Firewalls might prove a problem for remote probing, maybe run probes on the site, or on machine.
	* Need to contact and coordinate with VOMS/GUMS authors on how to best do monitoring that gives exact information and integrates with OSG monitoring infrastructure.

	* John reports seeing problems with GIPs on gatekeepers dying periodically, with 0.6.3 and 0.7 this seems to be a more general problem
	* Anand: this may be a problem with the GRIIS
	* John will set up more frequent querying of GIPs to see if problem can be narrowed down/debugged (15 minutes frquency is suggested).

	* Next meeting: April 17
