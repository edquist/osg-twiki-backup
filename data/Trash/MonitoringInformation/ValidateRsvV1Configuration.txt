   * You can check all the condor-devel RSV jobs that got submitted typing:

     <p> What the above display shows are a bunch of <tt>probe_wrapper.pl</tt> jobs that are running the probes; one of those that's running the periodical proxy generator if you setup !RSV to use a service cert; and most likely 3 consumer jobs that generate local HTML pages and rotate them nightly, and upload records to the GOC !RSV collector.

   * <p><strong>Service cert proxy if applicable:</strong> If you setup !RSV to use a service certificate, then you should see the proxy for it in <tt>/tmp/rsvproxy</tt> (unless you specified it to be a different filename)

   * <p><strong>Local !RSV status page :</strong> After waiting about 15 minutes, check out the local status web page that is created with results of RSV probe runs each day. By default, this page is =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/output/html/index.html=, but can be reconfigured. You can either view the local status pages directly on the monitoring host ; or you can view these pages on the web at !https://&#60;FQDN_of_monitoring_host&#62;:8443/rsv, once again assuming you configured !RSV to use the !VDT Apache using the =--setup-for-apache= switch during config time. Beware that you <em>need to have an !OSG approved cert loaded in your web browser</em> to be able to view them page. The status pages should look similar to [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/sample_status.html][what is documented here]].

   * <p><strong>RSV output record upload to central collector (using Gratia transport):</strong> Look at Gratia consumer log file: =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/logs/consumers/gratia-script-consumer.out= to see if probe results were uploaded successfully to the !GOC maintained !RSV database. You should a bunch of entries similar to this:
   <pre class="programlisting">   08-20-2007 16:35:26 - Executing script '/usr/local/grid/ . . . record.py'
   OK </pre> You can also email the !GOC to check if the records got through. We'll have a page to go check on this !RSN.
