---++ Agenda
	* GUMS Monitoring 

---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Michael, Conrad, Anand, Gabriele, John Roscheck, Leigh

	* What to monitor? Do a mapping? A ping?
	* Monitor probes could be run using VORS, with information reported on the web page. VORS can be adapted to make programmatic access possible
	* How is a new GUMS instance detected? Currently manually reported to operations staff
	* Leigh: CE monitoring can possibly be used to report that GUMS is used.

	* Q: external access to GUMS assumed? How about firewall settings, or if the instance is running on an internal network?
	* Gabriele: Look for common solution with European efforts, which uses entirely different technologies.
	* How should new servers be registered should be discussed?
	* FYI, Leigh compiled a report of GUMS servers several months ago, at http://www.ivdgl.org/~leighg/gums-report.html

	* vdt-1.3.11 needed for Gums memory fix, need to coordinate with VDT/GUMS release teams.

	* GUMS config template file supplied with the distribution, could be used to set up access from a central host.

	* Michael: suggest using discovery service, putting publication code in GUMS itself, rather than using external scripts like in VOMS. Example code exists in JClarens.
	* Anand: suggest using GIPs for information publication

	* John: VORS monitoring display change: monitor.grid.iu.edu
