---++ Agenda
   * Updates on previous topics (GUMS etc.)
   * VOMS monitoring

---++ Minutes
   * Attending: Conrad, John Rosheck, John Hover, Gabriele, Anand, 
   * Gabriele: Investigating how to use Java clients to monitor the GUMS server, integrating with the GIP. Use LDAP server certificate. testing will be done for a non-existent user for security reasons. All run by script that does the reporting, export to LDIF format for the GIP. Good progress, with no big problems forseen.
   * John Hover: Non-existent account may not be needed.
   * Non-existent user means the mapping exists in GUMS but not on the server.
   * Gabriele will work with Anand to integrate GUMS probe.

   * VOMS monitor online, that checks VOMS servers URL at: http://voms-monitor.grid.iu.edu, alerts sent to John R's e-mail, but will set up a mailing list for alerts to be sent to.
   * GUMS publishes information to LDAP, so the LDAP servers of sites could be scanned remotely to collect the information. Eventually  alerts could be sent to a GUMS list as well.
