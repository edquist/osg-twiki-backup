---+++ Additional hacks necessary for !RSV 3.x to be able to test OSG 1.0.x CEs

<p> To ensure, !RSV 3.x is seamlessly able to test an existing OSG 1.0.x CE, please do the following:
   * On your 1.0.x CE, symlink the =osg-version= script to its new expected location (as of OSG 1.2)
 <pre class="screen">
mkdir -p $VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin
ln -s $VDT_LOCATION/osg-version $VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/osg-version
</pre>
