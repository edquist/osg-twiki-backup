---+ Advanced !RSV configuration

Most site administrators will be able to configure !RSV by doing the following steps:
   * Edit the [RSV] section in config.ini
   * Run =configure-osg -c=
   * Done!  Once you enable services (via =vdt-control=) you've got a working !RSV installation.

This page is intended for admins who need to do more than the basic configuration allows for, such as:
   * enable metrics that are not enabled by default
   * change parameters that are passed to the metrics

---++ Using rsv-control to enable/disable metrics

Write this!

---++ Editing !RSV configuration files

#MetricConfig
---+++ Options to metrics:
=$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/etc/metrics/*.conf=
The files in this directory are intended to be edited by site admins.  Any key=value pairs inside of this file will be turned into command line parameters to the probe.  For example, for this file:
<pre class="screen">
[org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry args]
warning-hours = 6
error-hours = 12
</pre>
This would convert to =--warning-hours 6 --error-hours 12=

---++++ Meta files:
=$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/meta/metrics/*.meta=

The files in this directory contain meta information about the metrics are not intended to be edited.  If you think there is a mistake in one of the .meta files or if you think you need to override one of the settings in the .meta file please contact vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org

| *Setting* | *Values* | *Details* |
| enabled | &lt;consumers&gt; | Comma-separated list of consumers to be enabled |
| timestamp | local | If this is set to local, a record with a local timestamp will be supplied to the consumer.  If this is set to any other value, or is not set, a record with the GMT will be created. |

---+++ Options in rsv.conf:
=$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/etc/rsv.conf=
| *Setting* | *Values* | *Details* |
| user | &lt;username&gt; | The UNIX username that owns RSV.  This is mandatory |

| proxy-file | &lt;path&gt; | Alternative to service-cert.  The absolute path where the user proxy file is located.  This will not be auto-regenerated. |
| details-data-trim-length | &lt;integer&gt; | The number of bytes to trim the detailsData section to.  If set to 0 no trimming will occur. |
