---++ Agenda
	* MIS-CI development 
	* Gridcat development, using Gridcat as an ML sensor
	* Meeting next week

	
---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Michael Thomas, Conrad Steenberg, Bockjoo Kim, Dane Skow, Shaowen Wang, John Rosheck
	* Next meeting on the 21st due to SC2005 in Seattle
	* Gridcat update from Bockjoo:
<verbatim>
Bockjoo gave an updated gridcat version of MIS-CI to Leigh (v 0.3).
Bockjoo heard Leigh and John Weigand are testing it.
Bockjoo haven't heard status of testing.

GridCat side:
0) GridCat 0.8.9-15 is the latest dev. version
	 The next candidate OSG production gridcat instance
	 ( http://testcat.grid.iu.edu/ ) is 0.8.9-12 but I gave all the update
	 that will lead to 0.8.9-15 to John Rosheck. But I am not
	 sure if he patched all the update yet.
1) Client dev with BNL/ANL for http proxy site
2) TeraGrid included in ITB gridcat (TeraGrid_UC-ANL : sidte admin=Greg 
Gross)
3) Working with LBL (Alex Sim) to use LBL's srm-tester
	 for SE tests. (at the moment, srm-tester is only in LBL site test)
4) WS handling : Being considered as Bockjoo would support
						WS-Gram display at least as a bridge
						to other more advanced cataloging system
						which we don't know what it will be yet.

</verbatim>
	* Gridcat part of MIS-CI in maintanance modde
	* Take a look at sending Gridcat parameters to ML, Conrad volunteers to add functionality to publish parameters to 
	* Development version of Gridcat is 0.8.9-15, not in test catalog 
	* BNL/ANL has http proxy 
	* !TeraGrid_ANL added to GC configuration, use SRM tester from LBL, work with Alex Sim
	* New Discovery service Released as part of JClarens sent to VDT
	* Might try to update ITB Discovery instance before next VDT

	* Dane: looking for documentation, will work with Michael to update wiki. Unclear on who the separation between resource catalog and discovery service. Also want validation of standard OSG services - Gridcat. Also resource selection, where does that fit in
	* Resource Selection Service Gabriele is working on (prototype for DZero) is done in context of CEmon publishing Condor classads. Glue schema is encoded in classad format. Input is LDIF
	* Architectural assumption: 
		* catalog publish service existence and contact information, 
		* matchmaker goes to service to get information in Glue scheme through standard query interface (which? MDS4 ? 2 ?, ???),
		* GIP is the reference implementation of sensors to fill the GLUE schema.
	* LCG has a resource broker. Currently in OSG the resource has to be queried directly - interface not defined yet. Wehereas, CEMon pushes information.
	* CEMon pushs information to a query location, so resources need not be polled. Is this a desireable architectural decision ? On what timescale ?
	 * Possible candidates include MDS and Discovery Service.

	* Bockjoo: status of GIP configuration scripts? San Diego confiuration not working yet. VDT 1.3.7 has SRM configuration for GIP.
 Shaowen taling to SRM experts at FNAL about configuration. Buffalo Sun Grid Engine provide information to GIP.
