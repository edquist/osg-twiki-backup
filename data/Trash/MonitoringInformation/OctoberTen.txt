-- Main.ConradSteenberg - 10 Oct 2005
	* Attending: Michael Thomas, Laura Pearlman, Shaowen Wang, John Roschek, Conrad Steenberg, Gabrielle Garzoglio, Tanya Levshina, Leigh Grundhoefer, Rob Gardener (?), Marko (?) at FNAL. 

	* Experience with CEMon, ReSS from Glite: Gabrielle mentions the aim of providing a provide a generic service so that jobs can be submitted to resources that qualify for D0. Second phase: resource selector should be general (both D0 and OSG sites).

The plan to deploy CEMon as part of OSG because it has capability to gather Glue schema info in classadd info, which can be fed directly into the Condor Condor Matcmaker, thereby making the scheduling proccess more efficient.

Already started to investigate how well CEMmon workswith Glite and VDT. Note that this doesn't require using the full Glite Workloaf management system (WMS), only CEMon.

Tanya: Installation: install from VDT 1.3.7 successful, but CEMon version is 1.3 instead of 1.4 - took latter and install op top of VDT (1.3.7). Problem: tomcat only accepts old proxy format (-old) Problem with Apache server.

Using the  Glite trust manager it was found that it cannot handle certificate chain correctly: use proxy ID instead of certificate ID,  requiring sites to put both DNs in the  Gridmap file.

In the course of the current tests, the LCG information provider was used to publish the classadd info.  Would be interested in GIP in future instead. 

Currently information is gathered from a CEMon web service, with plans for a central server that can push all the CEMon information into Condor. This "Information Gatherer" is a planned development for the future.

	*  Discovery service 
As part of feedback from Iosif Legrand (MonaLisa developer) and OSG the discovery service is being optimized  and expanded to include more information in the basic web services discovery schema, including arbitrary key/value pairs. The new schema information for developers can be found at http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaewiki/DiscoveryServiceUpdate

This new schema will be used as part of  a new discovery service release sometime this week

optimise publishing of information to ML. Will be part of new discovery service release. Started to take a look at software discovery espeacially for CMS. 

Key/value publication to publish GUMS information, mkgridmap.conf


GIP/BDII for 0.4: Don't have a good idea of what monitoring packages that would be needed at every site. I.e. what the common infrastructure should be. GIP discussion may be a start to provide enough info to run the operations service. No real overlap with ML/ACDC. Unclear that the GIP will provide VO-based job monitoring.

Deployment group writes release description, of what is proposed for deployment. Document doesn't contain a reference to MIS-CI, step backward?

Marko: GIP is a requirement for compatibility with LCG. Only catalog info, no job monitoring.

Will this replace Grid3 schema? answer seem to be "no".

Schema has space, for all the required information, but some information from Grid3 schema not in GIP. No minimum mandatory set in Glue schema.

Interest in the user-vo.txt file. Not part of Grid 3, but GUMS require it. GIP uses that file to do the mapping. The file should be part of the requirements.

Grid3info.conf and user-vo-map should stay, as the locations file in $APP. Make it clear these files are required beyond the Grid3 schema, for GIP.

The files mentioned: GIP tries to leverage the information available. Try not to duplicatem but leverage current information including ML-provided info. Gridcat also provide this information. Seems like all this information is not part of the common infrastructure.

ML is not required in the 0.4 document. Not clear: used to be required.  Changes to existing files, and what should be reuired.

BDII: MDS2 should be deprecated? (question on VDT list) Is MDS2 required for BDII? BDII requires LDAP input from GRIS. BDII auth/no-auth but requires GRIS.

Pupolate BDII without MDS2: MArko thinks it's impossible atm.
Laura: can use MDS4, using XML Glue schema data instead of LDAP. 

Current scripts provide LDIF files. Have to extract XML->LDIF->BDII.  No way to do conversion utility yet. If the schema is know tool should be simple.

GT4 has the GLUE schema in it. GRAM provides information to be converted to XML Glue schema.

MDS4 seems more reliable. Performance: scales well in number of clients, 

BDII in perl 

Deployment meeting about BDII: hierarchical information base GRIS->GRIS_large 

Indexes feed into one another, only translate at higher levels, not on the site (bottom) level. Good for interoperability with other Grids.
