---++ Agenda 
	* GridCat push model discussion
	* AOB
---++ Minutes
	* Attending: Michael, Bockjoo, Anand, John Rosheck

	* Gridcat: push values instead of pulling like it is done now.

	* Michael: next gen catalog, change GridCat collect information from sites. Currently uses MIS-CI scripts to populate sqlite database periodically GOC GridCat server pulls local database info. Would like to consider push model to push data to central catalog or to MonaLisa. This would make integrating the discovery service with GridCat possible. Would not change the user view, only the backend.
	
	* Bockjoo: Originally: MIS-CI provide common infrastructure. Discovery service can probably publish info to ML. Can GridCat poll from ML?
	* Mike:	 Yes, via SOAP interface
	* Conrad: Would info be published via ApMon?
	* Mike: Better to run ML instance at site because it deals better with network issues.
	* (more discussion on technical details)
	* Mike volunteers to make the changes needed
	* Bockjoo: Willing to provide information. Background for GridCat: MDS2 had too many problems, had to switch to running jobs to get information. Happy to use discovery service to provide information from Gridcat.

	* Mike: New architecture would have to run ML, have to become required package in OSG.  Another feature of the new architecture is that publishing is automatic without registering with the GOC. 
  * Bockjoo: would still be some issues with adoption

	* John: Push model better for scalability, doen't see issues with the architecture, but it will be a lot of work. Monalisa shows some gaps, ML redundancy? Questions from Ruth about gaps.

	* Mike: Gaps may mean there were problems with getting the information, e.g. clients lose network connection

	* (some discussion on web pages generated by ML from the OSG ML repository, and information reliability in ML)

	* Mike: thinking of using a model like the discovery service that sends periodic heartbeat information to detect when information becomes stale. Information being published to GridCat doesn't change very often, somewhat like the discovery service

	* Bockjoo: Has to be some monitoring of ML itself to detect when it goes down. How about using MDS4 instead of ML?
	* Conrad: Is MDS4 also distributed?
	* Bockjoo: No, MDS4 is web service based.

	* (Some discussion on MDS4 and ML scalability)

	* Anand: Sees no conflict between MDS4 and the new architecture. GridCat would have to pull information from MDS4.

	* Mike: Will keep in touch with Bockjoo to get more details needed for implementation.

	* Next meeting on Mon, Mar 6, same time
