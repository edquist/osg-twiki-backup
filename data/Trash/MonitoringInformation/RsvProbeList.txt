---+ !RSV Probe List

<p> This twiki page will list information about !RSV probes - both the ones in existence right now, and ones that have been requested by someone on the OSG community.

---++ Current list of probes

<p> Need to fill this up or point somewhere --AG

---++ Requested list of probes (for future work)

---+++ From Steve Timm in osg-int thread [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0805c&L=osg-int&T=0&P=14331][Re: Integrating wn-client on OSG CE installations]]

   * Probably a good idea to add an !RSV probe to check to make sure WN-client is accessible on the head node and that its certs are up to date. 

   * I believe this is related as well -- From Michael Thomas in osg-int thread  [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0805c&L=osg-int&T=0&P=8295][$OSG_GRID on the gatekeeper]]
      * Have an rsv probe for it, or both.  Both my ITB 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 installs were lacking $OSG_GRID on the CE, and it didn't show up as a problem until LIGO tried to validate.
