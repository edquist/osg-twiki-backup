   * TG interoperability
An installtion of OSG/VDT was done on the TeraGrid at Argonne. This mostly went well. Some configuration issues need to be addressed: Gridcat & site-verify assumes the existence of certain files relative to the Globus installation. TG uses a separate Globus installation, so these files needed to be copied and updated manually, which may be unacceptable at many sites.

Bockjoo mentions that there are several ways of obtaining the information provided by the files mentioned above, including an evironment variable, putting the information into MDS. Greg will work with Bockjoo on Gridcat and site-verify to come up with a more acceptable solution. The file Grid3-info.conf also need to be changed.

E.g. MonaLisa: looks at environment, if VDT is there use that, otherwise use the path relative to Globus.

Greg also noted that the MonaLisa installation in the VDT assumes Ganglia instance for collecting some of its information (CPU load, memory...) . Conrad points out that MonaLisa has many ways to gather this information, including snmp and a built-in module.

   * MonaLisa installation requirement on OSG sites. This was discussed at the OctoberTen meeting, where the GOC representative pointed out that an OSG site is not considered up by the GOC if it is not providing Monalisa information. No further discussion this week.

   * Fork job manager is currently a requirement for gathering a lot of monitoring information, which tends to overload the CE.
Bockjoo points out that this can be mitigated by using throttling, but also by more selective use of fork-jobs to gather the information.
Conrad asks whether the information can be requested in a more light-weight manner like from a web service.
