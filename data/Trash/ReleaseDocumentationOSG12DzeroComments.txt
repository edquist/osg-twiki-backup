5 jobs to fgitb-gk.fnal.gov all failed.  3 failed because of file transfer problems which may be due to Samgrid infrastructure problems.  2 failed because:

mkdir: cannot create directory `/local/stage1/samgrid_temp_dir.fgitb124.fnal.gov.24483': Permission denied
mkdir: cannot create directory `/local/stage1/samgrid_temp_dir.fgitb124.fnal.gov.24482': Permission denied

Please fix the permissions and I will retry.

5 jobs to gridtest01.racf.bnl.gov all failed.

7/1 Steve says not to use fgitb-gk.fnal.gov.  Job to gridtest01.racf.bnl.gov failed to store final output file in SAM.  This is most likely a Samgrid infrastructure problem.  I'm retrying.  No word from uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu.  Job to grolsch.lbl.gov.ssb was held.  This is a samgrid infrastructure problem.  I am retrying.  Jobs submitted to cit-itb.ultralight.org on 6/29 still pending.

This may be the same problem as last time when Samgrid software asks for /bin/sh, it really means /bin/bash.  grolsch was/is ubuntu with /bin/sh pointing to /bin/dash not bash.  A ticket was opened to fix this a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed and there is no estimate when it will be fixed.  Last time Keith temporarily had sh point to bash to validate Dzero.  If sh is still dash on grolsch can we play the same game again to finish this?  thanks.

Joel, we had a problem with  grolsch. Everything seems to be working now. Could you try again when you have a chance? Thanks -- keith

Jobs at cit-itb.ultralight.org.ssb have been pending since 6/29.  Can running priority be upped so we can get this finished?  thanks.

No word on authorization problems at  uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu.

Jobs succeeding at uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu.  The site has been validated.  Retrying grolsch.lbl.gov.  The jobs to grolsch failed.  The log files are the same as the last validation when /bin/sh -> /bin/dash, while samgrid software incorrectly assumes /bin/sh -> /bin/bash. The work around is to temporarily let /bin/sh -> /bin/bash for the duration of validation.  For the record the only error indicate din the log files is in stderr:

export: 113: M.: bad variable name

Keith temporarily changed /bin/sh->/bin/bash for the validation.  Jobs successfully completed at grolsch.lbl.gov.
There were some file transfer failures but these are likely due to Samgrid infrastructure difficulties.  The site has been validated.

Dedicated slots have been enabled for ITB validation at CIT.  Dzero jobs are running.
