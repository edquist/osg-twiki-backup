---++ Introduction
This page presents suggestions to write and read short hands-on guides. They are included in the [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][Release Documentation]] but are recognizable by the different style (blue border). They are not reference documents.  They are short guides created initially for the sessions during the August 09 Site Administrators workshop and can be used for tutorials or hands on sessions. The guides used for the workshop are available at SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug09

Notes for users:
   * Guides target is very specific
   * If you need something different you may try to adapt or go to the reference documentation
   * Add comments about your experience, your specific case

Some guidelines for authors:
   * Decide the story: be specific on the content (one release version, one purpose, one cluster configuration)
   * Be brief: only your specific case is covered (but refer more general instructions, see 3)
   * Refer reference documentation: the installation guides are more complete and cover all possibilities. People doing something different should know to go there. Software reference manuals will explain all possible options and uses.
   * Be hands-on: give instructions, add cut and paste friendly content
   * Check the styling guidelines below

---++ Hands on documents
A collection of hans-on tutorials is available at SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug09
Here is an example:
   * Template (useful to start your own guide): TemplateHandsOn
   * Personal client installation: ClientInstallationHandsOn 

---++ Styling guidelines
It is important to maintain some uniformity between the different hands-on guides and with the release documentation. Here are some suggestions:
   * Name your topic as you like, possibly ending with "HandsOn"
   * Use an *Introduction* section where you specify the context of your hands-on document:
      * What it is
      * OSG release it refers to
      * Your setup (machines, operating system) and which other setups are supposed to work
   * Follow with a *Requirements* section where you specify the requirements to do what explained in the document
   * End with a References section where you list some reference documentation. Naturally you are expect to have links also along the document
   * Attach documents that facilitate the hands-on session or are otherwise important: presentations, scripts, supporting data, examples
   * Embed in PDF format any document that you like viewed as presentation (one page at the time, with graphics not available in the wiki):
      * attach the document, a.g. =presentation.pdf=
      * add aline like =&lt;embed src="%<nop>ATTACHURL%/presentation.pdf" width="792" height="612"&gt;=
      * 792x612 is big and clear but may require sctolling on smaller screens, other recommended sizes are 330x255 and 110x85 for thumbnails
   * Use the ="screen"= class for command sequences within the =pre= tag (=&lt;pre class="screen"&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;=)
   * Avoid the user prompt (to ease cut and paste)
<pre class="screen">
echo "Example"
ls
</pre>
   * Include a section for *Comments* at the very end of the page, matching the style of the !ReleaseDocumentation, adding:
<verbatim>
%COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
</verbatim>
   * Terminate the document setting the correct style for the hands-on guides (setting the =USERSTYLEURL= variable, these lines will not appear in the rendering of the document):
<verbatim>
<!--
   * Set USERSTYLEURL = https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/ReleaseDocumentation/HandsOn/centerpageborder.css
-->
</verbatim>

---++Presentation example
Here is an example of how to include a presentation, e.g. the lightning talk of the plenary session.
Attached are both the PDF file (necessary to embed it in the document) and the !PowerPoint file that can be used as template for your presentation:  [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG_SiteAdmin09Aug.ppt][OSG_SiteAdmin09Aug.ppt]]

<embed src="%ATTACHURL%/OSG_SiteAdmin09Aug.pdf" width="792" height="612">
