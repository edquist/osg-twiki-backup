A new version of the CE Install instructions to replace the configuring PKI section of 
Trash/Integration.OSGCEInstallGuide.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
The twiki path shows this page under PpdgScriptsMyproxy and I don't think it should be there and can
be moved up a level.

Actually, I am not sure this page is needed at all. There isn't a need to configure the CA anymore and
I thought there was another example
of requesting a host certificate.
I think we need to look at the pages referring to this one and see if they should refer to another.

The Backlinks at the bottom of the page shows no links to here, so lets delete it.

---++Configure the Public Key Infrastructure
Minimally, you will need a host certificate and private key to identify your CE.

I think this section is not needed and can be removed.

Configure the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA) to be used by default by running the utility below. 
<I>If there is an option "<b>choose the option
 which matches "1c3f2ca8 : ...</b>", then enter "<b>q</b>" at the prompts.</I>  ( %RED% have to add =--ca=1c3f2ca8= on command line. - from Alan Sill; Alain Roy: fixed in VDT 1.3.8 %ENDCOLOR%)

A <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.5/certificate_authorities.html">list of CAs</a> were added as authorized CAs on your system. Please review the list of authorized CAs and modify the set in /etc/grid-security/certificates as needed to match your local policy.  

The daemon <b>edg-crl-upgrade</b> should be running at all times in the background to refresh the CRLs from these CAs.  If CRLs are not kept current, incoming connections will fail. 
To check that it's running:

<pre> <b>
> ps axwww | grep edg-crl-upgrade
</b></pre>

If not running, do

<pre> <b>
> /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded start
</b></pre>


The [[Trash.Trash/IntegrationCertScripts][PPDG-Cert-Scripts]] package in can assist you with choosing Certificate Authorities to trust and and periodically checking that the CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) have not expired.

---+++ Request and Install Host Certificate
After the pacman installation of the CE software completes you should have the PPDG-Cert-Scripts  package installed (in $VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts) and the instructions below show the use of those scripts.
To authorize this resource for use, a host certificate needs to be obtained from an appropriate Certificate Authority. Currently the 
<a href="http://www.doegrids.org"> DOEGrids CA </a>is the most common CA in use for OSG participants.
iVDGL and PPDG project instructions for getting a certificate are available on the <a href="http://igoc.ivdgl.indiana.edu/RAinfo/newra/">iVDGL RA</a> and <a href="http://www.ppdg.net/RA">PPDG RA</a> sites (RA is Registration Authority). 
    
Here is a brief guide to the process assuming you have a valid User Certificate. 
 
   * Run cert-request to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.

Your Certificate Request has been successfully submitted
Your Certificate Request id: 2005

        You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate
        has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your
        certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</pre>

After the certificate is approved you will receive an email which includes the serial number of the new certificate.  Use that serial number to retrieve the certificate and move it to the installation directory.

<pre>
&gt; <b>%GREEN%cert-retrieve -dir . -certnum 0x299%ENDCOLOR%</b>

&gt; <b>%GREEN%mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem%ENDCOLOR%</b>
&gt; <b>%GREEN%chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem%ENDCOLOR%</b>
&gt; <b>%GREEN%chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem%ENDCOLOR%</b>
</pre>


The following command will verify the certificate is readable.
<pre>&gt; <b>%GREEN%openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem%ENDCOLOR%</b>
</pre>
The output is something like:
<pre>

---+++ Get an LDAP service certificate to run authenticated MDS (optional)
MDS is the Monitoring and Directory Service. The GRIS (Grid Resource Info Service, a sensor that collects site data and publishes it to MDS) is configured to allow only authenticated and authorized access. Access requires an LDAP service certificate (two files), owned by the MDS owner (if you installed as root, the owner is probably daemon -- check).
        <pre>
&gt; <b>%GREEN%source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh%ENDCOLOR%</b>
&gt; <b>%GREEN%cert-request -ou s -dir . -host <i>hostname.domain.tld</i> -service ldap%ENDCOLOR%</b></pre>
And follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating <b>ldapkey.pem</b> and <b>ldapcert.pem</b>. More info on service certificates can be found at <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.9/installation_post.html#servicecert">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.9/installation_post.html#servicecert</a>
