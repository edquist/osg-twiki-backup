---++ Overview

For this demo we will be using Povray, which is a raytracer used to create three-dimensional graphics. A scene (including objects, textures, lights, cameras, ...) is described in a scene description language, and Povray then follow the light rays and creates a image with shadows, transparency and so on. This final output we are going to do in this demo is an image of a Bonsai tree:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/rendered.png" alt="rendered.png" width='400' height='300' />


Running Povray can be pretty compute intensive. Ho intensive depends on scene complexity and output size of the image. Running on a grid like OSG, one of the things you will have to do is break your problem up into sub problems. For our rendering problem, we will split the task of rendering the full image up into the problems of rendering tiles of the image, and then when we have all the tiles, we will put the tiles together into the final image. How many tiles you want to do is a user setting, but one possible break down would be 8x6 (48 tiles).

The way to describe a set of jobs in OSGMM is as a [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v7.2/2_10DAGMan_Applications.html][Condor DAGMan]]. The normal use case for DAGMans is that you have job dependencies, but in the case of rendering Povray tiles, the jobs are fully independent (you can render each tile without knowing what is going on with the neighboring tiles). But there are other advantages with DAGMan. It has hooks for pre/post scripts than can run locally before and after a job, and if case of job failures, DAGMan can resubmit the job. The steps necessary to create a workflow is:

   * for each tile, create a Condor submit file to describe the job and pass the needed parameters to the job
   * add all the Condor jobs to the DAGMan
   * submit the DAGMan
