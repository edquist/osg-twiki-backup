---++ Myproxy in VDT

Myproxy is included in [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu][VDT]], and uses 
[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/installation_pacman.html][pacman]] 
for download & installation.

To install myproxy (client & server) from VDT 1.3.6, you first install pacman (see above)
and then install myproxy as
<pre>
cd /install/path	# whatever location you want myproxy installed into
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_136_cache:Myproxy
</pre>
To use other versions of VDT see the main VDT documentation for the correct cache URL.
This install process will look much like that [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/installation_install.html][shown for VDT]]
except only those things needed ofr Myproxy are installed rather than the whole VDT.
This will put myproxy in /etc/rc.d/init.d.
The myproxy server configuration file is /install/path/globus/etc/myproxy-server.config.

Set up the path/environment for the client tools, source /install/path/setup.sh.
