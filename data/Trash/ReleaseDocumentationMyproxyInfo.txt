---++ Myproxy in VDT

Myproxy is included in [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu][VDT]], and uses 
[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/installation_pacman.html][pacman]] 
for download & installation.

To install myproxy (client & server) from VDT 1.3.6, you first install pacman (see above)
and then install myproxy as
<pre>
cd /install/path	# whatever location you want myproxy installed into
pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_136_cache:Myproxy
</pre>
To use other versions of VDT see the main VDT documentation for the correct cache URL.
This install process will look much like that [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.8/installation_install.html][shown for VDT]]
except only those things needed ofr Myproxy are installed rather than the whole VDT.
This will put myproxy in /etc/rc.d/init.d.
The myproxy server configuration file is /install/path/globus/etc/myproxy-server.config.

Set up the path/environment for the client tools, source /install/path/setup.sh.

---++ Use Cases
---+++ Roaming User
	1. User has long term private key on personal desktop/laptop computer.
	2. User uploads medium-term proxy to myproxy server every Monday morning (myproxy-init), from his/her desktop/laptop.
	3. User retrieves delegated proxy from server anytime & anyplace a proxy is needed.  myproxy client tools must be available at that "anyplace" but nothing else is required (no long-term private key)

Issues:
	* account management on myproxy server
	* publication of supported modes of operation
	* policy on lifetime of stored credentials

---+++ Renewing credentials for long running jobs
See [[http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~jbasney/proxy-renewal.pdf][reference paper]] by Kouril & Basney.
	* Same as Roaming User plus:
	4. User submits grid job with retrieved proxy credential via condor-g, giving condor-g some config info about the myproxy server
	5. condor-g gets an updated proxy from the myproxy server before the original proxy credential expires.

Issues:
	* In addition to Roaming User:
	* document how it works and how to use it in OSG case
		* OSG case means many different people doing submission, there is not a single, or single type of WMS (workload management system) but there is a OSG recommendation to use condor-g as a layer in job submission
