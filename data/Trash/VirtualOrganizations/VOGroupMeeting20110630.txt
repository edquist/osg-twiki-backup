---++ Announcements

The 2011 OSG Summer workshop will be in Lubbock, TX on August 9 and 10 (informal sessions in the afternoon), followed by the CMS Tier 3 workshop on August 10 and 11.  If interested, in having other VOs or interest group meetings on the 10 and 11, Alan Sill, can make space available.

Here are link to indico and a planning page:

---+++ Community Packaging (transition from Pacman to native packaging) -  Alain Roy

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/CommunityPackagingProposal][Overview of Community Packaging Approach]]
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/NPTransition][Native Packaging Transition]] (draft)
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/RPMDevelopmentGuide][VDT RPM Development Guide]] (draft)


---+++ GLOW - Dan Bradley

   * current usage, general status, and issues
      * Often using over 10k hours per day.  Thanks OSG!
      * Typically running a few hundred jobs on OSG, peak around 2000.
      * Usage of GLOW resources by other OSG members tends to be dominated by CMS and ATLAS (also IceCube), who own many resources in GLOW.  Other OSG VOs have used about 350k hours so far in 2011.
      * Currently not running on sites that require glexec, just to keep things simple.
      * Using glideinWMS (UCSD glidein factory) has helped make OSG look like Condor to our users.  This has made OSG much more accessible to our community.
      * Main work is getting user's software packaged for OSG (Matlab, R, python packages, etc.)
      * Some problems with job memory requirements.

  * science that is being accomplished
     * Quantum Computing (Susan Coppersmith)
     * Study of seedling growth and development (Edgar Spalding)
     * Identifying genes and pathways involved in obesity-induced type 2 diabetes, in the mouse (Alan Attie)
     * Many other potential science users from University of Wisconsin

   * plans for the next few months (how you use OSG and changes inside the VO)
      * Make glideins advertise a better estimate of available memory.  (Working with glideinWMS folks.)
      * Make more of our users OSG-capable.  This is still a one-on-one process for us.

   * concerns and possible obstacles to implementing this roadmap
      * Some users have jobs that don't pass our checklist for jobs easily run on OSG: run for few hours, max ~1.5GB RAM, not much data movement.  We would, of course, like to start tackling some of the less easy cases.


---+++ !SBGrid - Ian Stokes-Rees

   * current usage, general status, and issues
      * operationally things are going well.  A few permission problems with UCSD (no response on ticket one week later) [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=10612][#10612]].
      * we have jobs accounted as "SBGrid" and "sbgrid" - why? sbgrid
      * we ran 12k jobs last week (externally), requiring 33.6k wall-hours, but running at only 48% efficiency. THIS IS BAD!  Our jobs should be at >80% efficiency.  They are almost entirely computationally bound.
      * one of our clusters is sick (SBGrid-Harvard-East), and as it consists of 1.4 GHz AMD Opterons probably won't be revived if the CE looses its pulse.  It is small and only contributes a couple thousand hours of compute time/week in any case.
      * looks like QWCG-Harvard-OSG has been taken offline (maybe since early June), but if so it is news to me.  Maybe it just isn't running jobs or reporting them.
      * 4000 job peak at end of May, but usually we've been around 1000-1500 jobs.
      * glideinWMS Gratia probes should be installed soon.  Held up due to staffing shortages/changes and flux in responsibilities for OSG admin tasks.
      * we need accounting to split out real user utilization and success/failure, rather than clumping them all as frontend/glidein.nebiogrid.org
      * we're concerned about glideinWMS idle jobs and evictions which we get v. limited view of.

   * science that is being accomplished
      * X-ray structure determination by Wide Search Molecular Replacement portal
      * NMR model optimization by DEN refinement via portal
      * lung cancer drug delivery modelling

   * plans for the next few months (how you use OSG and changes inside the VO)
      * Getting Harvard Medical School 4000-job slot cluster connected (in or out) to OSG is still in progress.  Problems with network topology and firewall are hindering progress.

   * concerns and possible obstacles to implementing this roadmap
      * Condor, Globus, and OSG don't like NAT or firewalls.  They are a reality for us here.
      * We still struggle with X.509 certs for users, but are just about there with a fully-wrapped system that will mean users don't need them to use OSG.
      * glideinWMS is still too much of a blackbox for my liking.
      * why are we getting such low efficiency?

   * requirements for new OSG capabilities
      * data ACLs are important for us.  Knowing how this can work with SRM and BeStMan now and in the near future would be helpful.
      * user management is a big deal: VOMS does one side, GUMS another, and (for us) LDAP/FreeIPA a third.  Convergence of these would be great.  I assume that isn't going to happen, so just some good guidance on how to set things up quickly and easily and then to manage this system operationally would be really helpful.
      * user-driven sub-VOs (dynamic VOs) would be really helpful.
