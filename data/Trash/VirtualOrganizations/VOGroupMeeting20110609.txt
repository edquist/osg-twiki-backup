---++ Announcements

We are beginning our annual report to NSF; Jemise is asking !VOs for scientific publications that used OSG. Contact jemise at fnal dot gov.

Dan Fraser sent an email to list to explain how packaging strategy for VPN will transitioning from PacMan to RPM. Alain Roy will be available to answer questions at this forum on June 30.

VO package out on Tuesday: JDEM VO removed; addition of National Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES). 

Any VO that's running !GlideinWMS, we encourage you to work with Derek to get this probe installed and give us feedback; this will be a great help to !VOs to understand accounting.
!GlideinWMS Monitoring graphs are now on the UNL gratia pages: [[http://red-web.unl.edu/gratia/xml][http://red-web.unl.edu/gratia/xml]]
Can filter on many aspects of usage. (More work to be done--three more graphs planned.)

Q: any particular version of Glidein or Condor needed? 
A: [[http://koji.hep.caltech.edu/public/packages/gratia-probe/1.07.02e/0.4.pre/noarch/gratia-probe-condor-1.07.02e-0.4.pre.noarch.rpm][RPM]] with [[Accounting.ProbeConfigGlideinWMS][instructions]]


Under the heading Glidein Bar Graphs.

---++  VOs In Focus 

 

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Nothing to report.


---+++ Fermilab VO (Steve Timm)

Unexpected power outage 2/3 of production computing on Tuesday caused all machines to be down for about an hour; some machines remained at reduced capacity. Everything is back up at full capacity as of this morning. 


---+++ !SURAGrid (John-Paul Robinson)

Update: one new system (Brazos) is now available on SURAGrid avaiable to accept job from !SURAGrid users. U Central Florida is now working on getting resources online (so four in the hopper, three out the door).



---++ AOB


Update on the Submission machine from RENCI from Marko and Gabriele: NEES user has to transfer a large amount (over 1 GB per job) and getting from worker node back to submit host; having problems getting from submit host back to PC. Using file transfer 
Globus online worked okay, but not getting a high transfer rate. UCSD and RENCI network specialists identified faulty cables at RENCI. Now have higher transfer. Still other bottlenecks, but will taone step at a time.
