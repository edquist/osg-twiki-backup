---+++ !GlueX - Richard Jones

10 insitutions and 40 scientists; Jefferson lab is the nucleus for this activity

First physics in 2015 and full intensity in 2017

9000 cores needed in 2017; 1000 cores need in 2015

Current site has 400 cores; providing access to other VOs; see 
http://red-web.unl.edu/gratia/byvo?facility=Uconn-OSG_CE

On the user side, there are 3 users  and will grow to about 30 eventually

Fully adopted glideinWMS using OSG factory at UCSD

The major challenge is getting the application to run at other sites (* of them) due to software environment diversity; for current target sites see 
http://red-web.unl.edu/gratia/vo?vo=gluex

Installation of dCache at UConn was a challenge and continues to require effort
