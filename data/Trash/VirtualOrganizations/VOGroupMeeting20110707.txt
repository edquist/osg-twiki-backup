---+++ Engage - John !McGee

successfully running with GlideinWMS, has made a significant impact in throughput. In general, all “normal” serial jobs run with no waiting. We are seeing an increasing trend toward non-normal jobs, especially larger memory requirements, but also other hybrids such as htpc and gpgpu. RENCI Blue Ridge resource servicing about 50 jobs at a time non-stop, currently governed to 50 jobs by SDSC factory at our request, have internal meetings planned to investigate local policies that may allow for more backfill and more cycles for OSG. Mats has recently deployed the new Gratia probes to re-enable per user accounting, and has been working with Derek and blueprint team to ensure against double counting.

Rosetta still in pilot mode, molecular dynamics (Perisnotti), support for NEES (Barbosa), nuclear physics (Bass et al), more physics (Vish at Caltech).

no major changes planned within the next couple of months. Potential repeat of the UW/Rosetta model with VBI, flocking their Condor pool into Engage.

We continue to see increased demands for larger memory nodes, not critical at this point, but throughput is not equivalent



---+++ !SURAGrid - John Paul Robinson

SURAgrid has two resources online at TTU (antaeus.hpcc.ttu.edu)and TAMU (hurr.tamu.edu).  Resources additions are in planning for UGA and UAB and expected by mid-August.

A wiki has been established to maintain end user documentation and system admin documentation (http://docs.uabgrid.uab.edu/suragrid).  This is a new resource for SURAgrid that we hope will serve the ability to share steps and requirements for bringing applications online.

There is interest in running computational chemistry jobs, bioinformatics, and other workflows, however, there are currently no major applications from SURAgrid running on OSG.  We are still in the process of recruiting several candidate applications at our own sites. 
Some have been identified but recruitment continues to be a slow process hampered by human resource requirements within both the campus science teams and cluster support teams.

Among the resources that may be beneficial are ready made VMs that could be run with the software ready to submit jobs to resources within SURAgrid and/or to front-end a cluster as a compute element.  We have at times tested this concept in SURAgrid but have not had significant uptake.
