---+++ Engage - John !McGee


successfully running with GlideinWMS, has made a significant impact in throughput. In general, all “normal” serial jobs run with no waiting. We are seeing an increasing trend toward non-normal jobs, especially larger memory requirements, but also other hybrids such as htpc and gpgpu. RENCI Blue Ridge resource servicing about 50 jobs at a time non-stop, currently governed to 50 jobs by SDSC factory at our request, have internal meetings planned to investigate local policies that may allow for more backfill and more cycles for OSG. Mats has recently deployed the new Gratia probes to re-enable per user accounting, and has been working with Derek and blueprint team to ensure against double counting.

Rosetta still in pilot mode, molecular dynamics (Perisnotti), support for NEES (Barbosa), nuclear physics (Bass et al), more physics (Vish at Caltech).

no major changes planned within the next couple of months. Potential repeat of the UW/Rosetta model with VBI, flocking their Condor pool into Engage.

We continue to see increased demands for larger memory nodes, not critical at this point, but throughput is not equivalent
