---++ %BLACK% VOs In Focus %ENDCOLOR%

---++ !CompBioGrid 

Not present.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Set a peak record of16.4 M events. Jobs running at !UConn. Richard Jones asked if Joel knows why SamGrid jobs are going into a hole on his condor.

Joel has been working on VO plans and requirements and is waiting for Brad Abbott to review.

---++ !Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Testing SL4/5 split cluster, should have document ready soon. Other FermiGrid VOs may find increased documentation.
!NuMI !sub-VO active again after a long hiatus; LBNE also starting to run jobs.
Accelerator group ramping down. They will have a new publication out soon.

---++ Engagement  (Gabriele Garzoglio & Derek Weitzel)

Currently helping with OSG Engagement while G hires replacement for Chris Green. Strapped for people. Two main activies: 

GEANT-4 validation: engaging community for more than 1 year. Successfully running validation jobs for new release. Will do this now, then again in December. ~20 sites running on OSG. Use !MatchMaker, but for this particular release, are seeing errors on one site. Abhishek has been in touch with !GEANT-4 spokesperson John Apolistakis, who will send an updated stakeholder document. Gabriele is wondering whether GEANT-4 has some effort they can put it on their side for the December run, although they expect to have a replacement.

LCSD simulation - considering running simulations on OSG.   

---++ !GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

VO side-production: Worked with Joel Snow at D0 and confirmed that environmental variable making jobs crash. Success!

Opportunistic storage: D0 asked for increase. Engage: opened ticket. Richard upgraded software and should be working.

Help from OSG Security in getting answers for Jlab. Richard working on summary document of mechanisms used.

Has a !DOEGrids voucher for approving personal certificate requests.Doug Olson stated that OSG works with !DOEGrids CA. Vetting process managed through !VOs. Since !GLUE-X is in the process of getting set up and there was some confusion that !JLab was handling requests for !GLUE-X. We can arrange for someone else from !GLUE-X to approve. Doug will work with Richard offline to arrange.

Marco said that we should have a document of recognized CAs and a reference contact. 
Robert Engel mentions that the information is dynamic. Doug says there is some documentation, but it doesn't contain anything more than a list at software.grid.iu.edu. This information is not linked from user guide process.
Marco will look into this from user certificate documentation. This item will be added to the Documentation Item agenda.



---++ SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Running well with !GlideInWMS. Doing some CPU reconfiguration to optimize stability and have a better development environment. Running about 2600 jobs on grid running steady for several days this week and last.

Derek asked whether Ian submitted a large batch of jobs at once. Number of idle jobs constantly changing and worried that schedd can't keep up with all the condor submits that !DagMan is doing. Peter set condor variable for max condor jobs at 1000, so that may be putting load on schedd. Jobs running for ~20 minutes. Jobs last week ~5 weeks. !DagMan couldn't submit jobs as fast as jobs finished. Condor 7.5.3 has improved a lot of the scalability with no problems noticed.

Abhishek asked whether there has been a change in numbers 20 sites with peak of 5000 jobs. Peak of 100K wall hours on June 24. Yes. Fermilab is not currently submitting tier-1 pilot jobs from UCSD because of a glexec issue. Fixing this is a high priority. GOC ticket number: 8845. This should not have impact on !SBGrid.

Would be nice to have more sites to help load balance in case of situations like this, but for now, things going well.

---++ AOB

Jim Weichel - Nothing to report.

Robert Engel - Nothing to report. Abhishek reports that documentation on VOMS and VOMRS will be addressed by Richard Jones. Still looking for someone for GUMS. There are high-priority items that may require some additional time. Target date: end of July.
