 [[VOGroupMeeting20100211][Weekly Forum: February 11]] 

---++ Announcements 

Power outage at Fermilab Wednesday,February 17; affected production for CDF, D0, CMS, etc.

Synopsis regarding opportunistic storage in coming weeks from Security group following last week's blueprint meeting.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Release of a new IGTF CA certificates Tuesday, but defect in signing policy file from one of Euro sites; errors reported to IGTF package; New release (1.13) going out today. 

Mine organizing 1/2 day session at All Hands (Monday 8:30-11:30 am) to talk about VOs and Security as follow up to management workshop in November.

---++ Storage

---++ Communications 

---++ VOs in focus 


---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

CERN visit as setting up Tier center. Now ready to crank up again. Testbed set up and functional. VOMS server. H/W scheduled for March 1st, then will run scaling tests with OSG interface.

Last summer, not able to identify problem with interface. (occured when spike in # jobs to gatekeeper). First task is to look into.


---+++ CDF (Joe Boyd)

FNAL power outage: Back up after all-clear.


---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

power outage. back up today. Joel is having conversations with UTA regarding using storage.


---+++ !Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Grid head nodes up quickly after outage. Production starting to resume; integration still offline. Running at reduced power capacity; Worker nodes not affected. 

New !sub-VO coming on board next week: Muon Accelerator program.

---+++ !GlueEX (Richard Jones)

Continue running jobs locally through OSG; Jobs from offsite not running. Working w/ experts. One generic Unix uid mapped to all external VOs is a problem. OSG standard is one to one, but making all separate uids is cumbersome. This is not obvious in the documentation. Doug Olson will follow up.

site name: uconn-osg;  384 cores, 1/3 used by local users with top priority; a couple TBs of storage. D0 will send test jobs; can use some storage also. NYSGrid will ask users to take a look. 


---+++ !GridUNESP (Rogerio Iope)

Working on problem with local switch in main cluster which caused problems with LIGO jobs. Working with vendor.

Central cluster at Sao Paulo: 
* 256 workers: dual quad-core Xeon Harpertown 2.83GHz, 16 GB mem, 1 x 73 GB SAS disk plus additional equipment.
* 7 Secondary clusters, widely distributed on different UNESP campuses.
* substantial networking connectivity to multiple sites.

---+++ !nanoHUB

Not present.

---+++ !NYSGrid (Steve Gallo)

Looking to upgrade current infrastructure over the summer from 13TF to 40-60TF. Made progress in standing up various hubs with HubZero and getting access through hub to blue gene resources at Stonybrook.
