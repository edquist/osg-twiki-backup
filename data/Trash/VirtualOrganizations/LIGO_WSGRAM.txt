<br>Subject: WS-GRAM Mtg Minutes: Apr 28 & May 5
<br>
Dear all,

below please find summarized the minutes for both telecons.

Regards, Britta


1) Attendance
 -- Kent, Warren, Abhishek, Stu, Thomas, Terrence, Suchandra, Jeff, Jaime, Britta

2) Current status:WS-GRAM in the Inspiral Group
 -- Tested six sites (OSG 0.6.0 ?) , three successful: OSG_LIGO_MIT, BNL_ATLAS_1,     -- FNAL_GPFARM

3) Current status:WS-GRAM in the Pulsar Group; E@OSG, E@Home's use  of WS-GRAM
 -- Thomas runs E@OSG successfully at 5 OSG sites: BNL_ATLAS_1, UWMilwaukee,
Nebraska, TTU_ANTAEUS, AGLT2
 -- globus job status error: after increase of idle-timeout-limit to 2 mins and using absolute rather t
     than       relative life times no further errors were observed, GOC ticket closed
 -- the relative timeout bug is fixed in Globus 4.0.5

4) Description of how E@H jobs are submitted and controlled on grids including job deletion
 -- E@OSG  jobs are not  deleted explicitly by the user and hence, a server overload should         not occur
 -- max run time of a job is currently set to 48hrs, should be reduced to 12hrs
 --new jobs are automatically submitted when the # of running jobs falls below a certain threshold

5) Condor Throttle to prevent server overload, GRAM 4.2 support in Condor
 -- has been implemented by Jaime
 -- LIGO work-flow  WS-GRAM submission via Condor_G to be tested with this throttle
     (Britta)

6) Stress testing WS-GRAM in GT 4.0.7, production site selection  within OSG
  --  Stresss testing at UCSD to begin  Mid June  (Britta)

7) Stress testing WS-GRAM in GT 4.2, Validation Testbed
 -- VTB will not be ready for testing in the near future

8) Future plans for WS-GRAM use within LIGO
 -- Britta to take over E@OSG runs and expand resource pool

9) AOB
 -- Gratia reporting: Britta to asked Chris Green for access to failure rates/ origins statistics for
     future monitoring
 --Thomas to send Britta E@OSG documentation/statistics
 -- E@OSG ducumentation to be posted on DASWG pages (Britta needs user name and
     password--> Warren)
 -- E@OSG documentation within OSG-USER  pages (?)
 -- follow-up meeting in 4-6 weeks

<br>Subject: Re: WS-GRAM Mtg to discuss LIGO use cases (Apr 28 Minutes)
<br>
Dear all - 

We had a very productive meeting. Thanks to everyone who attended, and 
our sincere gratitude to Chander for providing direction and for 
leading us all to get together. Here is a brief summary -

Attending: Chander, Kent, Stu, Suchandra, Jeff, Terrence, Abhishek

Jeff and Terrence gave an overview of work done by OSG teams for 
WS-GRAM validation. A detailed outline is at - 
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Integration/WSGramValidation

It was discussed how WS-GRAM in GT 4.0.7, which is part of OSG 1.0, is 
in need of further improvement. Overloading of server by large-scale 
client job removal is of main concern, since this either requires 
client-side awareness and throttling or otherwise deployment on fewer 
sites. Jamie is understood to be working on a Condor-G workaround, 
alongwith Stu, but it may only be ready after OSG 1.0 public release.

Stu mentioned how WS-GRAM in GT 4.2 will solve this problem. This may 
only be ready in time for a OSG 1.0.x subrelease, or perhaps OSG 1.2. 
Chander advised that inclusion of the same in VDT as well as its 
validation/integration and site deployment are broader areas within 
OSG technology lifecycle - we decided that Alain and Rob G's decisions 
are important here, and postponed the discussion to a later date.

Stu requested for more information from Britta and LIGO's D-Grid 
collaborators, on Einstein@Home's use of WS-GRAM. This will help 
better understand if, and how, Einstein@Home's use case may or may not 
trigger the overload problem.

Suchandra and Jeff agreed that although WS-GRAM in GT 4.0.7 may be 
enabled on many OSG 1.0 sites, we should ensure that power users as 
LIGO target only select and known sites to stress-test them heavily.

Suchandra, Jeff, Abhishek pointed out that a reasonable approach 
forward would be to have two parallel paths of WS-GRAM deployment and 
usage - (a) Select sites in production, e.g., UCSD, UNL, FermiGrid; 
(b) Validation Testbed to start evaluating forthcoming GT 4.2.

Lastly but most importantly - Terrence has offered UCSD production 
site for LIGO to stress-test with Einstein@Home jobs. In addition, 
Terrence mentioned a plan to bring up a validation CE later on, with 
rapid deployment of GT 4.2 series, for both VTB as well as LIGO to 
continue to evaluate. This may help set a good pace for LIGO's GT 4.2 
adoption, in the next 6 months timeline, prior to ITB 1.1 / OSG 1.2.

We welcome Britta to identify a good day/time with D-Grid team, and to 
take lead and decide on the agenda for the next week's meeting.

Thanks again, everyone!

regards,
Abhishek
