---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from previous meetings

   * Chris forgot to ask Abhishek to put a validation update into the minutes last week. 

---++++ Action

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

   * Mats: Created a little work-flow to handle WRF/MPI on Purdue-Lear. Seems to work OK, will continue to liaise with Purdue.

---++++ Action

---+++ AOB

   * Chris: Presented user issues to EB and talked about =osg-vo-tests= status. Had to chop and change presentation due to requirements for discussion during items. One item in particular was suspension and preemption. Chris was able to obtain agreement in principle for sites which preempt to advertise that they do in such a way as to allow users to test in requirements, but this may not be possible technically in all situations.
      * Britta: am looking at =osg-vo-tests=, will probably use it.

   * Britta: looking at running Einstein at Home on the grid for LIGO. Looking at whether to run under BOINC or separately.
      * Mats: Rosetta has two compile modes: integrate into BOINC or build standalone, which is how it is used on OSG.
      * Chris: Depends to a large extent on size of work units; how to deal with preemption: check-pointing, abandonment, etc.
