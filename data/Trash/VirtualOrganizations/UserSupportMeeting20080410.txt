---++ Status of Pending Action Items
   * [CG] From All Hands meeting - make matrix of VO vs Site from VO tests "hello world" execution.

The template files are on the security twiki page (policies and procedures table.) they are also uploaded to doc db #751 and 753. We almost finished updating VO contact lists and are currently waiting for OIM project to finish so that we can give a copy of our list to the database.
