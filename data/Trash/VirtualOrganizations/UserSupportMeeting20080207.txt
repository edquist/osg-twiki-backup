---++ Agenda

---+++ MPI resource provisioning: Changes to !ReSS, GIP custom attributes, usage by Engage team. 

Gabriele presented a summary of changes that have been made in !ReSS to facilitate provisioning (advertisement/discovery) of MPI resources.

*How to add custom attributes to GIP*

The GIP developers provide new documentation on how on the OSG twiki:

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders#How_do_I_get_my_GIP_to_publish_n

*FermiGrid custom attributes*

Gabriele has talked to Neha Sharma, of !FermiGrid. !FermiGrid is the Fermilab campus grid. Its clusters publish custom attributes to the !FermiGrid !ReSS server. All !FermiGrid custom attributes are statically defined.

!FermiGrid has 2 use cases:

1) Advertise a WS-GRAM interface. !FermiGrid uses a custom attribute, in the context of a CE, to advertise the type of interface (GT4) and the GRAM url.
(This can be great input for the information interoperability discussion, where people want to accomplish  the same thing for the OSG)

2) a !GlobusRSL string that specifies the appropriate constraints to the local scheduler, in order to send the job to the subcluster selected via !ReSS.

Neha mentioned 2 caveats:

1) a VDT upgrade will erase your modified GIP configuration. Maintain a back up of your files.

2) if you have a condor cluster, the default GIP configuration published 1 CE per VO. If you want your custom attribute to be available for all VOs, you
have to list the attribute in the context of about 50 CE.

*When can we start using custom attributes?*

Until very recently, custom attributes site would jeopardize the information sent by that site to the EGEE information bridge. DBII checks for compliance
of the information with the Glue Schema.

Indiana University has now developed a information aggregator, which filters out any attribute not compliant with the glue schema, before sending the
information to DBII. Effectively, this allows custom information in !ReSS, without breaking DBII interoperability with EGEE.

Tim Silver has deployed the system on the ITB. Before deploying it to the OSG, Tim is waiting to discuss related features of the system (information
expiration time) at the info interoperability meeting, next Wed.

*What attributes did we decide to use for MPI ?*

There have been 2 proposals:

1) Use Custom (non Glue Schema compliant) attributes. This can be tried immediately after the new Aggregator is deployed at Indiana for OSG production.

2) Use the Software entity of the Glue Schema. The current CEMon does not publish Software information. With OSG v1.0.0 (May 1), the new CEMon will. For
your planning, consider that sites often do not promptly upgrade to the latest software stack.

---+++ Bio Applications workshop at OSG All-hands meeting.

Maxim and Mats are in communication with Biology application teams.

---+++ Meeting schedule change.

   * Meeting schedule needs to be changed to avoid clashing with area coordinators' meeting every second Thursday at 11.30AM CT. 
   * New timeslot for the weekly User Group meeting to be 1:30 CT Thursdays.

---+++ Area Coordinators' meeting.

   * Need to discuss points for presentation at the UG meeting prior to the AC meeting.
   * Chris and Abhishek to discuss this via email.
   * Next AC presentation from UG coordinators will be 2008/02/14.

---+++ Representation at integration meeting.

   * Britta has started to represent User Group at the weekly Integration meetings.

---+++ LIGO workflow troubleshooting

   * Progress beign made. 
   * Britta is in communication with OSG GOC and Troubleshooting teams. Kent and Abhishek are on cc list of GOC tickets. 
   * Ticket numbers are: 4478, 4479, 4480.
