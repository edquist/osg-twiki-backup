Security (Mine Atunay)

Question for site admins: Do security announcements and mitigation recommendations that are sent make sense?  Please tell tg-security, osg-security, or Mine directly (maltunay at fnal dot gov). 

The security team sends only high-level issues. There are other lists for medium-level issues and more details.

---++ VOs In Focus 

---+++ KISTI  


Gabriele went to KISTI, the Korean Supercomputing Center. Fermilab's connection with KISTI is that it is (1) an OSG site and (2) CDF is having trouble running their production jobs there. Gabriele wanted to find out about the site's level of maturity, infrastructure, etc.

KISTI management is interested in being a stronger player for OSG. They also run on EGI, supporting mainly ATLAS.

Overall, there is strong support from the team, from the manager of the data hub and from the director of KISTI. The site is young (3 yrs),however, and can improve the quality of its operational processes. There are not many formalized processes and procedures, but team is very interested in developing these, particularly SLAs, escalation for incidents, problem mgmt and change mgmt. 

The team tentatively agreed for one member to go to Fermilab for a term of about 6 months in summer to work on a  Fermilab project and to learn how Fermilab does operates. 


Gabriele also talked with them about allowing jobs from the !Fermi-VO and Engagement VO. Gabriele talked to them about writing an SLA.

The problems with pbs do not have a clear root cause. There seems to have been a problem with the pbs database, possibly related to adding new nodes to the server. Shutting down and re-initializing the database seems to have fixed the problem. 

CDF (Rick St. Denis) reported via email on Oct. 27 that "CDF is running production (just started today) and we are investigating ways to speed up the tranfers back. Takes 1.5h to run and 3.5h to copy back but we can do much better with parallel copies. The output files from production add up to about the same as input, but they are each smaller so transfer faster if we do them in parallel."



---+++  FERMI-VO (Steve Timm)

KISTI did work on opening up to Fermilab VO. Testing is in progress. 




---+++  GROW (Daniel Squires)

Daniel is in Computer Science at the University of Iowa and is now on board to help with GROW. Currently working on getting buffer up and running; trying to get servers working. Iowa just purchased a new 50TB storage server and three head nodes. Additional servers will be purchased in March, pending funding. 


---+++ Richard Jones (GLUE-X)

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9142][GOC Ticket #9142]] still open; no progress. Many were involved with CHEP  last week. !UConn been using SE heavily and it work fine, so this seems to be a D0-specific problem.

Production: Richard fixed an issue traced to a corruption in a journal file; a restart has corrected the problem. Slowness in response time still exists.  

Glue-X production ramping up. Currently, GLUE-X is only doing production on the !UConn site; however, they would like to expand their sites. Richard will work with Igor on getting !glideinWMS working, then will request more sites.
