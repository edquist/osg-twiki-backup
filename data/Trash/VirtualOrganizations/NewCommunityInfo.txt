The Open Science Grid (OSG) is a consortium of research communities who promote science via sharing of computing resources.  We enable a framework of distributed computing and storage resources, a set of services and methods that enable better access to ever increasing computing resources for researchers and communities, and principles and software that enable distributed high through-put computing (DHTC) for users and communities at all scales. 

The OSG does not own the computing, storage, or network resources used by the scientific community. The resources accessible through the OSG are contributed by the community and organized by the OSG; an overview is available at [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/0008/000839/004/OSG%20Intro%20v23.pdf][An Introduction to OSG]].     Today, the OSG community brings together over 100 sites that provide computational and storage resources; a current snapshot of deployment and usage is available at the [[http://display.grid.iu.edu/][OSG Usage Display]].   Additional “how to” information is available at [[https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/UsingTheGrid][An Introduction to Grid Users]].

New research communities wanting to join and use the OSG can contact us by emailing user-support@opensciencegrid.org to start the process.   If you want to form a VO, want to connect your computing resources to the OSG production fabric, or just use the OSG “opportunistic” resources, we can provide technical recommendations and support on how best to benefit from the OSG; we will work with you to understand your needs and help develop a plan that enables you to do science on the OSG.
