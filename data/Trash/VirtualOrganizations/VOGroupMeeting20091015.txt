---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Joint partnership between children's hospital and Immune Disease Institute. Have 2 groups under !SBGrid/NEBioGrid control, plus 1 other.

---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

!GridUNESP: 2000 core cluster. Have Condor running on it, but they're having an issue with running large scale MPI jobs on it in the "Parallel Universe". Or rather, the jobs start very slowly. The Condor experts are looking into it. They're going to install the OSG stack soon and will use DOSAR host certificates until their own VO is up and running.


---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Doing some production, on occasion,  for different members of the Engage VO each week.  Abhishek asked for a document for !CompBioGrid's 2010 requirements; Jeff will follow up with Ion Moraru to get that document completed and submitted.

---+++ !Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

jobs submitted to !FermiGrid now go to the correct O/S (whether SL4 or SL5).
