---++ Announcements

---++ Operational News: (Rob Quick)*

Indiana building new glidein factory that is more in line with a production operational service (i.e., includes things like Change Management, is stable) that is located with other operational functions. Proof of concept is done; hardware has been (almost) ordered. This should be ready in about 3 weeks. The factory will still be administered by the UCSD operators, but it will be overseen and hosted by IU (redundancy, operational oversight, etc.) 

Derek: Will there be an ITB version of the factory? Rob: Yes, but on a VM, so not quite comparable, e.g., inability to load balance. Maintenance will probably will be in line with windows for other GOC operational functions.

Gabriele: How will one front-end be recommended over the other? 
Rob: Most likely, while people are getting set up and familiar, they will use UCSD; more production-oriented workflows will move to IU.
Derek: HCC plans to query and submit through both. 
Gabriele: will need to guide users on proper use. 

Steve: Any plans to use HA features of Condor? 
Rob: We're still trying to figure to what best config should be, but imagines you can use either one or both.

Other news: there's a halt on top level BDIIs due to inconsistencies within new version while trying to figure out what the problems are.




---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ Engagement

Gabriele: Engagement has a newly created front-end for new communities. NEES is the first VO to use it; their experience has been very good, and major progress has been made the last couple weeks. They have negotiated additional ad-hoc quota for a NEES user on a temporary basis; they are also working on using globus online to do data transfer between UCSD and RENCI. A user had some bottlenecks which have now been identified. Also, Marko Sliz has been working with Mats (?) to add more attributes to the front-end configuration. Engagement has been very supportive throughout.


---+++ NEES (Gabriele Garzoglio)

They are using a portal-based job submission from NEES hub. NEES has registered in OIM and will continue to use Engagement for job submission for now. 


---+++ !SBGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

Peter Doherty has moved into a different organizational unit so is no longer as available to handle OSG site issues. (Peter is actively working to get Harvard medical school institutional research computing system onto OSG.)

They have a new team member, a postdoc who is a computational biologist. He has grid-enabled one particular workflow  (roughly 1-3000 hours for one workflow execution; ~1000 jobs max). They also have a summer intern who is working on web design.

Next, they want to set up cycle servers to help with logging. They misunderstood what accounting facilities were provided by !glideinWMS; will look at this more once the cycle servers are up and running .

During the last four months, they have predominantly focused on their web portal environment, a system whereby a user may apply for account, fill out a web form, email verification is done, then SBGrid requests a certificate on their behalf: portal authentication system prevents a complicated multi-stage process.

They have globus online set up; now they can look at grid-enabled services at data collection facilities with guests. For instance, Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Lab uses ftp and honor system to delete confidential information. This system would provide a lot better integration, a better user interface.

They have been running between 1500-3500 jobs the past week or two; could end up at this level continually if new user usage ramps up. They're looking at an integrated SBGrid consortium (1000 possible users with 150 labs). (Some of these users will use Peter's Harvard institutional research system, too).

They are using latest version of Condor; working on managing their jobs. 

Gabriele: !eNMR, an Italian community wanted to submit jobs through !SBGrid; began discussing having a submit node at !SBGrid and at Italy and discussion of accounting. Ian wants to avoid (although feels there is no risk) having a flood of jobs that run through VO that pre-empt local jobs. (1) want to be able to distinguish these users; (2) want to be able to control these users. !eNMR wants to be able to do a proof of concept. 

Derek: recommends they build a condor pool and have it flock to !SBGrid submit host (these jobs have lower priority to locally submitted jobs). !SBGrid can control them. Can do accounting if they install gratia probes.

Gabriele: talking to same front-end so negotator and collector can control the share of jobs going to the system.

Someone from !SBGrid (Dan O'Donovan?) will try to understand whether or not !eNMR wants to integrate their Condor pool with OSG.



---+++ !SURAGrid (John-Paul Robinson)

Several sites have resources for !SURAGrid use. University of D.C. is interested in contributing resources as a cloud environment. 

On the application side, they are working with John McGee and Engagement to bring new users on board. (Users will switch to using !SURAGrid VO once applications are successfully running.)


----+++ !GlideinWMS Gratia Accounting

Below are examples of the gratia accounting graphs available when installing the !GlideinWMS Gratia Probe.  Final patch is with the Gratia developers.  Waiting on them to approve and cut a release.  Ready: O(week).  

The probe will be an RPM like all other Gratia probes.  This is based on the Condor CE Probe used in production on the OSG.  

---++++ By Site:

Note that the picture has odd named resources.  The OSG Factory has recently standardized the resource names to those in OIM.  New probe installs will reflect proper OIM resource names.

---++ AOB

Steve Timm: JDEM is going to be decommissioned, so will no longer be a Fermilab sub-VO.
