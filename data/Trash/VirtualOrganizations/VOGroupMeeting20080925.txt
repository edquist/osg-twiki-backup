---++ OSG plan to migrate from VORS to RSV monitoring (Rob Quick, Soichi)
   * Current VORS location vors.grid.iu.edu 
   * Preliminary Planning Stages Now 
      * First Step is to find out how VORS is being used. How is your VO using VORS? 
      * Some VORS usage data at http://vors.grid.iu.edu/webalizer 
   * Alpha Version of a Replacement at rsv.grid.iu.edu 
      * What is missing from VORS that should be built into a replacement? * Mail suggestions to rsv-dev@opensciencegrid.org
   * VO role call to see who is using VORS and how.
      * official view of OSG WMS is that one-stop shopping for all information is essential.

---++ OSG plan to migrate to new CA certificates distribution (Doug)
   * CA certs are being distributed and installed differently. Although this is disruptive, the instructions are straightforward.
   * Role call to make sure Doug's survey was received and to see when VOs will be updating.
   * Questions should be sent to Doug Olson 

---++ Virtual Organizations Group in OSG: Year3 Goals and new focus (Abhishek)
   * Introductions were made to various members of OSG activities and goals of each person in context of VO Group Meeting:
      * Ted Hesselroth & Tanya Levshina (Storage): trying to work more closely with VOs; provides storage solutions to be part of VDT package; provides user and site admin support for sites; helps users use opportunistic storage provided by OSG sites by working with resource providers and users of storage.
      * Brian Bockelman (OSG Metrics): will be deciding at meeting next week how to proceed in VO group context.
      * Parag Mhashilkar, Gabriele Garzoglio (RESS): looking for more input from VOs on how to extend service so that more people can use it and on how to make it more efficient. No new requests for Gratia are being accepted, but are happy to consider new projects.
      * Burt Holzman (GIP): recently asked for input from VOs on new ReSS release (new input may be too late for this release)
      * Marcia Teckenbrock (OSG Communications): working to obtain information on scientific publications by OSG members; article ideas for what science is being done as a result of OSG.
