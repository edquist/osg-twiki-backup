---++ OSG plan to migrate from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS to RSV monitoring (Rob Q, Soichi)
   * Current VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS location vors.grid.iu.edu 
   * Preliminary Planning Stages Now 
      * First Step is to find out how VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS is being used. How is your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo using VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS? 
      * Some VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS usage data at http://vors.grid.iu.edu/webalizer 
   * Alpha Version of a Replacement at rsv.grid.iu.edu 
      * What is missing from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS that should be built into a replacement? * Mail suggestions to rsv-dev@opensciencegrid.org 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo role call to see who is using VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS and how.
      * Don't use VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS: CiGI, CDF, D0, DOSAR, Engage, ILC, CMS
      * DES: use for getting gatekeeper & job manager info; the rest of the info is from ReSS
      * Fermilab: have script from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS page to see which sites support the Fermi VO; until recently, used Gratia to determine who the site admin (Rob Q. says this is ava. in OIM).
      * NYSGrid: not using programatically, but users do look things up on their own; no problems moving to RSV.
      * SBGrid: uses VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS only to check site status; finds RSV documentation "opaque." Needs to be easier to understand what's going on and better documented; has been a pain getting probes running. 
      * Clemson: uses VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS only to check site status; 
      * STAR: use as a scheduler plugin; use text version (ok, but have to get the site number from the main page, then use that number as a reference on a secondary page to get site info).
      * LIGO: Pegasus pulls info out of.
   * Associated input shared from GIP, OSG WMS, !ReSS. 

---++ OSG plan to migrate to new CA certificates distribution (Doug)
   * CA certs are being distributed and installed differently. Although this is disruptive, the instructions are straightforward. 
      * New procedures: http://www.grid.iu.edu/news/news.php?id=430 
      * Survey for VOs: http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/69345/osg-vo-ca-survey 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo role call to make sure Doug's survey was received and to see when VOs will be updating. 
   * Questions should be sent to Doug Olson 

---++ Virtual Organizations Group in OSG: Year3 Goals and new focus (Abhishek)
   * Introductions were made to various members of OSG Areas and partner projects, goals of each in context of VOs: 
      * Ted Hesselroth & Tanya Levshina (OSG Storage): trying to work more closely with VOs; provides storage solutions to be part of VDT package; provides user and site admininistrator support for sites; helps users use opportunistic storage provided by OSG sites by working with resource providers and users of storage. 
      * Brian Bockelman (OSG Metrics): will be deciding at meeting next week how to proceed in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Group context. 
      * Parag Mhashilkar (!ReSS): looking for more input from VOs on how to extend service so that more people can use it and on how to make it more efficient. 
      * Gabriele Garzoglio (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Services project): no new requests for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Services are being accepted, but are happy to consider new projects. 
      * Burt Holzman (GIP): recently asked for input from VOs on new GIP release (new input may be too late for this release, but is welcome for the next release) 
      * Marcia Teckenbrock (OSG Communications): working to obtain information on scientific publications by OSG members; article ideas for what science is being done as a result of OSG. 
      * Britta Daudert (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Group in OSG): coordinates Weekly VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Forums. 
      * Alain Roy (OSG Software): open to input and feature requests from all stakeholders. 

---++ Forums with different scope: weekly, bi-monthly, email. (Abhishek)
