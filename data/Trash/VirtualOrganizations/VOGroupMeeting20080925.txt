---++ OSG plan to migrate from VORS to RSV monitoring (Rob Q, Soichi)
   * Current VORS location vors.grid.iu.edu 
   * Preliminary Planning Stages Now 
      * First Step is to find out how VORS is being used. How is your VO using VORS? 
      * Some VORS usage data at http://vors.grid.iu.edu/webalizer 
   * Alpha Version of a Replacement at rsv.grid.iu.edu 
      * What is missing from VORS that should be built into a replacement? * Mail suggestions to rsv-dev@opensciencegrid.org
   * VO role call to see who is using VORS and how.
   * Associated input shared from GIP, OSG WMS, !ReSS.

---++ OSG plan to migrate to new CA certificates distribution (Doug)
   * CA certs are being distributed and installed differently. Although this is disruptive, the instructions are straightforward.
      * New procedures: http://www.grid.iu.edu/news/news.php?id=430
      * Survey for VOs: http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/69345/osg-vo-ca-survey
   * VO role call to make sure Doug's survey was received and to see when VOs will be updating.
   * Questions should be sent to Doug Olson

---++ Virtual Organizations Group in OSG: Year3 Goals and new focus (Abhishek)
   * Introductions were made to various members of OSG Areas and partner projects, and goals of each person in context of VO Group Meeting:
      * Ted Hesselroth & Tanya Levshina (OSG Storage): trying to work more closely with VOs; provides storage solutions to be part of VDT package; provides user and site admininistrator support for sites; helps users use opportunistic storage provided by OSG sites by working with resource providers and users of storage.
      * Brian Bockelman (OSG Metrics): will be deciding at meeting next week how to proceed in VO Group context.
      * Parag Mhashilkar (!ReSS): looking for more input from VOs on how to extend service so that more people can use it and on how to make it more efficient. 
      * Gabriele Garzoglio (VO Services project): No new requests for VO Services are being accepted, but are happy to consider new projects.
      * Burt Holzman (GIP): recently asked for input from VOs on new GIP release (new input may be too late for this release, but is welcome for the next release)
      * Marcia Teckenbrock (OSG Communications): working to obtain information on scientific publications by OSG members; article ideas for what science is being done as a result of OSG.
      * Britta Daudert (VO Group in OSG): Coordinates Weekly VO Forums.
