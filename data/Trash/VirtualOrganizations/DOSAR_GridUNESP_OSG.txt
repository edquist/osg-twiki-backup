---++ Introduction

This is a work in progress, we've just started documenting ...

The [[DOSAR_GridUNESP_OSG][GridUNESP]] VO has started their operations by bringing up a CE (OSG site name not known yet), ce.grid.unesp.br, at the main campus at UNESP in Sao Paulo, and will bring up the other CEs at the 7 sister campuses around the state soon.

More information is available at http://ncc.unesp.br/  and  https://www.ncc.unesp.br/cgi-bin/twiki/view .

---++ Technology Model

OSG 1.2 as a front end to a 2048 core Condor pool (at UNESP) and 7 smaller (128 core) sites with almost identical configuration.
These Condor pools will also run large scale MPI jobs.

The current cluster configuration of the main cluster is like this:
   * 4 cluster head nodes with a 36 TB SAN for networked compute node system and home directories
   * 4 Sun Thumpers with 24 TB of raw storage each
   * 256 compute nodes
   * 1st head node for cluster administration
   * 2nd head node currently not used yet
   * 3rd head node for OSG CE
   * 4rth head node for OSG SE ([[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan-Gateway]] on top of Lustre on the 4 Thumpers)
   * Thumpers run gridftp servers
   * All interconnected with Cisco Infiniband
