---++ Introduction

The [[DOSAR_GridUNESP_OSG][GridUNESP]] VO has started their operations by bringing up a CE and an SE at the main campus at UNESP in Sao Paulo, and will bring up the other CEs and SEs at 7 sister campuses around the state of Sao Paulo soon.

See also the [[http://www.ncc.unesp.br/portal/?q=node/25][GridUNESP Charter Statement]] for a more in depth introduction.

More information about [[DOSAR_GridUNESP_OSG][GridUNESP]] is available at http://ncc.unesp.br/  and  https://www.ncc.unesp.br/wiki .

---++ Technology Model

!GridUNESP has deployed OSG 1.2 on the front end CE, !GridUNESP_CENTRAL, ce.grid.unesp.br, and SE, !GridUNESP_CENTRAL_SE, se.grid.unesp.br, to the central 2048 core Sun cluster running !CentOS 5 and Condor as a job scheduler (at UNESP in Sao Paulo), and 7 smaller (128 core) clusters with very similar configuration. All these Condor clusters will also run large scale MPI jobs.

The current configuration of the main cluster is like this:
   * 4 cluster head nodes with a 36 TB SAN for networked compute node system and home directories
   * 4 Sun Thumpers with 24 TB of raw storage each (48 500 GB SATA drives)
   * 256 8-core compute nodes
   * 1st head node for cluster administration
   * 2nd head node currently not used yet
   * 3rd head node for OSG CE
   * 4rth head node for OSG SE ([[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan-Gateway]] on top of Lustre on the 4 Thumpers)
   * Thumpers run gridftp servers
   * All interconnected with Cisco Infiniband
   * Connected to the outside world at 10 Gbps -- well, not yet, but soon! Currently still connected at 1 Gbps.

---++ Operational Model

See the [[http://www.ncc.unesp.br/portal/?q=node/25][GridUNESP Charter Statement]].

---++ Usage

At the moment, only the central cluster is in use, until the new 10 Gbps network to the other sites around the state as well as the official SP Certificate Authority are in place.
