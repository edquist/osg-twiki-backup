---++ Introduction

The [[DOSAR_GridUNESP_OSG][GridUNESP]] VO started their operations by bringing up a CE and an SE at the main campus at [[http://www.unesp.br/][UNESP]] in Sao Paulo, and will bring up the other CEs and SEs at 7 sister campuses around the state of Sao Paulo soon.

See also this   [[%ATTACHURL%/06_Rogerio_Iope_UNESP_Brazil.ppt][Presentation]] and [[%ATTACHURL%/GridUNESP_1st_paper.pdf][Proceedings]] about !GridUNESP at the [[http://indico.eu-eela.eu/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=201][second EELA Conference]], as well as the [[http://www.ncc.unesp.br/portal/?q=node/25][GridUNESP Charter Statement]], for a more in depth introduction.

More information about !GridUNESP is available at http://ncc.unesp.br/  and  https://www.ncc.unesp.br/wiki .

---++ Technology Model

!GridUNESP deployed OSG 1.2 on the front end CE, !GridUNESP_CENTRAL, ce.grid.unesp.br, and SE, !GridUNESP_CENTRAL_SE, se.grid.unesp.br, to the central 2048 core Sun cluster running !CentOS 5 and Condor as a job scheduler (at UNESP in Sao Paulo). 7 smaller (128 core) clusters with very similar configuration will be deployed soon. All these Condor clusters will also run large scale MPI jobs.

The current configuration of the main cluster is like this:
   * 4 cluster head nodes with a 36 TB SAN for networked compute node system and home directories
   * 4 Sun Thumpers with 24 TB of raw storage each (48 500 GB SATA drives)
   * 256 8-core compute nodes
   * 1st head node for cluster administration
   * 2nd head node currently not used yet
   * 3rd head node for OSG CE
   * 4rth head node for OSG SE ([[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationBestmanGateway][BeStMan-Gateway]] on top of Lustre on the 4 Thumpers)
   * Thumpers run gridftp servers
   * All interconnected with Cisco Infiniband
   * Connected to the outside world at 10 Gbps -- well, not yet, but soon! Currently still connected at 1 Gbps.

---++ Operational Model

See the [[http://www.ncc.unesp.br/portal/?q=node/25][GridUNESP Charter Statement]].

---++ Usage

At the moment, only the central cluster is in use, until the new 10 Gbps network to the other sites around the state as well as the official SP Certificate Authority are in place.

One researcher already started running his MPI jobs, submitted via the full grid infrastructure, and we also tested submitting large scale single processor jobs by filling up the whole cluster with DOSAR test jobs submitted from OU. Both gt2 and gt4 jobs have been successfully submitted.

---++ Issues and Solutions

   * [[http://www.ncc.unesp.br/portal/?q=node/21][GridUNESP Workshop]] held at UNESP on December 16, 2009
   * [[DOSAR_GridUNESP_OSG][GridUNESP]] Support Center and Virtual Organization approved on December 16, 2009
   * First MPI job run with full Grid infrastructure run on December 17, 2009
   * CE and SE registered and approved on December 18, 2009
   * Cluster completely filled with 2048 one-hour long DOSAR test jobs submitted from OU on December 18, 2009
