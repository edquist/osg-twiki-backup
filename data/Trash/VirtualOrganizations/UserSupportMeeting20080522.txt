 ---+++ Status of Pending Action Items
   *<strike> [CG] From All Hands meeting - make matrix of VO vs Site from VO tests "hello world" execution.
      * Some thinking to do to minimize work on the result-collection and tabulation side.
      * %GREEN%No further progress thus far.%ENDCOLOR%</strike>
   * [MA] Work through corrected VO contacts list and start contacting VOs for AUPs and Registration policies, think about VO Security Contact security training.
      * In progress. 
   * [AR] How do we get priorities and schedules for VO middleware requests?
      * Abhishek to start a thread next week.
   * [MR]: to send Ruth an email listing target potential future users.
   * [MP]: 
      * CG has run the dates and tenative agenda by EB one more time before putting out on the usual lists (done).
      * No feedback so far, need to establish the attendance
   * [AR], <strike>[CG]</strike>: make sure contact is maintained with !SBGrid and !CompBioGrid.
      * %GREEN%Ongoing.%ENDCOLOR%

      * Working on EGEE contacts to start pilot tests there - there has been a considerable mail exchange with EGEE; focus is now on creating a glexec configuration on select EGEE sites that can allow us to do meaningful testing in absence of a reliable LCMAPS-ish backend.
      * Maxim to contact Shreyas and NERSC about including them - done, Shreyas has authorized accounts, will test shortly.
      * CMS interested in one or two applications (eg !RooFit) that are parallel-capable -not done, need to revisit.

---+++ Engage

*Engagement Applications Status:*  Greg's working on 3 apps:

*FEFF* (material science):
   * having trouble becoming grid-enabled;
   * Engage is doing much of the work; they're willing to help a bit, but don't have necessary skills.
   * We're modifying MPI to a master worker framework.
   * Greg will talk to Miron and John to determine feasibility of enabling this app.
   * Need someone with Fortran experience.
   * What is the metric where we "say no" to applications coming to the table?

*UW Synergy group* (Engineering)
   * having some of the same issues as those above.
   * MCMT (Synergy): just started; not clear whether MPI needed yet.

*UW Independent researcher* Jenny Reid (also Engineering):
   * running locally; hoping to run on OSG w/i 1 month; doesn't need MPI.

*Others:*
   * PNNL: lost interest
   * ICECUBE: "need for more resources didn't overcome reluctance to make them grid-aware."  Now running on GLOW (jobs not submitted to gatekeeper, thus not counted as OSG).

*Problem with researchers "losing interest"*
   * Mats has seen as well, even when we've made it very easy.  People are getting resources elsewhere.
   * Chris sees same thing in osg VO.
