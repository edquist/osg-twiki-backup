---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VOGroupMeeting20081218][Previous week's minutes]]

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ nanoHUB

no update this week; seems to be little activity, looking at gratia; Steve has made changes to the web display of site selection mechanism.

---+++ D0
Overall, status is good, but a new ticket opened w/ Purdue due to low efficiency.

OSG/Teragrid gateway: Joel following directions on site, but is having a problem; Steve and team will help within next couple weeks.

Joel also needs someone from FNAL to enable him to look at SAM logs for SRM caches to see why jobs are failing (leftover issue from late December).

---+++ CDF

UPS/UPD version of SRM has been obtained and tested; further status unknown.

---+++ DES

Nikolay says DES will have a couple big productions this year; DES is not interested in opportunistic storage, will use storage at FNAL only.

---+++ Fermi-VO

More on OSG/Teragrid gateway: Steve feels Fermilab staff and NCSA staff need to meet. (Teragrid does have centralized account management, but not for OSG at large; submission currently can be done to only one site.)  John Townes at TG is an appropriate contact. Steve will keep VO Group posted on what is needed, if anything.

---++ AOB

SBGrid jobs crashing nodes at GROW; due to user who is running a large number of jobs; Abhishek and Britta will follow up at today's Integration meeting. Ian is surprised a user running such a large number of jobs isn't running them from his own VO.

Security Team: Jim reminds VOs this is a good time to do an annual review of VO membership. Joel says gratia is shwoing jobs running in the D0 VO that are not D0 jobs. He will follow up with Fermigrid team and report back to Security team when resolved.

All Hands Meeting:  VO Group represented, in part, at Security Workshop. Ian also organizing a session about inter-site collaboration.
