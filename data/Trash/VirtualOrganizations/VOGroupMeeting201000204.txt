---++ Previous Minutes 

 [[VOGroupMeeting20100121][Weekly Forum: January 21]]  (No minutes January 28)

---++ Announcements 

OSG Trash/Blueprint meeting next week on providing storage solutions.In particular, working on the ability to provide opportunistic/public storage at sites so sites don't need to be contacted one-by-one. We will keeping VOs posted.


---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Packaging for CA certificate package closer, still not quite ready. Pretty soon.

---++ Communications (Marcia Teckenbrock, David Ritchie)

Posters for all hands ready soon. Postcards will be available at all hands--at least samples.
Interested in keeping list of scientific publications that make use of OSG. Contact ritchie at fnal dot gov.

---++ Workflow Discussion:

Experts on Workflow management. Each used by various communities. Dan, Maxim, Igor, and Mats working on paper describing different systems, including pros and cons of each. Goal: to capture items in table to better inform OSG members.). Most likely published within a month on OSG web site where appropriate.

Maxim: PANDA
In past week, email thread with Peter Doherty (!SBGrid). Slides presented where Peter enumerated requirements for WMS. One wish: unified view of the grid. PANDA has a web-based interface that provides this. One disadvantage for this use case: DAG not supported. Brief evaluation of PANDA is recommended (no special s/w installation on their end required).

Igor: Glidein 

Mats: OSG Matchmaker
