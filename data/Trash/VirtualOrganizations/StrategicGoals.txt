---+ Strategic Goals

---++ Overview

In *%MAROON%Virtual Organizations Group%ENDCOLOR%*, center of attention is focused around all *‘At-Large’ Stakeholders, i.e., all Virtual Organizations in Open Science Grid Consortium except CMS, ATLAS, LIGO*. Effort is made to coordinate and organize an ‘At-Large’ Consortium Stakeholder Forum. Goals for Year 3 fall into five categories:

*1.* Make attempts to improve efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility. *2.a.* Provide an avenue for operational, organizational, and scientific discussions with each ‘at large’ stakeholder by organizing meetings and conferences, using a different scope at different frequencies. *2.b.* Report a summary analysis of VOs' inputs, production issues, weekly reports - and in turn - gather Facility feedback in weekly Production meetings. *3.* Facilitate stakeholder participation in the OSG software engineering lifecycle and in the different areas of grid technology in OSG. This includes mutual exchange of requirements as well as operational needs. *4.* Make a strong attempt to enable tactical methods for sustenance of scientific communities that have a newly formed VO. *5.* Provide a platform for Storage team to work directly with all stakeholders and thus to strengthen the Data-Grid capabilities of OSG.

---++ Goals for Year3

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *1.	Organize and coordinate an ‘At large’ Consortium Stakeholder Forum, working with ‘at large’ VOs in making effective use of the OSG infrastructure.* </font>

*1.1.	Improve efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility.*
%BR%1.1.1.	Monitor efficiency and usage of all ‘at large’ Science stakeholders regularly, and initiate action for stakeholders that have markedly low wall efficiencies in utilization of OSG.
%BR%1.1.2.	Work with stakeholders, one or a few at a time, to understand known causes of low wall efficiencies, and to possibly suggest measures for improvement. If needed, follow through with Operations, Sites, Storage, Accounting, and peer OSG groups.

*1.2.	Organize meetings and conferences to enable communication.* 
%BR%1.2.1.	Organize a weekly VO forum meeting, often inviting select stakeholders for focused discussion on ongoing operational tasks. 
%BR%1.2.2.	Organize a monthly VO forum meeting, inviting representatives of all ‘at large’ stakeholders, for open “virtual round-table” discussions.
%BR%1.2.3.	Organize an annual face-to-face meeting, inviting representatives of all ‘at large’ stakeholders and key OSG staff, for extensive exchange of operational, organizational, and scientific experiences.
%BR%1.2.4.	On an ongoing basis, provide information to ‘at large’ stakeholders on different areas of grid technology in OSG. In turn, collect stakeholder feedback and operational needs; communicate back to different areas of grid technology in OSG. 
%BR%1.2.5.	If needed, serve as catalyst for transition of new grid technologies into productive use by ‘at large’ stakeholders.
%BR%1.2.6.	Continue to enable Security and Policy matters, related to all ‘at large’ stakeholders, and if needed, also ATLAS, CMS, LIGO.

*1.3.	Compiling of scientific publications by OSG ‘at large’ VOs that resulted from substantial use of the OSG infrastructure.*

*1.4.	Stakeholder participation in OSG software engineering lifecycle.*
%BR%1.4.1.	Toward planning and preparation of a new VDT release, solicit and collect requirements from ‘at large’ stakeholders. Assist in planning of new software features with Project Management and VDT/Middleware teams.
%BR%1.4.2.	Toward validation of a major new incremental OSG release, organize “stakeholder pre-release validation”. Coordinate with ‘at large’ stakeholders and ATLAS, CMS, LIGO to validate, and thus to officially approve, the pre-release using Integration Testbed (ITB).

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *2.	Provide a first stage of sustainment for newly engaged VOs.*  </font>

2.1.	Work with Engagement and Education teams to provide effective support to “new entrants”.
%BR%2.2.	Help Engagement assess readiness of a “new entrant” to officially form a new VO.
%BR%2.3.	Gauge progress of a new VO, suggesting improvement measures if needed.
%BR%2.4.	Help advance MPI resource advertisement for Engagement team. Continue ongoing coordination work with Engagement, GIP, !ReSS teams and MPI resource providers – NERSC, NCSA, Purdue.

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *3.	Help evolve and strengthen the Data-Grid capabilities of OSG.* </font>

3.1.	Enable provisioning of Opportunistic Storage by USCMS and USATLAS sites, by deploying and operating a functional Testbed.
%BR%3.2.	Subsequently, provide guidelines and procedures to enable ‘at large’ stakeholders to leverage usage of Opportunistic Storage.
%BR%3.3.	Identify and execute targeted campaigns of 4-8 weeks duration that allow an ‘at large’ stakeholder to transition from no use of opportunistic storage, to successful use at sites that support this stakeholder for opportunistic computing and storage.
