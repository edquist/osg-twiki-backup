---+ Strategic Goals

---++ Overview

In *%MAROON%Virtual Organizations Group%ENDCOLOR%*, work is focused around ‘At-Large’ Stakeholders, i.e., all Virtual Organizations in Open Science Grid Consortium other than CMS, ATLAS, LIGO. Effort is made to coordinate and organize an ‘At-Large’ Consortium Stakeholder Forum. 

<!--
Goals for Year 4 fall into five categories:
*1.* Make attempts to improve efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility. 
*2.a.* Provide an avenue for operational, organizational, and scientific discussions with each ‘at large’ stakeholder by organizing meetings and conferences, using a different scope at different frequencies. 
*2.b.* Report a summary analysis of VOs' inputs, production issues, weekly reports - and in turn - gather Facility feedback in weekly Production meetings. 
*3.* Facilitate stakeholder participation in the OSG software engineering lifecycle and in the different areas of grid technology in OSG. This includes mutual exchange of requirements as well as operational needs. 
*4.* Make a strong attempt to enable tactical methods for sustenance of scientific communities that have a newly formed VO. 
*5.* Provide a platform for Storage team to work directly with all stakeholders and thus to strengthen the Data-Grid capabilities of OSG.
