---++ Previous Minutes 

[[VOGroupMeeting20101028][Weekly Forum: October 28]] 


---+++ Security

Galois (http://www.galois.com/)  received small business initiative funding from DOE to provide identify management solutions for collaborative sciences; picked OSG to work with; have some ideas, but see OSG as prime environment to which to deliver tools. 

Galois has gathered feedback from OSG and wrote up a document about needs and problems (See [[http://grid2.galois.com/needs-and-problems.html][http://grid2.galois.com/needs-and-problems.html]]. They are very willing to adapt to OSG's needs and very open to feedback. For those who would like to provide feedback, please look at the aforementioned document and provide input...
   * to Mine directly: maltunay at fnal dot gov.
   * at next weeks VO Forum
   * based on feedback, Mine may bring Galoise to meeting next week.

Also, an email was recently sent to all security contacts to update their accounts in OIM. Please do check your profile and roles and make sure your entry is up to date.

---+++ Communications (David Ritchie)

Reminder of SuperComputing Nov. 13-19 in New Orleans. Fermilab booth is #1643. Email ritchie at fnal dot gov for more information.


---++ VOs In Focus


---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

Working with Philippe Canal and an individual at LLNL on gratia probe for SLURM. Hoping this will be working in a month or so. 

As discussed at a prior meeting, there were some GIP issues (accounting info may be understated) that needed to get resolved. A solution was put forth by NERSC, but Jeff will find out whether this has been implemented. 

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

D0 had an issue at Cornell. There were aborted jobs in scratch area that couldn't be cleaned up. Steve Timm helping with what to do with pbs at batch system. Don't know if this is being fixed.


---+++ !GLUE-X

Not present.

---+++ !GROW (Daniel Squires)

Trying to re-establish the VO; hope to get everything up and running on OSG within a year. Immediate plans include totally reconfiguring the cluster; turning current nodes to worker nodes. Daniel will report on areas where he needs help as he comes across them.

---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

KISTI seems to have a procedure to delete files after crash, which seems to be the root of the prior problem. In the meantime, CDF has 
~ 9 TB input data running through production and copying back to Fermilab. They are making good progress and KISTI is about to add another hundred nodes for CDF use. 

However, the Running Experiments group at Fermilab reported glidein problems. (They have a separate portal for CDF users.) Steve Timm has asked Rick to run stress tests before KISTI site can be reinstated. Are stress tests for !FermiGrid only or for OSG in general?  

There will be an offline discussion, facilitated by Chander and including Gabriele, Steve Timm, and Igor, between OSG and CDF to help them solve several issues. 

KISTI gives dedicated resources to CDF. 

---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini) 

Working on Sao Paolo workshop to be held in early December.
