---++ ITB 1.1 validation by VOs

Closure date will be sometime next week.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Doug reported via email that (1) the OSG security team is preparing some materials for the
site admins workshop (Aug. 6,7) to provide basic information for Tier3 site administrators on what is expected of them and (2) STAR has done some tests on 3 ITB sites for VO validation.

---++ Storage 

---++ Communications (Marcia T.)

No news items reported.

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

Because they're using the VO box, limited as to how they can test; should have results within next day or so.
  
---+++ !CompBioGrid

Not present.

---+++ GEANT4

Not present.

---+++ GPN (Greg Monaco)

Currently updating our mission statement; will follow up with OIM registration.

Work with Engagement progressing; next step will be to find more users. Greg has a questionnaire for users. Mats suggests not asking for too much detail in it. 

---+++ !IceCube 

Not present.

---+++ !NYSGrid

Not present.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioMed (Peter Doherty)

Mixed results on ITB testing; still in progress. Working on a 120-core-cluster build hopefully done by end of summer; this is more targeted towards !NEBioMed but there is overlap.

---+++ Engagement (Mats Rynge)

ITB testing looks good so far; 2 more sites to go.

Efforts with GPN progressing; working with Kate Adams (the sysadmin); next step is finding a local user.

---++ AOB

OSG is preparing for FY10 and looking for updates from VOs who sent feedback within next couple weeks.
