---++ Announcements


---++  Presentations


---+++ CDF - Aidan Robson

See slides attached below.

- Production continuing smoothly at FNAL, Kisti, and MIT

- Now also running on Eurogrid sites

- CDF would like to see OSG provide a service (or tools) to certify that a site is ready for production; examples being tests of the batch system and firewall.  This would have helped a few months ago when Kisti was brought on-line for CDF.

- The near-term focus is to preserve their production environment for the next 1-2 years; not looking to add new processing resources.

---+++ DREAM - Alan Sill

Please see the [[http://highenergy.phys.ttu.edu/dream/][DREAM collaboration web pages]].  DREAM uses [[http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/ssh/][gsissh logins]] to support general data analysis, and [[http://globusonline.org][Globus Online]] to move data.

- The science is testing new types of calorimeters

- The collaboration has a few dozen scientists

- When they are active, they periodically produce data sets of ~1 TB

- Their production is done via gsi-ssh login to the TTU site (perhaps also European sites in the future)

- Use Globus Online to move data from CERN to TTU; and from TTU to the local computers of their researchers


---++  Open Forum

Dzero - Joel Snow reported that production is proceeding smoothly

!GlueX - Richard Jones reported that they had a good week of running production.

SURAGrid - John-Paul Robinson reported continued work to get the first test application ready for running on OSG (should be ready within the next month)

DOSAR - nothing to report
