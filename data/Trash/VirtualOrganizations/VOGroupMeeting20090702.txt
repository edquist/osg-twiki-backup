---++ ITB 1.1 validation by VOs:

Validation has begun; expecting almost a dozen VOs, including D0 and CDF.
  
---++ Security (Doug)
  
Nothing to report.

---++ Storage (Neha)

Abhishek reports working with ICECUBE towards using opportunistic storage. Whether they will follow D0's example using SRM or something else is TBD.

---++ Communications

Two items to report as news to Dave: D0 milestone and Fermi VO's work on the OSG - TG gateway. (Neha and Ruth are meeting about the latter at 3PM Monday, July 6th; good place to get details.)

A problem with the server environment after a reboot caused some inefficiency in job success. Joel is still in touch with sysadmins at Caltech (re problem with job submission) and Chicago. 

---+++ Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

Validation from site perspective: had problems after VDT update, but working to get ITB site up; should happen today, and Steve will update ITB page when it does.

Met with SMU today; will likely bring their site to support the !NOvA experiment within a month.

Steve has been working with Rick Salcido of NIU regarding CALICE; Again, CALICE is part of EGEE but is unable to get grid certs to use US resources. Rick now has a submit form.
