   * Step 2: efficiency 
   * site selectionjob scheduling/work-flow management: Steve talked to Brian Bockelman; the display to monitor site status is not sufficient. nanoHUB uses VORS first, but it doesn't reflect actual status of sites (Fermi VO agrees). LIGO uses ReSS--likewise, info not always accurate. 
   * Suggestion is to form a task force w/ members from OSG Accounting, Metrics, a GOC members as needed, OSG Condor team. Abhishek will work to determine who's on it. 
   * CA Cert transition: nanoHUB has not yet made the transition. Steve will talk to Mine offline.
