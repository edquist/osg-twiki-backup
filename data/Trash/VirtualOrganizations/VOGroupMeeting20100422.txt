---++ Announcements 

*Software Evaluation Proposals (Abhishek Rana:)* Two proposals from Alain Roy (S/W coordinator) regarding support for certain platforms: 
([[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP3][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP3]],
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP9][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP9]]). Please send email if your VO depends on these platforms.

*Job Submission Comparison Documentation (Dan Fraser):* Completed [[http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/JobSubmissionComparison][OSG job submission comparison document: (OSG DocDB #9620)]]. (This is not a stand alone document. OSG still wants to work with !VOs to find the best solution.)

(Document summary provided) 

Q: Is Glidein WMS system available to others not using central service? 
A: Yes. So is PANDA. Can set up own instance, but there's a centralized service out of San Diego. The VO does need to intall a client to talk to WMS, users just submit jobs.

*Scientific Publications (David Ritchie):* (See attachment to minutes). We are in the process of collecting publications that relate to the benefits to OSG to be sent to NSF/DOE. We will ask for a complete list of publications from VO management in the next three or four weeks. Publications are to be categorized in 3 areas (scientific publications, OSG and related projects, OSG papers for general reference; see examples at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/What_We%27re_Doing/Scientific_Publications][http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/What_We%27re_Doing/Scientific_Publications]].
You're welcome to send in your list now to osg-contact at opensciencegrid dot org

*VO Resource Predictions:* We are trying to understand needs of all !VOs to identify any hard limits. Please see/update [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/OSGResourcePredictions][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/OSGResourcePredictions]] or [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/FineGrainProjections][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/FineGrainProjections]] with your usage projections to help us make sure capacity meets needs.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Reminder: SecurityTeam team looking into ways to integrate registration process for !GridCerts and !VOs. Any VOs who would like to talk to SecurityTeam team welcome to email Doug @ dlolson at lbl dot gov.


---++ VO in focus 

---+++ CDF

Not present.

---+++ CHARMM (Tim Miller)

Running under OSG VO using VOMS proxy. actively and getting results; studying molecular dynamic simulations of mutant proteins. 90 or so active threads, over 1000 jobs. Have a few more models to run, then get results to JHU collaborators and get feedback.

PANDA has been steady and reliable lately. Machine at Wisconsin submits pilot jobs. 

Scientific publication is intended.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Last two days: 50% above 30 day average.Installed !SEs at SPRACE and Sao Paulo inc. efficiency in getting input files.
D0 does not need !O/Ses in question.

Still has not heard back from UTA. Joel will ping again and cc Dan and Abhishek.


---+++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Usage projections for !Fermilab-VO are on Production twiki for calendar years 2010, 2011, and 2012.



---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Heavy load, mainly from GPN; ~90% efficiency. Local users complaining about availability. Trying to balance local users and adjust priority--then ran across feature where the higher priority you have, the longer you wait. So you either have to pre-empt or lower people's priorities.

Condor bug: GPN glideins were also failing. would run for a while, then sit idle for days. KO'd them but they recurred. Brian B found bug in glidein executable. working on patch. !SBGrid jobs coming through.

Richard will let Dan know when beginning to set up glidein WMS.

Open GOC ticket showing data not available for BDII. Abhishek will look at answers.

---+++ nanoHUB

Not present.


---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Doing a lot of production job management; watching and correcting as we go. Getting pretty good concurrent job runs; efficiency not consistent from day to day.
Dan F: probably depends on how active the big !VOs are (could be getting pre-empted). 

Would be nice to know whether and why jobs are pre-empted.  Abhishek will put Peter in touch with Igor Sfiligoi, who has been looking into this.

Plans on testing glidein WMS and PANDA. Mats has been very helpful with !MatchMaker.
