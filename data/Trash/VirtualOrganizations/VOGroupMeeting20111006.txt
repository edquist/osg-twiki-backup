*Revised Dates* - The OSG glideinWMS team at UCSD is organizing a glideinWMS frontend workshop at UCSD, tentatively for the week spanning January 16 to 20.  

The tentative structure is as follows:

   * a couple of days of training
   * a day or so of discussion among various existing frontend admins
   * a day or so of brainstorming about what should be the best practices and possibly writing them down

All VO Front-end Administrators are invited and encouraged to attend, if possible.  Please let Igor know if these dates work?  Also, would the week before or after work, if it would not work for others?

Please email Igor directly on this matter....  Thanks,  Contact Info:  Igor Sfiligoi   Email = sfiligoi@fnal.gov

---+++ VDT Native Packaging (RPMs) Update - Alain Roy and Suchandra Thapa

I talked at this meeting on August 25th: [[VOGroupMeeting20110825#VDT_Moving_to_RPMs_Alain_Roy][Previous Presentation]]

Brief recap:

<blockquote>
*1. We are stopping new Pacman-based releases of the VDT.*
   a. The existing Pacman caches will remain as long as needed (a year or more)
   a. We will do urgent updates as necessary. (Urgent means “security” or “really important”)

*2. By December 2011, we will provide RPMs for most of the VDT.*
   a. Supported OSes: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, Scientific Linux 5, CentOS 5, 32 & 64 bit
   a. Included: 
      * VOMS
      * Worker node client & glexec
      * Client
      * CE & RSV
      * Bestman & XRootd
   a. Not included (yet):
      * GUMS
      * Gratia Collector
      * CREAM
</blockquote>

So what's happened in the last six weeks?

*Production Software Releases* <br>
We have released VOMS (server and client) and our CA certificates as a "limited" release. This is a supported, production release, but it is not widely announced. While primarily intended for early adopters, it is available to anyone who wants it. We've also released the software that drives http://display.grid.iu.edu/ and http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/ .

[[Documentation.Release3.ReleaseNotes][Release Notes]]

*Software stabilized, ready to test* <br>
A large set of our RPMs are stable (we are only releasing bug fixes and essential updates) and ready for widespread testing. This is where you can be helpful--are you ready and able to test? Specifically, the following software is stable and ready for widespread testing:

   * VOMS (released)
   * Worker Node Client
   * glexec
   * Client
   * Bestman & Xrootd
   * RSV
   * CE (GRAM interface only)

An interesting note: We've been working hard with the Globus Project to introduce a new version of Globus as part of our release. This is a significant update, and one that we expect to work much better than past releases. It introduced some complexities in our installation, so make sure you follow our installation directions carefully (particularly the bit about yum priorities).

*Software in progress* <br>
Some other software is still being finalized:

   * CE (information services & configuration): expected within a week
   * HDFS, integrated with !GridFTP. Expected within two weeks.

*How can you help?* <br>
The more testing we have, the better our software will be when we release it. If you can help in any way, testing any portion of the software, we will all benefit from your testing. You can find documentation at:

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/

We will gladly provide support and help as you try it out.
