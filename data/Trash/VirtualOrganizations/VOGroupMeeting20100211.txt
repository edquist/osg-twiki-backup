 [[VOGroupMeeting201000204][Weekly Forum: February 4]] 

---++ Announcements 

Updates: Document Improvement Workshop earlier this week. Small team w/ Integration, Storage, Security, & VO Group; led by Jim Weichel, Area Coordinator for Content Management. URL here. shows outcome:  New scheme for Twiki page organization/ownership. Input welcome from all VOs!

All Hands Meeting preparation.

Opp Storage: organized model for D0; ongoing blueprint meeting intention to produce a summary regarding this.

---++ Security 

There will be an update to the CA distribution that we are currently testing next week.

---++ Storage

Nothing further to report.

---++ Communications 

Nothing further to report.

---++ VOs in focus 

---+++ CDF (Joe Boyd)

FNAL outage Tuesday. CDF came through pretty smooth.

---+++ CHARMM (TIm Miller, Maxim Potekhin, Jose Caballero)
Studying molecular dynamics of proteins in collab with JHU. Looking at different amino acid sequencing, mutations of proteins to see how they affect structure and function of proteins. 

Q from Ian Stokes-Rees: also do molec dynamics. run for 2 months on 64 core cluster. Wondering how they configure CHARMM to do jobs?
(a)Instead of running one sim for tens of nanoseconds, run large numbers of computations in parallel. 
(b) trying to get MPI working to lengthen the amount of time for simulations.

Current status: there has been a hiatus in CHARMM usage of OSG; teams started submitting jobs to PANDA; technical issues need resolving. Will present at All-Hands if results.  (Really need to ramp up production before having a lot of meaningful results to talk about.)

Jose  best way to improve is to increase # of sites. 

First set of runs a couple years ago: need gridftp access to storage server, which was the main stumbling block last time.Doesn't gridftp need to be installed on every site?

Can add all sites accepting certificate. Need to confirm which VO CHARMM is part of. Think it's OSG.  Once VO is confirmed, Tim will send an email and we will work to help expand the number of sites. {Link to old document}.


---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Trouble ticket for strange GRAM errors; some headway; updated today.
Updated CompBioGrid Blog
Some production jobs running; site otherwise quiet.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Tuesday, all power in FNAL computer center went out. Didn't recover job submission for26 hours; servers didn't recover properly. Back to regular productivity by tomorrow, I hope.

---+++ !Fermilab-VO 

Not present.

---+++ !GlueEX 

Not present.

---+++ !GridUNESP (Rogerio)

Noticing working with main infrastructure. Main cluster operational, but still in rem phase. air cond problems; several 100 LIGO jobs had to be stopped, but now fixed.
Also working with researchers, who will start running jobs in about 1 or 2 months.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

Reasonably well; past several weeks, ramping up # of jobs. Running pretty steadily at 3000 concurrent jobs. Now back down to only 1000. not clear why. Specific changes in local configuration to go from 1000 to 3000. Need to 15,000-25,000 hours per day. Will be up to 120,000 hours soon.

High failure rates (about 43%), but results indicate not quite as bad.

Need to figure out where jobs are getting evicted and why. It's hard to get a good picture of that.

Still, getting results back; can run big workflows and get results quickly. 

Testing PANDA, which has a lot of features that are configurable. Maxim and Jose.
Flat workflows, 100,000 iterations of particular applications chunked together. How well are the pilot workflows?
