 [[VOGroupMeeting201000204][Weekly Forum: February 4]] 

---++ Announcements 

There was a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/DocumentationTeam/DocImprovementWorkshop][Document Improvement Workshop]] earlier this week, consisting of a small team of participants from Integration, Storage, Security, & VO Group; led by Jim Weichel, Area Coordinator for Content Management. The product is a new scheme for Twiki page organization/ownership. Input welcome from all VOs!

[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/allhands][All Hands Meeting]] preparation.

The ongoing Blueprint meeting is expected to produce a document regarding a new model for Opportunistic Storage. 

---++ Security 

There will be an update to the CA distribution that we are currently testing next week.

---++ Storage

Nothing further to report.

---++ Communications 

Nothing further to report.

---++ VOs in focus 

---+++ CDF (Joe Boyd)

FNAL outage Tuesday. CDF came through pretty smooth.

---+++ CHARMM (Tim Miller, Maxim Potekhin, Jose Caballero)
Studying molecular dynamics of proteins in collab with JHU. Looking at different amino acid sequencing, mutations of proteins to see how they affect structure and function of proteins. 

Q from Ian Stokes-Rees: also do molec dynamics. run for 2 months on 64 core cluster. Wondering how they configure CHARMM to do jobs?
(a)Instead of running one sim for tens of nanoseconds, run large numbers of computations in parallel. 
(b) trying to get MPI working to lengthen the amount of time for simulations.

Current status: there has been a hiatus in CHARMM usage of OSG; teams started submitting jobs to PANDA and technical issues need resolving. Will present at All-Hands if results.  (Really need to ramp up production before having a lot of meaningful results to talk about.) (See documents on CHARMM: [[http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1000740][ISGTW article about our efforts]], [[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18834189][Our publication from previous work]])

Jose: Best way to improve is to increase # of sites. 

First set of runs a couple years ago: need gridftp access to storage server, which was the main stumbling block last time.Doesn't gridftp need to be installed on every site?

Can add all sites accepting certificate. Need to confirm which VO CHARMM is part of. Once confirmed, Tim will send email and we will work to help expand the number of sites. 


---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Continuing work on trouble ticket for strange GRAM errors; made some headway. Also updated [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/CompBioGrid_OSG][CompBioGrid Experiences Blog]]. Some production jobs are running; site otherwise quiet.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Tuesday, all power in FNAL computer center went out. Didn't recover job submission for 26 hours; servers didn't recover properly. Back to regular productivity by tomorrow, it is hoped.

---+++ !Fermilab-VO 

Not present.

---+++ !GlueEX 

Not present.

---+++ !GridUNESP (Rogerio Iope)

Main cluster is operational; Working with researchers, who will start running jobs in about 1 or 2 months. 

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

Things going reasonably well, ramping up # of jobs. Made specific changes in local configuration, which took from 1000 to 3000 concurrent jobs. Were running steadily at 3000 concurrent; now back down. Not clear why. Failure rate @ 43%, but gratia indicates lower failure rate. Hard to get a good picture of where jobs are getting evicted and why. Currently testing PANDA, which has a lot of configurable features. Maxim and Jose would be good to talk to (had left call).
