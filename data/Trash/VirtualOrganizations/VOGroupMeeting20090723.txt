---++ Announcements:

Shaowen Wang: Looking for second VO council representative to represent the collective of the smaller !VOs. If interested, please email Shaowen at shaowen at uiuc dot edu. Council meeting will begin tentatively August 11th near O'Hare at Chicago and will be not quite 2 days. Representatives from these !VOs are encouraged to attend. The council is starting to think about the next 5 years within OSG.

---++ ITB 1.1 validation by VOs

Almost 13 VOs participated; more details below.

---++ Storage 

---++ Communications 

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ ALICE 

---+++ !CompBioGrid

Busy behind the scenes; hardware work; cluster back to 100% after electrical failure; probs w/ local pbs server (when use to submit jobs to CE, it interfered w/ production. Broke out server and made a separate one for OSG jobs; testing and appears functional.) Waiting for next s/w release to rebuild next CE to get on same page as those who will be help. Have intern working on app development; working on tools to find which sites are best suited for running their jobs. 

---+++ CDF

ITB testing: Dennis updated matrix; ran jobs on all 5 validation sites; not able to get science workflow; will update again. Most pending. Finishing up.

Did succeed @ Caltech.

---+++ D0

Failure for central db; update of disk drivers on big machine revealed bug. Lost 4 days. Also, change to configuration of way files routed from spamcache to SE due to typo: no jobs run at CEs with SEs was a 2-day problem. Both problems fixed. All else as usual. 

A taskforce formed at Fermilab between Fermigrid and SAM Operations people to facilitate geting TG gateway to work.

Upgraded/changed latest SE protocols at Nebraska; coupled w/ routing change, have enabled D0 to use the SE at 3 Nebraska clusters; efficiency at SEs that hadn't been using has been increased; allocation had been increased.  

SEs may expire: need a document asking for renewal; will be addressed at Council meeting. Joel and VO group will get in touch with SE sites in coming weeks and appeal to admins for renewal.

---+++ !Fermi-VO

Not present.

---+++ GPN

Not much to report; given Abhishek updated document re: GPN and planning process. Circulated document among key people who operate central sets of resources for campus, which was helpful. As VO manager, Brian Bockleman used as sponsor.  At DOEGrids CA site, those who don't already have a cert get an exception error, which is problematic for non-grid-savvy users.

---+++ !SBGrid

ITB testing: First round of tests, which have been reported; waiting to hear back from Ian. Will try to report final by end of day. 


---++ AOB
