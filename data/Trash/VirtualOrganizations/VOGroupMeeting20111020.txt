---+++ Integrating Globus Online with glideinWMS - Parag Mhashilkar 

Workload Management Systems (WMS) like glideinWMS address the management
of compute resources in OSG; however, data management in the
Grid is still the responsibility of the VO. In general, large VOs have
the resources to develop complex custom solutions, while small VOs would
rather push this responsibility to the infrastructure. The latter 
requires a tight integration of the WMS and the data management layers, 
an approach still not common in modern Grids. In this talk we describe
a solution which integrates glideinWMS with Globus Online (GO).
