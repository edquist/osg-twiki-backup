---++ Announcements

Rob Quick reported that LBNE is now enabled as a VO; and that GROW is removed as a VO, for now.

Chander reported that we will conduct these calls every other week from now onwards due to fall-off in participation; we will get feedback on this from the VOs.

*Next call will be Thursday, Nov 3 at 1:30pm central.*

Workload Management Systems (WMS) like glideinWMS address the management
of compute resources in OSG; however, data management in the
Grid is still the responsibility of the VO. In general, large VOs have
the resources to develop complex custom solutions, while small VOs would
rather push this responsibility to the infrastructure. The latter 
requires a tight integration of the WMS and the data management layers, 
an approach still not common in modern Grids. In this talk we describe
a solution which integrates glideinWMS with Globus Online (GO).


---++  Open Forum

SURAGrid - John-Paul reported no issues.

SBGrid - Ian reported no issues.

!GlueX - Richard reported no issues.  He did inquire about how to access GPUs in OSG and run jobs there; User Support will attempt to get such information (maybe Greg Thain at Wisconsin can help) and pass it along to Richard

Engage - Mats reported no issues; some questions about available cycles that still need further analysis.
