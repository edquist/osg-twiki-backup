---++ Announcements

OSG staff are starting the annual report due in June. Will be getting engaged with all stakeholders and collect a list of all scientific publications in past year. David Ritchie working with Abhishek. David will report more in coming months.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Follow up to identity management workshop in November, 2009: Looking into being able to integrate registration processes for obtaining grid certs and registering a VO. Short term: Might change interface when upgrade of DOEGrids CA software over next few months. 

Doug would like to hear from other !VOs concerned about this issue.  Contact Doug Olson dlolson at lbl dot gov.

!CompBioGrid, GROW & GPN, and CHARMM: no issues with current system.



---++ VO in focus 

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Still doing production, mostly Engagement running. Working same ticket:  When a user uses globus-job-run if a firewall is enabled, even if there's an exception, one port has intermittant failures  50% of jobs (after only 100 jobs out of 5000). Turning this off causes jobs to run fine; may close ticket for now; Marco Mambelli should be kept in loop. (A clean install may fix issue.) 

Focus now is on moving into new building and will shift work to setting up server room. May be getting a new production cluster. If so, current cluster would then be made into OSG cluster. 



---+++  GLUE-X

Not present.

---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

trouble ticket - changing time out fixed it. VOMS.request.vo.membership.lifetime was changed from 120 to 172800. 

---+++ GROW (Jeffrey De Reus)

Troubleshooting job submission to external sites; hopes to have cleared up shortly. People getting involved again. CMS Tier-3 site: getting a lot of push on; Dan Fraser can talk with Jeff if needed. Engaging other sites on campus: not much.
