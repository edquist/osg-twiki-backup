---++ Agenda
---+++ CHARMM progress and needs

---++++ Overview
<ul>
<li>CHARMM is a computation chemistry application: molecular modeling and simulation.</li>
<li>WMS includes PANDA + home-brew add-ons.</li>
<li>Structure is a DAG: each "run" consists of about 30 job clusters, which produces a simultaneous job load of 30-80, and a running time of about 10-14 days under smooth running conditions and full utilization.</li>
</ul>

---++++ Current status
<ul>
<li>2 production runs currently in progress.</li>
<li>WMS is currently not very robust ie site failures have a significant effect on run execution time -- current runs have already exceeded 2 weeks each.</li>
<li>Sites in use:
  <ul>
  <li>UFlorida-IHEPA.*</li>
  <li>OSG_LIGO_PSU-pbs</li>
  <li>UWMadison-condor</li>
  <li>UFlorida-PG.*</li>
  <li>USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE.*</li>
  <li>FIU-PG.*</li>
  <li>UCSD.*</li>
  <li>Nebraska-pbs</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Frank pointed out that the following sites are lightly loaded right now and should be used to the maximum:
  <ul>
  <li>UWMadison-condor</li>
  <li>UFlorida-PG.*</li>
  <li>USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE.*</li>
  <li>FIU-PG.*</li>
  <li>UCSD.*</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Currently only one pilot job per site is pending at any one time. Tim responded that he does not know how to change that configuration but could find out from Torre.</li>
<li>Frank pointed out in an email that due to the 5-minute scheduling cycle of Condor, only 1 pending job will require many hours to ramp up to fully utilize a site.</li>
<li>[[http://gridui02.usatlas.bnl.gov:25880/server/pandamon/query?job=*&ui=user&name=Ana+Damjanovic&reload=yes&type=&days=3&jobStatus=&site=][CHARM job status page]].</li>
<li>Gratia not reporting much for OSG VO right now because most jobs (except test jobs from Tim) appear to be running as Torre due to the configuration of the PANDA instances. These jobs are currently indistinguishable from Torre's ATLAS jobs in Gratia.</li>
</ul>

---++++ Action
<ul>
<li>Tim to maximize use of Frank's list of sites in the short term by increasing the number of pending pilot jobs</li>
<li>Tim to increase the ability of the WMS to recover from site failures.</li>
<li>Tim to investigate correcting the PANDA configuration to submit jobs as the production manager's DN (Ana Damjanovic) and the OSG VO instead of Torre's DN and usatlas.</li>
</ul>

---+++ Troubleshooting: Usability campaign

---++++ Discussion
<ul>
<li>Shaowen joined the call and introduced the user campaign.</li>
<li>Frank suggested a more focussed effort in the short term to make sure some of the smaller VOs are as happy as they can be to avoid the problem of a large number of initial reports leading to lots of branches of activity and little progress on each due to limited resources.<br>
Chris thought wouldn't be much of a problem since many problems would be common or have common solutions, which is what we're after.<br>
Agreed that US group to concentrate on following VO's while actual report influx was relatively light:
<ul>
<li>CHARMM ([[http://gridui02.usatlas.bnl.gov:25880/server/pandamon/query?job=*&ui=user&name=Ana+Damjanovic&reload=yes&type=&days=3&jobStatus=&site=][status page]]);</li>
<li>Engagement ([[http://www.renci.org/~rynge/osg/status.php][status page]]);</li>
<li>D0.</li>
</ul>
Shaowen agreed that Troubleshooting group handle site-specific problems.</li>
<li>Chris mentioned that Mats' testing system would be good at testing site availability, at least from the point of view of the Engage VO.</li>
</ul>

---++++ Action
<ul>
<li>Chris to check in with Parag on D0 status and issues.</li>
<li>Chris to follow up with Tim following his discussions with Torre.</li>
<li>Chris and/or Frank to check in with Mats and advise to submit many more jobs to known-working sites.<br>
%RED%Update from Frank%ENDCOLOR%: Mats is getting more supported and operating sites, and is increasing site-submit limits gradually.</li>
</ul>

---+++ User satisfcation survey
---+++ July workshop
---+++ Other current issues
---+++ AOB.
