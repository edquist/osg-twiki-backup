---+++ [[VOGroupMeeting20080911][Previous week's minutes]]

---++ 

---++ SBGrid

Taskforce in effect. Work is in progress.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow) with OSG Storage (Tanya Levshina)

D0 is planning to add h/w for VO-specific infrastructure; work on MIT is progressing (SE in place but not activated due to some problems), no improvements @ Purdue.

Joel will talk to Alan Sill @ Texas Tech to pursue a storage there.

Efficiencies looking better than in past.

---++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark) with OSG Accounting (Philippe Canal)

   * [[NanohubNotes][Aug 21 discussion]] 
   * Goals: 
      * Understand possibility of different conventions, and thus variations in job accounting; nanoHUB vis-a-vis Gratia. 
      * Try to diagnose causes of low job success rates. 
      * Suggest, and move forward, measures to improve job success rates, i.e., nanoHUB efficiency. Encourage nanoHUB to increase utilization of OSG Facility. 
      * Solicit nanoHUB's citing OSG usage in publications and in scientific result 
   * %BLACK%Accounting Discrepencies:%ENDCOLOR% 
      * %BLACK%Are "grid jobs" and batch jobs both being reported by nanoHUB? <br />%ENDCOLOR% 
         * %BLACK%Preston to send Philippe list of condor jobs and/or look at condor_history by next week.<br />%ENDCOLOR% 
      * %BLACK%New possible problem: Jobs not appearing on days Preston thinks they're running; Philippe would like to track a job from start to finish.%ENDCOLOR% 
   * %BLACK%Step Two: look at job success rates: after accounting issues resolved%ENDCOLOR% 
   * %BLACK% *Status:* differences in accounting schemes have been resolved (wallclock duration used by GridMonitorJob is reported by Gratia but not nanoHUB). nanoHUB will apply suitable changes to query. They are ready to move to step 2: looking at job success rates. Gratia's newest release will separate GridMonitorJob into a new category so they won't be included in default reports. %ENDCOLOR% 

---++ CDF (Dennis Box)

Asked by Donnatella to participate; getting feet wet.

---++ VO Security and Policy (Doug Olson)

OSG Security wants to establish connection w/ VO group and promote regular channels of info and feedback. Doug will try to attend weekly. He'd like a biweekly security item on agenda.

From last Users Meeting, there were questions about VO policies, what types of policies should VOs have, what are their obligations & liabilities?

Larger, established VOs already have bylaws and membership policies. Would these VOs please send Doug (dlolson at lbl dot gov) location of membership policies?<br />D0: Joel will check w/ Qizhong <br />CDF: Dennis<br />nanoHUB: Steve<br />CMS: Burt H.

---+++ Inactive VOs

   * Geant4: Abhishek will email ET to determine best course of action 
   * GRASE: Abhishek will email Russ Miller (GRASE has morphed into NYSGrid) 
   * For others: Britta & Abhishek will look at list together offline 

---++ Usage by OSG VO, OSG-Edu VO (Mike Wilde, Charles Bacon, Zhengxiong Hou)

   * Goal is to mutually understand ways to avoid the recent occurrence of site overloading by an OSG/OSG-Edu VO user. Suggestion by Charles Bacon: Rather than focusing on good client behavior, why not look at server config options? OSG1.0 has newer version of globus; the back part of GRAM4 event schedule generator is better at not putting a load on the head node and has the abililty to enable SAG(?) in job manager. Can the OSG consider implementation, and who should request be directed to? Abhishek recommends Charles speaks w/ Rob Gardner, OSG Site Coordinator. 
   * Mike Wilde has related matter. Xi Li is a user who is part of a larger effort where students @ Chicago are trying to determine the best way to properly communicate problems on the OSG to the necessary channels, which in turn improves the OSG. 
 <blockquote>These students, from a couple different user communities are looking at site selection, job scheduling, installing s/w on a large # of sites, etc., but what kind of procedure should they follow when they run into problems? (eg: one person is trying to test his automated installer. He can access 18/30 sites, but on the remaining 12, there are a series of problems. <br /><br />Does he report all the problems as separate GOC tickets?<br /><br />Is there an ombudsman for these students to go to?<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Suggestion from VOG is to submit a single GOC ticket, then see how that is followed. There is also a bi-weekly meeting between Engagement, Education and a subset of the VOG. </blockquote> 
   * Another issue is that it is confusing for these students to determine the definitive source for system configuration info. General consensus is that there is no one tool for complete info. What if there was a flat text file, updated by the GOC or a single person with this information? Every site would be responsible for maintaining there info. Mike is willing to ask his students if they want to do the work to get something like this started.
