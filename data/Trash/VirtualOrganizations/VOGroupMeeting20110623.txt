---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ GLOW (Dan Bradley)

Not available

---++ Open Discussion


---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

They are trying to get the Livermore site integrated with OSG and able to receive jobs. 


---+++ CDF (Aidan Robson)

A few weeks ago we started accessing our LCG sites through a single entry point, using the UCSD glidein factory -- glidein functionality
shelters the user from site problems so we're grateful for that OSG resource getting extra CPU for CDF. There are 12 sites in Italy, France, Spain and Germany.  An update on capacity will follow after some more experience. 






---+++ HCC 
HCC running on the OSG is out of cores; they are still getting space from Purdue. They are currently only running ~1300 jobs on the grid.
