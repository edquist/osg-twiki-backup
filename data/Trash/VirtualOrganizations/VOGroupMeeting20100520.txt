---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

Thanks to OSG stakeholders who have sent in Scientific Publications. If you have not already done so, please send to osg-contact at opensciencegrid dot org.

Planning to invite annual stakeholder updates to https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements . More details in coming days.

---++ Security (Doug Olson, Mine Altunay)

We encourage VO managers to evaluate potential use of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGetCmd][new script interface]]. These scripts are expected to help your VO's members to get grid certificate and to import it as a PKCS12 file into web browsers. OSG Security and VOs Group teams have heard from VOs in past that users have more inconvenience while requesting, retrieving, and saving a certificate with web browser. (Script does everything that is otherwise done to import your certificate in your web browser using the command line.)

VOs are requested to please send feedback to osg-security-team at opensciencegrid dot org; is script easy to use? are you having any problems? 

Concerning latency in getting certificates. (Some sites say it takes 5 days). If this happens, please let security team know.

---++ VO in focus 

---+++ CDF

Not Present.

---+++ !CompBioGrid

Not Present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

D0 faced internal infrastructure problems in last few days, leading to reduced production. 

UCONN: Joel in touch with Richard Jones.
GPN cluster errors from last week: gridftp processes were stuck on server; a restart fixed this. Fermi-VO helped in investigating the cause.
UTA: still waiting on Robert Illingworth.

---+++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Fermilab-VO has now added input to the [[DirectFeedbackOnProductionProblemsOrBottlenecks][Direct Feedback On Production Problems Or Bottlenecks]] page. Abhishek has extracted key points and added to Dan's document.

Estimated projections for all !sub-VOs are available for the next 2 calendar years. Already posted for next calendar year; Steve will send the 2011 and 2012 projections (mostly based on past usage) to Dan and Abhishek.

Fermilab-VO is also helping diagnose problem with D0 collaborator from France using SAGA API. Hit gatekeeper b/c of several globus job runs. Mike Wang helped diagnose problem. Multiple GOC tickets have been opened by the D0 user (involving Notre Dame, Texas Tech, Florida, GUMS team). Abhishek is adding Joel to the tickets and looking to find an EU-based D0 liaison. 

---+++ GLUE-X

Not Present.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

!GlideinWMS: running pilot jobs on 3 clusters and ironing out bugs; using the "Factory" provisioned by UCSD.

Q from Dan: how hard was it to transition from scripting environment to Glideins? Peter and Abhishek: SBGrid uses NAT. Condor did not directly support this network topology; Dan Bradley from Condor team supplied a quick patch. It has been tested and now deployed by SBGrid.

Abhishek noted the SBGrid usage since the start of 2010: wall hour consumption has been cyclic; peak 70,000 wall hours per day. Peter pointed out that next 6 months are expected to follow the same pattern, with a slightly higher scale.

SBGrid is interested in both mechanisms (browser and command-line based) for certificate import. A problem with the new mechanism is that it requires an additional overhead of installing OSG stack components using Pacman - unlike the browser based mechanism. End-users are less likely to have access to such centrally-installed software stack. Browser based mechanism is standalone, however it is confusing due to the need to create and remember 3 passwords.

---+++ Engagement (Mats Rynge)

Cert scrips: been using for host certs for a while, but not yet user certs. Most documents point to the older method, making it difficult to navigate to the newer mechanism without prior knowledge of the URLs.

New mechanism is likely to solve some issues where people make request and then have issues downloading type of cert. (E.g., some people have items installed in browser that cause cert import to fail)

There's a disconnect: Obtaining a certificate can be simplified, but then a user will still need to register in VOMS. Security team is thinking about a way to try to integrate both steps, but nothing concrete is currently available.

Doug noted that the new scripts do provide PKCS2 option.

Discussion of storage issues: Trash/Engagement team is looking to find a storage solution for a user with new usecase: a genomic database with fixed amount of data (600GB, broken into nearly 10GB for a workload). Each job in workflow needs to access the data, with some mechanism to stage-out data to local disk. Abhishek and Dan noted that two possibilities are Squid and SRM. Squid may not be able to handle data larger than a few MBs. Discussion to be followed up offline.

---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

DOSAR team is trying to ramp up efforts to get Archaeologists and Paleontologists colleagues based in South Africa. 

---++ AOB

Jose Caballero: Regarding new cert script mechanism: Main problem with new user is dealing with several passwords (master, passwd to create, password to encrypt).

Jose has been contacted by some OSG staff to take up responsibility for OSG-EDU VO. Abhishek and Marcia will gather more details and follow up offline.

CHARMM:  23 new sites added this week. (Earlier, were only using 3). Should cause a scale-up in CHARMM production.

New PANDA user documentation available at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/panda][http://www.opensciencegrid.org/panda]]
