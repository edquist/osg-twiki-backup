---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

Thanks to !VOs who have sent in Scientific Publications. If you have not already done so, please send to ritchie at fnal dot gov.

A template for updating projected usage will be sent to !VOs soon.

---++ Security (Doug Olson, Mine Altunay)

We encouraging using the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGetCmd][new script interface]] to get your grid certificate and to import it as a PKCS12 file into your web browser if needed there. It is clear that people have more trouble if they start by requesting a certificate with their browser.
(Script does everything that is otherwise done to import your certificate in your web browser using the command line.)

VOs: please feedback to security team, osg-security-team at opensciencegrid dot org; is script easy to use? are you having any problems? 

Concerning latency in getting certificates. (Some sites say it takes 5 days). If this happens, please let security team know:

---++ VO in focus 

---+++ CDF

Not Present.

---+++ !CompBioGrid

Not Present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Infrastructure problems last couple days, so a little less production. 

UCONN: Joel in touch with Richard Jones.
GPN cluster errors from last week: gridftp processes were stuck on server; a restart fixed this.
UTA: still waiting on R. Illingworth.

---+++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Did add some job submission problems they've seen, which has been added to centralized document.

Projections for all !sub-VOs for next calendar year posted; Steve will send the following year's projections (mostly based on past usage) to Dan and Abhishek.

Outside of !Fermilab VO: helping diagnose problem with D0 collaborator from France using SAGA API; hit gatekeeper b/c of several globus job runs. Mike Wang helped diagnose problem.

---+++ GLUE-X

Not Present.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

!GlideinWMS: running pilot jobs on 3 clusters and ironing out bugs; using UCSD factory.

Q from Dan: how hard was it to transition from scripting env to Glidein: biggest problem is that server sits behind NAT; Condor bug had to be overcome.

!SBGrid usage has been cyclic; peak 70K wall hours per day. Next 6 months expected to be much the same, maybe a little higher.

SBGrid interested in both mechanisms for certificate import. 

---+++ Engagement (Mats Rynge)

Cert scrips: been using for host certs for a while, but not yet user certs. Engagement doc points to! DOEGrids web site.

Solve some issues where people make request and then have issues downloading type of cert. (ppl have items installed in browser that causes cert import to fail)

There's a disconnect between getting certificate, but then still need to register in VOMS. Security team thinking about a way to try to integrate, but nothing concrete.

Script does provide pkcs2 option.

Discussion of item from Production call, talked about user who needs to have a db a fixed amt of data (600GB-up to 10GB for a workload) on site and all processors need to access db. Possibly look into CMS I/O model. 

---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Trying to ramp up efforts to get South African archaeologists and paleontologists  who are interested in joining involved.

---++ AOB

Jose Caballero: Re: browser cert script: Main problem with new user is dealing with several passwords (master, passwd to create, password to encrypt).

Re: last 2 weeks, 3 different ppl in 3 different means have asked to be admin for OSG-EDU VO. Abhishek and Marcia will follow up offline.

CHARMM:  23 new sites added this week. (Was only using 3). Should cause production to be multiplied.

New PANDA user documentation available at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/panda][http://www.opensciencegrid.org/panda]]
