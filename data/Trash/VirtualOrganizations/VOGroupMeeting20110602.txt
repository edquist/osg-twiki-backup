---++  VOs In Focus 



---+++ CDF (Aidan Robson)

KISTI offline for a few days for planned outage, part of which was to increase disk available to worker nodes. Needed 20GB per slot. 

Question: Is there a recommended amount of reasonable disk space?

The [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/SitePlanning][Site Planning document]], which has guidance on this.

---+++ Engagement 

(Provided email update)


--- GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

About 95% job success rate. GlideinWMS front end problem was cuasing some jobs to fall out.

Richard is having trouble getting access to run jobs at the LC-GLCC ALICE site; the access policy is very tight now. Looking for spare slots at different places. 

Question regarding XROOTD running through Dcache; would like to take advantage of locally mounted files. Marco recommends talking to Tanya Levshina, Charles Waldman or Andy Hanushevsky. (He will send email with contact information.) 

!VOs: If you are having trouble running at UCONN, please let Richard know. 



---+++ !SBGrid

Not present.

---+++ !SURAGrid (John-Paul Robinson)

Users are having good success getting their sites online using OSG documentation. 

!SURAGrid has 17 resource contributors; 3 sites are already OSG sites; 3 sites actively working on converting to OSG. 


---++++ Fermilab VO (Steve Timm)

Nothing to report.
