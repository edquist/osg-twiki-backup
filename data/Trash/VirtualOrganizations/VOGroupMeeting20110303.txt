---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

Things are running fairly smoothly. Just running Monte Carlo jobs at KISTI. Hoping to run reprocessing jobs as well. Will negotiate a downtime to upgrade the network around beginning of April. Still concerned about large file issue: (~8GB),  

Gabriele finalized the agreement to have a gentleman from KISTI come to Fermilab around mid-May for three months. He will work in the grid interface management department spending part time on CDF computing issues and will also help the grid cloud computing department to extend the !FermiCloud infrastructure.

Marko: Has been investigating running stress tests. The goal is tp create an infrastructure to test and display test results; CERN Hammercloud software is one possibility; also considering using RSV, but unclear on whether this is the proper technology.

---+++ Fermilab (Steve Timm)

There's been a big increase in MINERVA production over last month or so; NOvA production is also rising.

Last week Steve attended a VOMRS/VOMS convergence conference at CERN.CERN is planning on getting rid of VOMRS by the end of the year.

---+++ GLUE-X
 
Not present.





---++ AOB

Marko: We've are finishing the initial phase of the integration of the OpenSees program, which simulates the effects of earthquakes on
structures, with the OSG infrastructure. A user from NEES can now submit useful jobs and collect their results. There are some more details here: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Engagement/EngageOpenSeesB
