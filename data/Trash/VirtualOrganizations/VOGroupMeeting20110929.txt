---++ Announcements

The *OSG glideinWMS team at UCSD is organizing a glideinWMS frontend workshop* at UCSD, tentatively the first week of December (5-9).

The tentative structure is as follows:

   * a couple of days of training
   * a day or so of discussion among various existing frontend admins
   * a day or so of brainstorming about what should be the best practices and possibly writing them down

All VO Front-end Administrators are invited and encouraged to attend, if possible.  Please let Igor know if these dates work?  Also, would the week before or after work, if it would not work for others?

Please email Igor directly on this matter....  Thanks,  Contact Info:  Igor Sfiligoi   Email = sfiligoi@fnal.gov

---+++ SBGrid - Ian Stokes-Rees

   * Harvard Medical School cluster "Orchestra" is now up and running, but only accepts SBGrid VO jobs: HMS-Orchestra-Dev.; approx. 4000 cores
   * Stopped getting weekly Gratia reports at end of Aug.
   * Made progress with !FreeIPA v2 + VOMS + !MyProxy + CLI cert req/ret to streamline new user account creation; makes it easier for users to get credentials and use them for submitting jobs (Basney/Altunay are aware of this work and design so as to insure that this use case is supported in the future Id Management plans of OSG)
   * No problems accessing the needed quantity of opportunistic cycles in the last few months; basically demand limited at present

---++  Open Forum
   * Fermilab/* VO - Steve Timm reported no issues with production.  On a different topic, the Gratia weekly reports have been broken for a few weeks and should resume with the next cycle (next Monday); please let Steve know of any problems that are observed.

   * DOSAR - Horst Severini reported that planning continues, in partnership with Jose at BNL, for the Ghana outreach training
