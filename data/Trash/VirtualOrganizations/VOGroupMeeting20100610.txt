[[VOGroupMeeting20100603][Weekly Forum: June 3]] 

---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

Preparing for Annual OSG report to NSF. Thanks to all stakeholders who compiled list of scientific publications. We have 300+ publications from a variety of !VOs.

Inviting annual stakeholder updates regarding planned usage and requirements.



---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Kate Adams (GPN): 


---++ Storage  (Abhishek - for Tanya Levshina)

---++ CDF (Stephan Lammel)

Question from Stefan: SL5 values have different rpm lists for SL5. Does OSG have a package of standards of what users can expect to find in VDT? Beyond the minimum requirements for SL5, nothing further should be needed. Because OSG is a heterogenous environment, it is difficult to provide standardized lists and baselines. OSG also does not mandate which O/S should be used.  

Site feedback for what desired SRM list is might be possible.

---++ OSG-VO (CHARMM Group) (Tim Miller, Maxim Potehkin)

Run into issue with CHARMM: beg. of May, had problems with PANDA (and autopilot) as submission system. Pilots weren't being picked up. Working with Jose Caballero. Issue still ongoing. Issue with credentials.

Maxim: CERN moved service and a bunch of certificates went missing during installation. Many users' certs broke. Ticket filed several days ago, and work has begun on fixing. Maxim is waiting for OSG-VO membership to investigate further. 

<Larger issue: Who approves OSG VO membership as Chris Green transitions out? >

CHARMM continuing work on Mutant project. Almost through one and one-third of a way through two more. No new submissions since problems above not resolved.


---++ CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Not present.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Having infrastructure problem over past week. 

Did get UTA SE for our system. Is functional and will start using soon.

Jobs being blocked through !GLUE-EX. (Richard will report on later - GOC#8710). 

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steven Timm)

5 sub-!VOs submitted scientific publications since last week.

Trying to figure out best way to transition clusters from SL4 to SL5. Do other !VOs have any experience with this?
Documentation will be important. 
 
---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Second group of users learning how to PANDA to submit jobs for Monte Carlo production for !GLUE-X.

Production issues: 
Ticket open with local network security:  appears that grid vendor-supplied firewall/NAT blocking jobs when large groups submitted together.

Ticket #8710: D0 jobs blocked; error says SSL negotiations during socket setup; tests show failures at various sites: FNAL, OU (which is using its own software stack w/ an SRM interface; not VDT). Need to check logs. Horst: OU  running newer SAM station version than FNAL? Joel continuing to work with Richard.

Steve Timm: NAT could cause issue.

PhD thesis on !GlueEx.


---++ !IceCube (Steve Barnet)

Just finished installing VO frontend glideinWMS (working w/ Igor and Dan Bradley); will ramp up soon.

Ticket #8627 :German researcher requesting !FermiGrid account; Steve will ask not to pursue.

GLOW usage did have scientific research regarding OSG that Juan Carlos sent to David Ritchie. 


---++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty / Ian Stokes-Rees)

Continuing work with glideinWMS Running 2000-2,500 jobs for past 4 hours--great news. (Looking to go a little higher, but some big sites really busy right now.) Will continue to run and see how scalability works.

Richard reports that UConn added 400 production cores, plus !CompbioGrid adding ~350 node clusters, so more storage resources on the way.


---++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Trying to get archaeologist started. In talks with LTU have code for optical reconstruction used for Image recognition of tomography pictures. South Africans also interested.  

---++ AOB

Robert Engel (Documentation Alignment): Variables added to most pages.
