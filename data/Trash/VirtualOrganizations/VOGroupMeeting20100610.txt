[[VOGroupMeeting20100603][Weekly Forum: June 3]] 

---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

Preparation ongoing for Annual OSG Report to NSF; due later this month. Our sincere gratitude to all stakeholders who compiled a list of scientific publications (July'09 to June'10). This cycle resulted in more than 350 publications from a wide range of VOs/stakeholders. David and Abhishek are now in final stages of collating the list; but publications are welcome throughout the year.

We are inviting annual updates to the planning documents - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Kate Adams from GPN has asked to be added in OIM registry for the VO. Due to transition between GPN and HCC teams at Nebraska-Lincoln, current GPN data in OIM is unclear; needs to be updated. Marcia will advise Kate on further steps.

---++ Storage  (Abhishek - for Tanya Levshina)

Storage team is looking into potential addition of iRODS as a storage solution; more details in coming months. 

We are inviting stakeholder participation in the OSG Storage Forum; at University of Chicago on September 21-22. Meeting webpage is http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceProgram.py?confId=3377.

---++ CDF (Stephan Lammel)

CDF is restarting work on the production expansion plan to use more OSG sites opportunistically. CDF needs SL5. Stephan asked for OSG policies on support for OS versions: SL5 versus SL4. Dan and Abhishek pointed out that OSG does not mandate OS requirements on resource providers - a site decides its own OS versions and flavors. 

Abhishek added that current discovery mechanisms rely primarily on the gatekeeper configuration. So, if a site has heterogeneous mix of OS versions, there is a need for remote identification of OS version additionally on worker nodes. Based on Sep'09 discussion between Burt Holzman and VOs Group, a BDII based tool to find OSG sites with SL5 on gatekeepers is: http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0909&L=OSG-VO-FORUM&P=R1983. More background is:

---++ OSG-VO (CHARMM Group: Tim Miller, Maxim Potekhin)

CHARMM group is almost completely finished with a 3 nanosecond simulation of one of the mutants being studied; 3 more configurations are approaching half done. Need to run several more mutants and then analyze them; plan is to finish up simulations during this summer/fall, leading to a publication in the spring of 2011.

Work is ongoing is to expand CHARMM production from 3 sites to 23 sites; using !PanDA with active help from BNL team. In beginning of May, production was halted due to !PanDA server problems. BNL !PanDA server is physically located at CERN; certificate issues brought down the central autopilot system. Maxim pointed out that BNL is tracking the problem at CERN and resolution is expected soon. 

Maxim is waiting to get approval on OSG-VO membership to investigate further. (Chris Green and Steve Timm have now taken care of it. With Chris's transition, Ruth has taken on responsibility as the VO manager for OSG-VO membership requests).

---++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Not present.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

D0 monte carlo production had internal infrastructure problems over past week; causing some slowdown in production.

Access to UTA SE is now complete; SE is functional; D0 plans to start using soon.

D0 is trying to start using CE and SE at the GLUE-X site UConn-OSG. A few problems under investigation: UConn-OSG sites has NAT, and uses NFS-lite. Site configuration has led to blocking of !GlideinWMS jobs after a threshold rate. Possible reason given by Steve Timm: site firewall may be misinterpreting glideins as a !DDoS attack, and dropping subsequent network traffic.

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steven Timm)

5 sub-VOs submitted scientific publications last week.

Trying to figure out best way to transition clusters from SL4 to SL5; looking for other VOs and sites who have experience with this.
 
---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

GLUE-X applications to start on OSG in coming months. Users are learning how to use !PanDA to submit jobs for GLUE-X Monte Carlo production.

UConn-OSG site related issues: Investigating effects of local network security on other VOs job threshold: appears that vendor-supplied firewall/NAT blocking jobs when large groups of jobs are submitted together by a VO. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8579

D0 jobs blocked; SSL negotiation issue during socket setup. Tests show failures at various sites: !FermiGrid and University of Oklahoma site (which is using its own software stack with an SRM interface; not VDT). Horst Severini pointed out that OU site is running newer SAM station version than !FermiGrid. Problem can be rooted in the proxy being double-limited due to NFS-lite configuration. Investigation ongoing between Joel Snow, Richard Jones, Steve Timm, Horst Severini, Abhishek. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8710

Richard mentioned that a !PhD thesis in GLUE-X benefited from use of OSG; his group will send the citation to Marcia or to osg-contact@opensciencegrid.org.

---++ !IceCube (Steve Barnet)

Deployment of VO glideinWMS front-end is complete. Dan Bradley and Igor providing assistance.

Steve and Abhishek will further discuss the ramp-up plan of !IceCube in coming months.

An !IceCube member from Europe requested !FermiGrid account; experienced with EGEE but not OSG. Steve Barnet, Steve Timm, and Abhishek decided that it would be good if the user goes through !IceCube group at Wisconsin and uses the workflow which has been modified for OSG; ticket to be closed soon. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8627

---++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty / Ian Stokes-Rees)

Continuing work with !GlideinWMS. Running 2000-2500 jobs sustained over hours. Looking to go a little higher, but some large sites really busy right now; will continue to run and see how scalability continues.

---++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

DOSAR is trying to get the archaeologist collaborator started with use of OSG. Additionally, DOSAR is in talks with LTU on optical reconstruction application used for image recognition of tomography pictures. A few users in South Africa have also expressed interest.

---++ AOB

Robert Engel (Documentation Alignment): VOs Group has now added variables to most pages; work to continue in coming weeks.
