---+!! Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at BNL - Computations on OSG

---++ Introduction
The PET group at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and Stony Brook University is interested in the generation of "system matrix", a simulated response model of the detector that translates into a matrix with a few billion non-zero elements. The computation is relatively straightforward but of massive-scale. For some detector systems the computations exceeding 50 CPU-years, above the capacity for dedicated and opportunistic local resources. This proof-of-principle phase aims at running some of these computations on OSG opportunistic resources.

---++ Overview

The PET Group at BNL has built, or is in the process of building, a number of PET detectors for different purposes. Our most widely known detector is the 
[[http://www.chemistry.bnl.gov/ratcap][RatCAP]], a PET detector that can be worn by an awake rat. This allows us to image the brain of the rat while it is doing  whatever it is a rat is doing, and study how it reacts to stimuli, food, light, and so on. For a recent high-profile paper, see [[http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v8/n4/abs/nmeth.1582.html][this publication in Nature]]. 

The common denominator of all our detectors is a custom-made chip (ASIC, Application Specific Integrated Circuit) which integrates most of the detector functions in one small, low-power chip. The ASIC can be used to build different detector geometries. 

A newer development is to make the design MRI-compatible. This means to eliminate all ferromagnetic metals from the electronics boards; they would break in the strong magnetic field of the MRI. The new design is used to develop two similar-looking detectors, the Breast Scanner for mammography applications, and the UPenn scanner, which will allow to simultaneously image rodents (rats, mice) with PET and MRI. MRI, which images the water density in tissue (the protons in water), gives high position resolutions, while PET can image the metabolism, for example, a high use of sugar in a growing cancer.  

For a quick overview of the technology and the envisioned use of the OSG, have a look at [[http://www.phenix.bnl.gov/~purschke/osg_summary.ppt][this presentation]].
