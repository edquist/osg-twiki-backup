---+!! Positron Emission Tomography (PET) at BNL - Computations on OSG

---++ Introduction
The PET group at BNL is interested in the generation of "system matrix", a simulated response model of the detector that translates into a matrix with a few billion non-zero elements. The computation is relatively straightforward but of massive-scale. For some detector systems the computations exceeding 50 CPU-years, above the capacity for dedicated and opportunistic local resources. This proof-of-principle phase aims at running some of these computations on OSG opportunistic resources.
