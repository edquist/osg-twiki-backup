---+++ Fermi VO

Steve feels Fermi groups are using OSG resources as much as possible. There's a lot of peaks and a lot of downtime for various experiments. Most Fermi users don't run offsite, but that will surely change in the future.

Issue? Fermi VO takes all VOs but all VOs don't take Fermi VO. They are worried that everyone at Fermi is automatically in the gridmap file. Upper managment will have to decide how to handle this.
---+++ CDF VO

---++ 2) Inactive VOs

Britta & Abhishek are classifying VOs into following categories:
   * active and doing science 
   * providing resources 
   * OSG-specific 
   * inactive 
      * inactive, but likely to ramp up effort 
      * inactive, unlikely to ramp up effort. 

   * CompBioGrid, Ion: expecting to ramp up within two weeks. 
   * Mariachi, John: is working towards greater usage; currently not using OSG facilities but using OSG software, hoping for utilization within 2 months. 
   * fMRI & Gadu: no response to e-mail query made by Britta. (Don't have contact anymore because individuals associated with VOs have left their positions. 
   * GPN: David Swanson at Nebraska said they were ramping up. 
   * ILC: ramping up. As they're learning how to use the infrastructure, their job submission rate is improving. 
   * Geant 4: no response to e-mail query. Maybe you have to go through the GGUC (European equiv. of GOC)? Abhishek will think about how to proceed. 
   * I2U2:hoping to do student project on the grid; project still active; don't know if they still want to use grid. Abhishek will think about how to proceed. 
   * SBGrid has task force at work 
   * I2U2: educational VO 
---++ 2) AOB

---++ Pending Action Items
---+++ Concerning Inactive VOs
   * Geant 4, I2U2 have been non-responsive, contact again at a later point 
   * Mariachi, ComBioGrid (likely ramping up), contact in two weeks to check on progress 
   * fMRI, GADU (likely ceasing operation) have been non-responsive, Ruth, Miron to be informed
