---+ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Group Weekly Forum | October 16, 2008

   * Thursdays 1:30 PM Central Time. 
   * Phone (510) 665-5437, Meeting ID 1111. 

---+++ Attending

Mine Altunay (OSG Security), Britta Daudert (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo group in OSG), Steve Clark (nanoHUB), Nikolay Kuropat (DES VO), Steve Timm (Fermi VO), Abhishek Singh Rana (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo group in OSG), Marcia Teckenbrock (OSG Communications)

---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoGroupMeeting20081009][Previous week's minutes]]
---++ 1) VOs in focus

---+++ nanoHUB
   * Step 2: efficiency 
   * site selectionjob scheduling/work-flow management: Steve talked to Brian Bockelman; the display to monitor site status is not sufficient. nanoHUB uses VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS first, but it doesn't reflect actual status of sites (Fermi VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo agrees). LIGO uses ReSS--likewise, info not always accurate. 
   * Suggestion is to form a task force w/ members from OSG Accounting, Metrics, a GOC members as needed, OSG Condor team. Abhishek will work to determine who's on it. 
   * CA Cert transition: nanoHUB has not yet made the transition. Steve will talk to Mine offline. 
---+++ DES

Nikolay submitting jobs to Teragrid via the Fermilab gateway. Sometimes submitted jobs stay idle. TG has tools to request resources in advance, but this is not possible via the Fermi gateway. Neha agrees OSG users need some way of knowing when TG resources are running and a way of increasing our priority.

There's been a big developement by Warren at UTexas. He has Condor ClassAds that describe 5 or 10 different TG resources. Neha is trying to get the gateway to read it. (Even so, we still don't know which OSG user couldrun where on TG.)

nanoHUB is using same community account mechanism on TG and OSG. There is a single entry in the TG gridmap file.

Larger issues: how to we get to run on more TG sites and how do we get a large bulk of VOs accepted rather than individuals? More work is needed and eventually, OSG and TG management need to discuss.

Re: DES, in short-term, not much needed from OSG. Getting close to the end of the technical work that is needed. NCSA (John Collins) and OSG management should meet.

---+++ ILC

User eductionfor indiv. users is the current effort. It's unclear whether help is needed from OSG yet, but it was suggested that osg-edu VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo may be appropriate to get new users started right away. Low job failure and wasted wallclock hours. They are not using any sit selection service, as they are funning on Fermigrid only.
