Experience with transition from Pacman to RPM  - Richard Jones & Alain Roy
 
The UConn (!GlueX) site started the upgrade to R3.0 RPM based software from R1.2 last Saturday.  A series of issues have been identified in this upgrade and will need to be addressed.  1) Richard will open GOC tickets for the problems and ask for them to be routed to the software team; 2) Marco Mambelli will provide pro-active support to UConn and help coordinate OSG staff support to resolve the issues; and 3) Alain Roy will update documentation based on the feedback from Richard.
