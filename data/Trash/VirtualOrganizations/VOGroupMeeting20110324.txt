---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ SURAGrid (John-Paul Robinson, David Matthews-Morgan)

!SURAGrid is a new major new multidisciplinary VO. 
Their grid environment came out of NMI testbed back in 2004. They are largely a campus-based VO with varying levels of computational and grid-level expertise. Variety of science domains. 

Some of their challenges are MPI issues and familiarity of users. They are fairly familiar with OSG; they share some members with OSG, particularly from ATLAS and CMS.

They have explored setting up test services, have a CA that ties all their !SURAGrid instititutions (not IGTF certified), and have preliminary account management.

Their short-term goals are trying to understand how to have campus reps that are part of SURAgrid participate in the RA process for !DOEGrids CA. (Rob Quick will help them. They need list of sponsors and their credentials, then can get started on approval process.)

In parallel, they are looking to get their core services ready.

VO User Support, GOC, and OSG Sites are all happy to help.

May 2 & 3 is !SURAGrid's Biyearly Users meeting in D.C.. They would like to have an OSG install fest; OSG expert availability would be useful. 

---+++ FermiGrid (Steve Timm)

A sub VO for accelerator division is being registered this month. The group has been in existence for ~ a year.

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Downtime on RSV this week because Richard migrating dcache to chimera. Richard reports that the README instructions worked very well.

Lots of jobs are coming in and failing; traced to changes that were manually made in VOMS updates that are overwritten by VOMRS.

Richard expressed concern about VOMRS going away. Eventually, it will be migrated to something else, but it will be well-supported and will converge two separate registration solutions. Nothing to worry about.

Local users are oversaturating queues, which isn't an issue with glideinWMS.

On the Production side, things are ramping up. Users only submitting locally, but Richard is working on getting them to reconfigure their sites to make use of glideinwms.
