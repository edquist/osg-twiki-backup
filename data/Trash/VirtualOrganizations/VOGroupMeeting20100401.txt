---++ VO in focus 

---+++ Fermi-VO (Steven Timm)

Discussion on Fermilab's projections for production-related needs. Emphasis on providing 2010 estimates in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/OSGResourcePredictions][Production team's OSG Resource Predictions table]]. Steve is in discussions with FNAL management to get accurate official estimates. MINOS may continue to be the most active consumer (5.4 Mhours in 2009; unofficial estimate nearly 8 Mhours in 2010). Data for other sub-VOs needs to be collected for [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/FineGrainProjections][finer-grained estimates]]. ILC estimates may have to be collected separately.

Steve will send a preliminary document to Marco and Abhishek on mechanisms to advertise heterogeneous sub-cluster parameters.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow offline)

Monte-carlo production average ramped up (to 12 M Events/week,134,000 wall-hours/day at 81% efficiency). 

Availability and number of batch slots at CMS T1 has increased now. Possibly, no immediate need to increase number of sites available to D0. Looking to increase efficiency at available sites. E.g., efficiency is: 
   * poor at ce.grid.unesp.br, osg-ce.sprace.org.br, umiss001.hep.olemiss.edu
   * not satisfactory at osg.rcac.purdue.edu, prairie-fire cluster at UNL
