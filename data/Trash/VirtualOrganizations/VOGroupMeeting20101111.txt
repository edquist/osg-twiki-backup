---++ Previous Minutes 

[[VOGroupMeeting20101104][Weekly Forum: November 4]] 

---++ Security
---+++ Galois discussion

Galois representatives Josh Hoyt and Jeff Bell are on-call. Galois has gathered feedback from OSG and wrote up a document about identity management needs and problems (See http://grid2.galois.com/needs-and-problems.html). They are currently determining requirements and are very interested in hearing from !VOs so they can adapt to OSG's needs. Those who would like to provide feedback can visit the aforementioned web page, which has a comments section and an email address.

One issue from HCC: There seems to be some overhead in banning a VO. 

Derek Weitzel noted that there is a security ticket open, but his sysadmins cannot view it. This is a limitation to the GOC ticketing system. Mine has requested that a method of enabling individuals on a per-ticket bases is created, but it will most likely be some time off.

---++  VOs In Focus 


---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Due to new hardware purchase and reconfiguration, the site CE will be unavailable, possibly until early next year. They plan to add 512 cores. This will enable them to run their 64-bit application, which they cannot run on their current 32-bit architecture.



---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

Almost finished with processing chunks at KISTI. All went well. KISTI is now ready to add another hundred nodes, but they want us to do testing first. 

CDF is now trying to improve performance in getting files back; making progress.

Chander is organizing general discussion on priority and other issues.

Side note: It seems that a method of gathering "lessons learned" or some type of knowledge base would be useful. Marcia will pursue this idea with User Support.


---+++ FERMI VO (Steve Timm)

Nothing new to report.

Steve is working with Rick St. Denis, et. al regarding stress testing.



---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Highest priority jobs wait longest to get free slots. Derek recommended enabling pre-emption and suggested emailing condor-users group. Dan Bradley from Wisconsin is also a good resource. 

SE issue pending from last week Richard was asked to install Pidgeon tools.



---+++ HCC (Derek Weitzel)

A priority workflow completed successfully this weekend--110,000 CPU hours'26 TB transferred; finished well before anticipated. HPC continues to get good CPU cycles on OSG,  ~300,000 last weekend.

Open HCC tickets are being handled on HCC's behalf by the GlideinWMS team at UCSD.


---+++ !SBGrid 

Not present.
