[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Storage/WebHome/GlObusOnlineOverVIEW.pdf][GlobusOnline Overview]] by Tanya Levshina 


What kind of projects should consider this?

   * Requests to move data from one storage site to another.
   * Don't know how moving data from worker node to SE on outside. Need to investigate.

Steve Cox?: a serivce that sits on the submit node would be useful: just register user and register end points w/ globusonline; no need to have a service on submission node. 

Maxim: possible actively looking at for a solution for a PANDA action item: need to be able to move data in a way that's convenient that provides redundancy and robustness. They will be expending effort on this over next couple months.

!glideinWMS 

Marco Mambelli: useful for VO that had data outside a classic grid infrastructure, say, a computer in a lab without a SE installed. globus online provides a simple way to construct and endpoint and submit a job.

Not much for transfer to/from worker node.

Marko Slyz: need a special proxy to use; will this proxy use for regular grid computations as well? Tanya: only needed when doing transfers using MPI or with RFC server




---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ Engagement (John McKee)

Engagement has deployed a new submit infrastructure using !glideinWMS with additional hardware/disk space. The continue to use !MatchMaker in parallel and are moving users over to glidein. So far, so good, but they have not yet stress tested the infrastructure. They  want to do this naturally with users.

Also supporting NEES, who will transfer 1.8 TB between RENCI and UCSD daily.This will definitely tax the system, so they are working iwth thier networking staff and are also interested in globus online.

Engagement is also working with Condor team and Rosetta team at University of Washington on creating a pool to their submit infrastructure; this should be ready for testing over the next couple of weeks.

A significant issue is that there is no out-of-the-box mechanism to get usage information per user going through !glideinWMS; Nebraska has a local solution, but this can't be adopted by Engage. Chander said that Derek Weitzel will be working on such a solution this summer.



---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Nothing to report. The VO group is available for help as needed.


---+++ NEES (Gabriele Garzoglio)
User may makeit easier forthe user
building structures stuided; going to use OSG application, mainapplication. Have anexperience running ; trying to scale up jobs 
user suppport model to engage a new community. integrate app with OSG. eventually, VO stands up with own front end, VOMSRS, etc.


4000 jobs, 6-12 hours each, each producing 1 gb output. Bound by amouhnt of data that can be stored in sratch space. Amount of quota available; initial set of parameters should run in about 4 days. Can run theapp on OSG and have run an inital set with their parameters. Now working on quota issues. obsdrvation is that the communities are limited by the amount of scratch space. This needs to be a discussion in the future. 

---+++ Fermilab VO (Steve Timm)

Nothing to report.


---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Recovery faltered after scheduled downtime; production is partially down.

---+++ !SBGrid

Not present.

---+++ !SURAGrid 

Not present.
