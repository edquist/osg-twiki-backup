[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Storage/WebHome/GlObusOnlineOverVIEW.pdf][GlobusOnline Overview]] by Tanya Levshina 


   * What kind of projects should consider this?
      * Requests to move data from one storage site to another.
      * Useful for VO that had data outside a classic grid infrastructure, say, a computer in a lab without a SE installed; provides a simple way to construct an endpoint and submit a job.
      * Not useful for transfer to/from worker node.
   * No need to have a service on the submit node; just register user and register end points w/ globusonline; no need to have a service on submission node. 
   * PANDA team will be looking at globusonline within the next couple of months; need to move data in a way that's convenient that provides redundancy and robustness. 


---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ Engagement (John McKee)

Engagement has deployed a new submit infrastructure using !glideinWMS with additional hardware/disk space. The continue to use !MatchMaker in parallel and are moving users over to glidein. So far, so good, but they have not yet stress tested the infrastructure. They  want to do this naturally with users.

Also supporting NEES, who will transfer 1.8 TB between RENCI and UCSD daily.This will definitely tax the system, so they are working iwth thier networking staff and are also interested in globus online.

Engagement is also working with Condor team and Rosetta team at University of Washington on creating a pool to their submit infrastructure; this should be ready for testing over the next couple of weeks.

A significant issue is that there is no out-of-the-box mechanism to get usage information per user going through !glideinWMS; Nebraska has a local solution, but this can't be adopted by Engage. Chander said that Derek Weitzel will be working on such a solution this summer.



---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Nothing to report. The VO group is available for help as needed.


---+++ NEES (Gabriele Garzoglio)

Can successfully run their application on the OSG. Now they are working on quota issues. (See activity [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Engagement/EngageOpenSeesProductionDemo ][web site]])

Each run has ~4000 jobs running 6-12 hours and producing 1 gb output each. They are bound by the amount of data that can be stored in scratch space. They plan to try globusonline to move data out of scratch space. 

---+++ Fermilab VO (Steve Timm)

Nothing to report.


---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Recovery faltered after scheduled downtime; production is partially down.

---+++ !SBGrid

Not present.

---+++ !SURAGrid 

Not present.
