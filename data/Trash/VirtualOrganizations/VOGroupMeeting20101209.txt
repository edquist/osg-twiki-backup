---++ Pigeon Tools Tutorial - Doug Strain

Pigeon is a python-based tool for finding working storage elements for VOs.
It will discover storage sites from BDII and then verify that they are
configured correctly by testing them with common SRM commands.  It aims to
simplify finding and testing storage elements.

---++  VOs In Focus 


---+++ CDF  (Rick St. Denis)

Good meeting with Chander, Gabriele and Marko. KISTI may have found its pbs errors; waiting on VOMS update so KISTI cert will be in correct place for testing. 
Re-established communication system. Have a couple near-term action items. Would like CDF to attend forum every 2-3 months; 


---+++ Fermi-VO



---+++ !GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Site ops: Major improvement in overall performance of dcache SE by adding gridmap file rather than relying on GUMS. Put most common DNS into gridmap file; now much more responsive. Joel and D0 should now be all set.

Pilots start up slowly--can take an hour to start up job (SAM calling server to get work). CPUs sitting 50% idle. When able to fetch fromlocal SE, wait is negligible.

Production is running well.

VO submission; pilots now distributed through !glideinWMS; success on site; proxy issue; Jeff Dost and Terrence Martin are in touch. Jeff suggested Richard submit a GOC ticket to update GUMS template. Next task is to run builds on diverse sites.

Marco will send instructions . 

Purdue seems to be running jobs, but there's no way to tell whether succeeded. Could be pilot jobs thrashing. Richard will send with proxy Glue-X job to UCSD for testing.

University had blocked Pigeon tools; placed on exceptions list. What to do about errors in reporting? Open GOC tickets; site should remove GLUE-X support from BDII if they don't actually support their SE.
