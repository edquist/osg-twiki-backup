---++ Introduction
   * Attendees:  Britta, Maxim, Abhishek
   * Apologies: Chris, Mats
   * Coordinates: Sep 13 Thursday, 12:00 noon Central; 510-665-5437, #5555

---++ !IceCube related discussion.
Chris is on leave, so discussion (of this and most other tasks being undertaken by Chris) postponed to next week.

---++ Investigate incorporating !ReSS into LIGO workflow.
Britta plans to look into this.

---++ MPI related discussion.
Maxim mentioned a paper by Mats and team: http://osg-engage.renci.org/papers/OSG_MPI.pdf                                                                                                                         
which used the WRF (weather research and forecast) software as a test case. There are a few action items on the last page in the paper, which Maxim explained as:

a) the submitter environment is curently lost when an OSG job gets dispatched on the target cluster, thus losing the vital MPI                                                                                                            environment variables. This needs to be addressed lest one is compelled to resort to unwieldy solutions.

b) sites wanting to serve the MPI users should actively maintain the (jobtype=mpi) interface which is to be tested by GOC.                                                                                                                

c) sites should advertise all the information necessary for the correct operation of MPI, including but not limited to:  library/compiler location, implementation, RSL. Maxim and Mats have been in contact with the CHARMM group (protein folding), and considered a request from Ana Damjanovic and others regarding running CHARMM on a parallel architecture. They want to explore the SMP approach and then the MPI. Maxim remarked in that regard that our architecture is not suited for the SMP and we probably won't so this step, however Mats was actively working on the MPI deployment for the WRF and the experience gained there should help to setup CHARMM as well.                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                      
Maxim mentioned that plan is to spec out what we can do for CHARMM (Mats' MPI focus remains with the WRF).    

---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo application validation of ITB 0.7.
Discussion about the ongoing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo validation of ITB 0.7. Fermilab VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and SDSS/DES have completed validation, and have formally given a green flag to ITB 0.7. LIGO validation is in progress. ATLAS, !CompBioGrid, Engage, iVDGL, and STAR have kindly agreed to look into the validation exercise, if sufficient resources become available. DOSAR and Dzero may also participate, but we are not certain yet. An extended discussion was also part of the 
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/MinutesSep13#VO_Validation_Jeff_Charles_Abhis][Integration Meeting]] later in the day.

---++ Guidance from Executive Board to encourage SRM adoption by more VOs.
We had received guidance from Executive Board to try include SRM-based storage resources in the curent ITB 0.7 validation, at least for a few active VOs. Our efforts to encourage VOs to do so are in progress. We have received a positive word from ATLAS, !CompBioGrid, Engage, SDSS/DES, and STAR. (For LIGO, please see below).

---++ VOs with under-utilization of OSG resources.
Discussion about working with VOs which may not have made full utilization of available OSG resources in the previous few quarters. We outlined a plan (extension of an action item from previously conducted User Surveys) and requested guidance from members of the Executive Board. <i><u>%BLUE%Update</u>: Plan was found to have practical constraints, and thus, has been dropped after due deliberation.%ENDCOLOR%</i>

---++ Request for LIGO to consider integrating use of SRM (srmcp) in job management workflow.
Abhishek requested if it would be possible  for LIGO to consider integrating use of SRM (srmcp) in job management workflow. Britta has agreed to convey the request to LIGO team, and to look into the technical details if considered a viable option by LIGO management.
