---++ Communications 

Supercomputing09 - please let Marcia know if you will be attending.

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

Focus being redirected onto increasing production activity on OSG. Two key areas: (a) Bringing up ALICE site at NERSC onto OSG Integration Testbed. (b) A new OSG CE at LLNL. 

Gratia accounting at PDSF was down for some time. It has now been reinstated. 

Jeff plans to inform Abhishek if a VOBox provisioned by OSG can be beneficial for ramping up.

---+++ CDF (Dennis Box)

Learned earlier this week of a new proposed date for Kerberos CA server transition; Nov 17 tentatively. Have expedited testing.

A new SL5-only queue is in production on one of CDF portals. This isolates SL5 for evaluation from SL4 for ongoing production. Evaluation proceeding at good pace.

---+++ !Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Implemented GIP configuration changes to advertise subcluster parameters e.g., memory, OS versions. As a practical benefit, jobs submitted to !FermiGrid now match and go to the correct OS version (SL 4 or SL 5). Need to include this in OSG Documentation, to propagate to other sites. 

Have suggestions for !MyOSG SLA, prior to giving approval.

---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Trying to get a new user from University of Arkansas onto OSG. Work ongoing with Engagement.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

!NEBioGrid team recently organized a workshop on GPU Computing. Almost 12 presenters, 60 attendees. Good discussions on how GPUs can accelerate workflows. Slides and details are available at - http://nebiogrid.org/biomed-gpu-workshop-2009

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Site now functional; being used by Engage VO to consume cycles. Next stage is application integration of Virtual Cell.

---+++ !IceCube (offline: Steve Barnet, Juan Carlos Díaz Vélez)

GLOW setup a glidein schedd to port !IceCube jobs for glideinWMS. Short-term plan is to use Squid (not SRM) to minimize failure modes. !IceCube team is porting the jobs. Proof-of-principle glideinWMS basic infrastructure working. (a) To bootstrap, small-scale test jobs were run on several different sites. (b) Now limiting jobs to UCSD. Avoiding more sites. Exercise is using Dan Bradley's proxy which can be mapped to CMS VO on a few sites. (c) Need to start looking into Data/Storage optimizations with Tanya and OSG Storage.
