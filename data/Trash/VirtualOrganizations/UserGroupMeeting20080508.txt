---++ Status of Pending Action Items
   * [CG] From All Hands meeting - make matrix of VO vs Site from VO tests "hello world" execution. 
      * Some thinking to do to minimize work on the result-collection and tabulation side. 
      * %GREEN%No further progress thus far.%ENDCOLOR% 
   * [MA] Work through corrected VO contacts list and start contacting VOs for AUPs and Registration policies, think about VO Security Contact security training. 
      * In progress. 
   * [AR] How do we get priorities and schedules for VO middleware requests? 
      * Abhishek to start a thread next week. 
   * [MR]: to send Ruth an email listing target potential future users.

      * CG has run the dates and tenative agenda by EB one more time before putting out on the usual lists (done). 
      * No feedback so far, need to establish the attendance
