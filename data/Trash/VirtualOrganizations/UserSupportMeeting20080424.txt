---++ Agenda

---++ Status of Pending Action Items
   * [CG] From All Hands meeting - make matrix of VO vs Site from VO tests "hello world" execution.
      * Some thinking to do to minimize work on the result-collection and tabulation side.

      * In progress. 
   * %GREEN% Update from Mine. I will miss today's meeting but here is my update. We completed the templates and sent them to CMS, EDU, Engage, usatlas, osg VOs. Their deadline to fill out the templates and turn them in is May 15th. The template files are on the security twiki page (policies and procedures table.) they are also uploaded to doc db #751 and 753. We almost finished updating VO contact lists and are currently waiting for OIM project to finish so that we can give a copy of our list to the database. We will work on site contacts after the OIM project completes. Since I updated site contacts in last Auguts 2007, we are not in a big rush to get this done.%ENDCOLOR%
