---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ CDF (Aidan Robson)

KISTI site testing is done, thanks to Steve Timm; CDF submission turned back on yesterday and working fine.

Ops center reporting some monitoring reporting issues; traced back to firewall and now fun.

Observed loss of restarts, then MIT had a downtime; currently out for CDF submission; waiting for more details.



---+++ CSIU (Rob Quick)

- Propagated in VOMS. Not running outside IU yet.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Problem last weekend in one node. Firefly cluster apparently ejected from GUMS;  Rob will look into ticket 10282.

Chander: Is production keeping up with demand?

Yes, but could always use more resources. 
Chander is investigating new possibilities.


---+++ GM2 (G Minus 2)

Fermilab sub-VO; FNAL muon experiment; low resource usage. Will be put into the next VO package.

---+++ MAP (Muon Accelerator Program)

Fermilab sub-VO; recently registered; very low usage. Recently had a seminar for new users to do simulations. Will be put into the next VO package.

---+++ !SBGrid
Not present.

---+++ SURAgrid (David Matthews-Morgan, Rob Quick, John-Paul Robinson)

All Hands Meeting beginning next 
Certificate fest, installation fest. GOC resources ava to help; using Engage VO.

Next step: get one or two !CEs. Have site at TAMU they're hoping to use. Mid-to-late-May timeframe to be up and running.
