---++ Announcements 
Abhishek: Thank you to the VOs who gave us their plans, needs, and requirements. There was participation from a large number of stakeholders. The document (OSG DocDB #979 http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=979&extension=pdf) is available for viewing. 

Marcia: [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3377][OSG Storage Forum]] September 21-22 at the University of Chicago. Organizers have invited VO representatives to join the forum and describe their workflow, problems/successes in using storage. This is an excellent opportunity to engage in direct one-on-one discussions.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

D0 is averaging 2 million jobs per week over past couple of weeks.

Joel is hoping to move forward on ticket #9208. The server certificate  template issue in GUMS. Abhishek had said last week that the OSG security team will look into the ticket and provide assistance to D0 as neeeded. The last entry was one week ago by Doug Olson. At that time, Doug mentioned a possible approach towards a solution.
Does D0 need to make a formal request? What, exactly, do they need to request? 


This particular VM was in GUMS a few years ago, but removed because of the security policy at that time. Abhishek will contact the OSG security team to try to move this forward.


Richard Jones asked via email what the status was on ticket #9142 (https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9142). D0 had run into trouble staging files on a !GLUE-X SE. Richard believes he has resolved that issue. Joel will confirm after testing.

---++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

The organizers are starting to put together an agenda for the OSG workshop in South Holland in December. Work on CHEP poster on South American collaboration will be done. The Paleotomography people from South Africa and LTU have been busy, so no work progress.
