---+++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark), and related work with OSG Accounting

   * [[NanohubNotes][Aug 21 discussion]] 
   * Goals: 
      * Understand possibility of different conventions, and thus variations in job accounting; nanoHUB vis-a-vis Gratia. 
      * Try to diagnose causes of low job success rates. 
      * Suggest, and move forward, measures to improve job success rates, i.e., nanoHUB efficiency. Encourage nanoHUB to increase utilization of OSG Facility. 
      * Solicit nanoHUB's citing OSG usage in publications and in scientific results.

Wikipedia article on LHC grid - (see email, 8/28)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHC_Computing_Grid

It begins with this: <br />  "The LHC Computing Grid is a distribution network designed by CERN to handle the massive amounts of data produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It incorporates both private fiber optic cable links and existing high-speed portions of the public Internet." <br /> <br /> Do we keep up with peer-produced grid articles on major peer produced content sites, such as wikipedia? Are we happy with this particular article? If not, do we pitch in collaboratively to make these articles more accurate? <br /> <br />The article does cite the OSG, and there is an OSG Wikipedia article here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Science_Grid <br /> <br />that article has the comments: "Please wikify this article or section. Help improve this article by adding relevant internal links. (June 2007)
