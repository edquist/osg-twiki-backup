---+++ [[VOGroupMeeting20090312][Weekly Forum: March 12]]

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)
Possible bug found; working with Alain Roy and  hope to resolve within next couple of weeks. Jeff will also be attending Trash/Integration Meetings

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)
ITB testing complete. Were not able to do SRM validation but we will work together if a problem arises in the future. Increasing their level of use, but had a couple internal issues this week that lowered efficiency; still looking for more storage. 

---+++ Fermi-VO
ITB testing complete. (There's a BNL issue due to pool count employment, but this isn't a s/w issue.)

No updates on OSG-Teragrid gateway, but actively working on.

---+++ !nanoHUB
Not present.

---+++ CDF
About to give green flag on ITB validation, hopefully tonight/tomorrow. There is an interoperability issue with !FermiGrid that causes an error message, but it is not a serious issue.

No time currently to think about opportunistic storage.



---++ AOB
*GUMS admin accounts:* Abhishek has talked with Chris Green (representing GEANT4); more discussion is needed, including:
   * how sites would enforce this
   * what changes a VO would need to make in workflow

Steve will email GUMS team, Abhishek, Britta, and Chris Green requesting that a 1-page outline of what steps would need to be taken by VOs in order to do this. VOs may then be consulted to see if they want or not.
