[[VOGroupMeeting20100902][Weekly Forum: September 2]] 

---++ Announcements 

Will transition to ReadyTalk


---++ Security (Doug Olson)

The security team will begin testing on the ITB of a non-IGTF accredited CA into the OSG distribution of trusted !CAs
(called CILogon Basic) that uses the !InCommon Federation identity providers.  Please watch your inbox for an email to start that discussion. 

OSG would like to rely on the !InCommon Federation to get credentials, but there aren't any that meet the IGTF requirements.

The D0 certificate DNS entry issue was resolved. The configuration will go into the GUMS template. In the longer term, the team will need to figure out whether data movement and job submission credentials need to be distinguished.
