*Please note: This page will be updated soon to reflect a more recent status.*

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *VO Planning and Science Requirements towards Future Releases of OSG* </font>
   * [[VOApplicationsRequirements][OSG 1.0/1.2 Planning: Requirements]] set forth by stakeholders. 
   * Facilitating VOs' Science requirements to serve as direct input to OSG software engineering plans. 
   * In partnership with OSG Project Management and Middleware/VDT team. 

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *VO Validation of Sites on Integration Testbed* </font>
   * VO application validation of ITB to enable official releases of OSG, in close-knit partnership with OSG Integration and OSG Storage. 
   * Highly structured activity: Each participating stakeholder exercises a stake in vetting, suggesting changes, and approving readiness of an official OSG release. 
   * Statistics from ITB 0.9.x %ICON{external}% OSG 1.0 validation cycle: 
      * 12 participating Science stakeholders/VOs, 7 VOs ran actual Science applications. 
      * 6 VOs participated in Storage validation, of which, 4 VOs in Opportunistic Storage validation. 
      * Coalition of 36+ experts, 20+ from VO communities. 
      * After rigorous validation and active feedback, official 'green flags' toward OSG 1.0 were given by ATLAS, CDF, CIGI, CMS, DOSAR, Dzero, Engage VO, Fermilab VO, LIGO, nanoHUB, SBGrid, and SDSS/DES.
