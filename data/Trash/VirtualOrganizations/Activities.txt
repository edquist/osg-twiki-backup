   * [[JointTaskForces][Archive]] 
   * With guidance from Executive Team, Joint !TaskForces are planned and executed to enable wide-range technical and procedural matters by rallying concerted effort from VOs as well as from OSG groups. 
   * D0-OSG !TaskForce led to significant improvements in overall D0 monte-carlo event production on OSG. 
   * SBGrid-OSG !TaskForce worked closely together to enable SBGrid resource infrastructure and to evolve design and implementation of the SBGrid Molecular Replacement science application, to strengthen each of these to a production-ready level. 
   * ALICE-OSG !TaskForce integrated LHC !AliEn grid paradigm to startup ALICE production on OSG. 
   * nanoHUB-OSG !TaskForce investigated ways to make workflow improvements, and enabled nanoHUB production to higher job volume at higher efficiency. 
   * Geant4-OSG !TaskForce worked to enable and prepare for Geant4's Regression Testing production runs on OSG Facility.
