---+ *Agenda*


---++ VOs in focus

---+++ nanoHUB
nothing major to report.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)
Reports high efficiency; Joel and Brad Abbott, the D0 Council member, speak often.

---+++ CDF
Update from Abhishek: trying to coordinate between Fermilab helpdesk, GOC and the Fermilab SRM development team to make progress. CDF now has what it needs to proceed. The next step is to get a few more sites.

---+++ NYSGrid (Steve Gallo)
As a regional grid, working on appearing as a single entity, not several. NYSGrid is running its own matchmaker and is looking to hire a scientific programmer (prob. ~ 6 months out) to help set up other sites, such as a couple groups doing chemistry applications and a group at RIT doing image analyses.  Using OSG v1. 

Steve can contact Marcia or Anne to speak about accomplishments for news coverage.

Over next 6 monhts, plan to talk to GOC about mirroring some of their ticket management software.

---+++ STAR (Levente Hajdu)
Main work has been on enhancing Bestman reliability. Trying to move more of their workload to the grid (currently about 10% on grid); no current requirements for OSG for wider deployment. Will speak with Jerome to determine whether a task force should be formed early next year to look at improving resources.

---+++ Security  (Jim Basney)
Looking for feedback on draft privacy policy and revised CA policy:
   * Joel sees no issue with privacy policy. 
   * Others can email Jim

Also wondering if VOs have comments on the DOEGrids service.  No problems reported here.  There may be a survey sent.

---+++ Britta on Vacation Dec 17 -- Jan 5
Next week's meeting will be held, and likely, short.
