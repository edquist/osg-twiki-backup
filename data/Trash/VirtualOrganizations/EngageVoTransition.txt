---++ Transition from Engage VO Host at RENCI

Due to lack of on-going funding, we need to transition away from using the Engage VO submit host and related equipment at RENCI.  This results from discussions between John !McGee and Chander Sehgal on March 21, 2012 at the OSG All Hands Meeting in Lincoln.  No firm schedule was established but it seems wise to complete this work by June 30, 2012.

---+++ Action Items
   * Tanya will provide us with a listing of all users in the VOMS along with the group id.
   * All of us need to go thru this list and determine if users are properly connected to groups.  We know of at least one person who should be tagged with the EIC group but is not.  The intent here is to get to a point where we can treat groups as units (incubator groups) and those users who remain unattached to a group are individual researchers.
   * Chander will setup a wiki page where we can track the progress; we will deal with the “in flocking” connections first, followed by incubator groups, and then individual researchers.
   * Chander will contact Dan Fraser to find out who is responsible for Virginia Tech
   * Need to review with Mats whether we can start sending VO incubator (EIC, SLAC Phenom, etc.) jobs via the OSG-XSEDE submit host (run them under VO=engage)

---+++ Decisions
   * Stop building any more dependencies on the Engage submission system at RENCI
   * Frank has agreed that we can re-home the Baker Lab to the UCSD front-end; Mats will arrange the transition

---+++ Questions
   * What to do with OSG-MM which is currently used to provision software into $OSG_APP at the various sites

---+++ Categories to be transitioned along with plans & status

| *Name* | *OSG Staff Contact* | *Plan/Status* |       
| Baker Lab | Mats Rynge | Rehome them to UCSD per agreement with Frank; Igor is setting up a new host at UCSD and will inform us when it is ready - Mats is coordinating the re-arrangement |
| Virginia Tech | Derek Weitzel | Derek rehomed them to the OSG-XSEDE submit host in early June|

---++++ Incubators for new Communities
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody>
| *Name* | *OSG Staff Contact* | *Plan/Status* |     
| /Engage/CICC | Marco Mambelli | deleted - Email sent to members on April 12 by Chander asking if they are still using OSG.  We should delete the group and delete membership for Marco and Kim; for Zhaoya and Poornima leave them in the VOMS as individual researchers not assocaited with any group |
| /Engage/Fusion | Marko Slyz  | deleted |
| /Engage/Fusion/TGYRO | Marko Slyz  | deleted |
| /Engage/LBNE | Jose Caballero | deleted - Per Jose, delete the group and all users in that group; all deleted by Mats on April 11 |
| /Engage/EIC | Marko Slyz | Plan to involve new staff at BNL in this transition; Chander to setup call to transition these users to another environment |
| /Engage/LSST | Gabriele Garzoglio | Deleted group and members on May 24 |
| /Engage/NEES | Gabriele Garzoglio | Gabriele will send email to to users proposing to delete them from Engage; in future they will use vo=NEES which is now available |
| /Engage/pheno | Marko Slyz | Leave as-is for now; check status in end-June |
| /Engage/Oceanography | Terrence Martin | Per Terrence: leave them in the engage VOMS; they are submitting locally at UCSD and running locally at UCSD machinges.  There is no dependency on the engage submit host at RENCI  |
| /Engage/Oceanography/HARP | Terrence Martin | Per Terrence: leave them in the engage VOMS; they are submitting locally at UCSD and running locally at UCSD machinges.  There is no dependency on the engage submit host at RENCI   |
| /Engage/UCSDGrid | Igor Sfligoi | Per Igor: leave them in the engage VOMS; they are submitting into a front-end at UCSD and there is no dependency on the engage submit host at RENCI -  only membership in the VOMS|
| /Engage/ExTENCI | Jim Weichel | Based on name list from Mike Wilde, Mats has created this group and moved those user into this group.  Need to pursue with Mike Wilde and Rob Gardner about next steps. |
| /Engage/VOTeam | Mats Rynge | no changes needed |
