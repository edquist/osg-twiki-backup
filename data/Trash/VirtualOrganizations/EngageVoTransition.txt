---++ Transition from Engage VO Host at RENCI

Due to lack of on-going funding, we need to transition away from using the Engage VO submit host and related equipment at RENCI.  This results from discussions between John !McGee and Chander Sehgal on March 21, 2012 at the OSG All Hands Meeting in Lincoln.  No firm schedule was established but it seems wise to complete this work by June 30, 2012.

---+++ Action Items
   * Tanya will provide us with a listing of all users in the VOMS along with the group id.
   * All of us need to go thru this list and determine if users are properly connected to groups.  We know of at least one person who should be tagged with the EIC group but is not.  The intent here is to get to a point where we can treat groups as units (incubator groups) and those users who remain unattached to a group are individual researchers.
   * Chander will setup a wiki page where we can track the progress; we will deal with the “in flocking” connections first, followed by incubator groups, and then individual researchers.
   * Chander will contact Dan Fraser to find out who is responsible for Virginia Tech
   * Need to review with Mats whether we can start sending VO incubator (EIC, SLAC Phenom, etc.) jobs via the OSG-XSEDE submit host (run them under VO=engage)

---+++ Decisions
   * Stop building any more dependencies on the Engage submission system at RENCI
   * Frank has agreed that we can re-home the Baker Lab to the UCSD front-end; Mats will arrange the transition

---+++ Questions
   * What to do with OSG-MM which is currently used to provision software into $OSG_APP at the various sites

---+++ Categories to be transitioned along with plans & status
