---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

In early December, was able to get reporting going from NERSC & LLNL to OSG. 

Now defining WLCG process. MOUs, etc. 

Interested in providing capacity reporting. Jeff will contact Brian Bockelman or Rob Quick.

Also working on an Trash/Integration testbed at LBNL. ALICE prefers CREAM and asks that OSG support it. 



---+++ CompBioGrid

Not present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Some db issues resulted in a bit of inefficiency, but overall, things are running fine.

---+++ GLUE-X

Not present.

---+++ CDF (Rick St.Denis)

Things are running smoothly at KISTI, but they had a power outage. CDF is ready to do a large fraction of their reprocessing. They have 400 dedicated cores per day.


---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Working on running campus grid jobs between OU and LTU.
Submitting CHEP paper on DOSAR and OSG-EDU.

---+++ Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

In VO requirements sent last year, the VO stated they had large concerns about  getting VOMS 2.5 deployed. No action as of yet:
Steve will get in touch with Alain.


---++ AOB

Chander: OSG staff are working on 5-year OSG proposal and have an internal review in Washington, D.C. next week. Hope to submit proposal to agencies late spring/early summer.
