Planning for All Hands Meeting is in progress. 


---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ ALICE (Jeff Porter)

In early December, was able to get reporting going from NERSC & LLNL to OSG. 

Now defining WLCG process. MOUs, etc. 

Interested in providing capacity reporting. Jeff will contact Brian Bockelman or Rob Quick.

Also working on an Integration testbed at LBNL. ALICE prefers CREAM and asks that OSG support it. 



---+++ CompBioGrid

Not present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Some db issues resulted in a bit of inefficiency, but overall, things are running fine.

---+++ GLUE-X

Not present.

---+++ CDF (Rick St.Denis)

Things are running smoothly at KISTI, but they had a power outage. CDF is ready to do a large fraction of their reprocessing. They have 400 dedicated cores per day.


---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Working on running campus grid jobs between OU and LTU.
Submitting CHEP paper on DOSAR and OSG-EDU.

---+++ Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

In VO requirements sent last year, the VO stated they had large concerns about  getting VOMS 2.5 deployed. No action as of yet:
Steve will get in touch with Alain.


---++ AOB

Chander: OSG staff are working on 5-year OSG proposal and have an internal review in Washington, D.C. next week. Hope to submit proposal to agencies late spring/early summer.
