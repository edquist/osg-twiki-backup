Organizing and forming a VO - Jose Caballero and Terrence Martin

We are collecting all possible information on how to create a new VO. Final goal is to provide for complete, comprehensive and accurate information and procedures for future new VOs. 
We are putting the information we get in this wiki (work in progress): 
  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/NavOsgVO
Any feedback is welcome. 

One of the most important questions, and at the same time difficult, is how to get sites giving support to my VO. 
How did people do this in the past? Only running on the hosting facility? Just hoping that other facilities accept to give support when GOC releases the new VO package? Did someone try to contact directly a site to negotiate cycles?
