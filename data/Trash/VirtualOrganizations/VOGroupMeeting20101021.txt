---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

Rick is the CDF Offline co-leader.

KISTI issues:  CDF is killing PBS because there seems to be 40Hz of queries to pbs from !glideinWMS.  Pbs is crashing every few hours today. They have a cron checking every 5 min and doing a restart.

CDF is trying to figure out:
   * What to tune where. We think we have a file but would like to benefit from other's experience
   * If there is a deeper architectural issue or at least a documentation issue under "how to use PBS" when you go through the OSG installation.

Historically, people weren't using offsite resources, so CDF decided to run production services off site and users can run locally. KISTI site is a priority for CDF.

Gabriele Garzoglio is in Korea after CHEP and will talk to them of experience, service level and such. 

Like !SBGrid (see report below), Rick has seen jobs sitting for 2-3 days. 


---+++ CHARMM (Tim Miller)

CHARMM had some small issues with host certs on the primary file server over past couple weeks, but these appear to be resolved. Tim just submitted the first set of new jobs earlier today.

This project is to run different mutants of certain proteins on the grid, in collaboration with Ana D at Johns-Hopkins; Tim is coordinating and helping with some of the technical issues. Currently about 8 of 17 mutants for the project are running. Tim expects completion of all 17 mutants by the end of November.

Overall, things are not progressing as fast as they'd like, mostly due to holdups on their end. 

Jose Caballero and Maxim Potekhin are helping with internal grid aspects of finding sites, and they've done a good job.

---+++ !GridUNESP (Gabriel von Winckler, Carlos Eduardo Moreira)

!GridUNESP is using its own infrastructure with the OSG middleware.
Have deployed a few new and have a collector, mostly to accommodate users, mainly who are running MPI jobs.  At the end of the year, they will host an OSG workshop and provide more grid training and plan to develop more grid-like applications.

Historically, !GridUNESP has been providing cycles to other !VOs (mainly LIGO and !SBGrid). Changing from Condor to pbs improved average success rates of jobs from 60 to 95%.

---+++ !SBGrid (Ian Stokes-Rees)

Ian is seeing two problems he would like guidance on: Lots of pilot jobs sitting out there doing nothing and jobs failing at certain sites.

He has three sets of numbers that vary greatly:  (1) Amount of time on a job set spent doing computations that complete successfully (2) !glideinWMS reporting of # CPU hours utilized in a job set 3) what accounting says !SBGrid has used of remote resources. Ian will email actual three sets of numbers to the forum mailing list, but is looking for guidance on managing this. 

Are other glideinWMS users seeing this problem?

!SBGrid is having problems at !GridUNESP. The glidein factory keeps sending jobs to pilots going out to sites that jobs won't run on. DAG or node class ads cannot typically be dynamically modified to do this.

Gabriel from !GridUNESP suggests evaluating a site-to-site transfer and offers assistance as needed.

Update: Have web portal set up where users can create a request for a job that will be run on OSG. User fills out short form, clicks submit and if the data/parameters are okay, it does everything except submit jobs to OSG. (One protein structure that had not been identified in 6 years was run through portal and conclusively identified!)

Longer term plans: 

   * Want to do less debugging of problems and more helping end users.
   * Talking with Stu Martin re. globus third-party software 
   * Working on a secure web portal for !NEBioGrid job submission.
