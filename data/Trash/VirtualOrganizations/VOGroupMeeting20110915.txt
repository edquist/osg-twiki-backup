   * changes are planned for RENCI resources that contribute to OSG: Bellhaven (debian cluster) will disappear. A new CentOS based cluster will appear (Blueberry). Bellhaven will be dismantled and the nodes will be folded into Blueberry. New cluster will be a bit larger, but these are all older machines.
