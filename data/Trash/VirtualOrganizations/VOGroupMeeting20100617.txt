[[VOGroupMeeting20100610][Weekly Forum: June 10]] 

---++ Announcements 

We are inviting annual updates to the planning documents - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements.

David and Abhishek appreciate cooperation in sending scientific publications to them; the list will be sent to NSF and will be published on opensciencegrid.org soon.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Nothing to report.

---++ Storage 

We are inviting stakeholder participation in the OSG Storage Forum; at University of Chicago on September 21-22. Meeting webpage is http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceProgram.py?confId=3377.

---++ CDF 

Not present.

---++ !CompBioGrid 

Not present.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Ticket #8710: D0 had jobs being blocked at UCONN GLUE-EX site. Seems the problem is routed in the proxy being double limited due to possible NFS lite configuration), but Joel says that the problem seems to be more than limited proxy at UCONN because globus url copies work, but D0 jobs do these as embedded in SAMgrid code, so when wrapped in this, it's failing. Also, a fractioon of jobs with double-limited proxies at condor1.oscar.ou.edu (non-educated cluster at OU that uses NFS lite) actually succeed. Therefore, problem is still unclear and investigation is ongoing. 

Steve Timm talked to Mine in OSG Security: The way proxies work, double-limited proxy shouldn't work anywhere, so Mine is trying to reproduce the problem.
or Could be due to the Condor configuration - maybe NFS lite working differently than at some of the Tier-1s. Condor delegating proxies to the worker nodes is typical. Horst, Steve Timm, and OSG Security Team are working with Joel to investigate.

Long-term view from Security Team may be requested. Doug Olson will follow up with Mine.

Abhishek reports that Xin from ATLAS is trying to facilitate UTA usage of SE. Said site was down earlier this week and last week but in good shape now.

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

There was a request sent to Xin (ATLAS) and Burt (CMS) to see if the special RPMs CDF requested for Scientific Linux 5 sites can be installed or not.

---++ GLUE-X 

Not Present.

---++ !IceCube 

Not Present.

---++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid 

Not Present.

---++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Kate is in touch with Engagement Team, which is working with Bill the Meteorologist on doing some simulation work.

---++ CHARMM on OSG-VO (Jose Caballero)

CHARMM: a problem with credentials in addition ; not fixed, but found a workaround. The condor submission cluster was down. CHARMM activity has restarted this morning. Next week, should be able to report on which sites are contributing to CHARMM production.

To avoid credential problem in the future and to avoid condor submission shutdown, team is considering moving condor pilot submission from Wisconsin to BNL. Abhishek recommends following up  with Wisconsin group via email.

Question regarding glexec being installed at all sites --may require follow up to find out whether OSG policy requires particular software element to be installed or whether it is up to the site.

Since yesterday, pilot submission supported for new experiment at BNL: Monte Carlo production for the Daya Bay Neutrino Experiment. 
if we move the pilot submission from Wisconsin to BNL the owner of pilots would be Jose rather than Tim Miller.  Steve Timm pointed out that Daya Bay is registered as a VO and has a VOMS server at LBNL. Jose is working with specific members of experiment and would like to run on OSG VO). Abhishek suggests we discuss this further via email. Jose will send a description to members of the VO group. 



---++ AOB

List of submission job errors: Input was provided by VOs Group (D0, Fermilab/FermiGrid, CompBioGrid, NanoHUB, SBGrid, Glue-X, IceCube, Geant4) and LIGO is also included. See list at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/ProblemsEncounteredByVOsDuringJobSubmission

Dan Fraser is following up.
