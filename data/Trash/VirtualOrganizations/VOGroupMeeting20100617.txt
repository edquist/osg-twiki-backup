[[VOGroupMeeting20100610][Weekly Forum: June 10]] 

---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

We are inviting annual stakeholder updates to - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements. Plans and needs of VOs will be summarized and prioritized as input to FY 2010-11 planning.

VOs Group and OSG Communications extend our sincere thanks to stakeholders for sending lists of scientific publications (and for acknowledging benefits derived from OSG in publications). Full collated listing to be included in Annual Report to NSF; and will be published on www.opensciencegrid.org soon. Feedback is welcome - please contact Marcia Teckenbrock.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

VOs Group has requested OSG Security team to look into the issue pointed out by D0, GLUE-X, DOSAR, Fermilab-VO on "double-limited" X.509 proxy certificates. Abhishek and Doug agreed that OSG Policy needs more clarity on support for X.509 proxy certificates that are "limited more than once" by software components. Current support is ad-hoc, based on site batch-system configuration and artifacts in security software. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8710.

---++ Storage (Abhishek - for Tanya)

We are inviting stakeholder participation in the OSG Storage Forum; at University of Chicago on September 21-22. Meeting webpage is http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceProgram.py?confId=3377. 

---++ %BLACK% VOs In Focus %ENDCOLOR%

---++ CDF (Stephan Lammel - offline)

CDF is restarting work on the production expansion plan to use more OSG sites opportunistically. CDF needs SL5, and requires a few additional packages (to be deployed by sites). VOs Group is working to get arrangement with ATLAS and CMS to look into the possibility.

---++ !CompBioGrid 

Not present.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Monte carlo production proceeding well. 

D0 had jobs being blocked at GLUE-X site UConn-OSG. The problem appears rooted in the proxy certificate being double limited due to possible NFS lite configuration. Joel Snow pointed out that the problem may be more complicated. It is likely that D0 jobs embed certificate DNs in SAMGrid code. Also, a fraction of jobs with double-limited proxy certificates at Oklahoma site (which uses NFS lite) succeeded. Overall, problem is still unclear; investigation is ongoing. Steve Timm had consulted with OSG Security offline; Mine is trying to reproduce the problem. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8710.

Abhishek reported that ATLAS team at BNL is trying to facilitate D0 usage of UTA SE. Site was down for a few days, but D0 is encouraged to re-attempt usage there.

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

No major updates this week. Providing assistance to VOs Group on various issues (see sections of CDF, D0, GLUE-X).

---++ GLUE-X 

Not Present.

---++ !IceCube 

Not Present.

---++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid

Not Present.

---++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Kate Adams is in contact with Trash/Engagement Team; working with a meteorology collaborator on doing simulation work. 

---++ CHARMM on OSG-VO (Jose Caballero)

CHARMM work affected due to credentials. To avoid problem in the future and to avoid condor submission shutdown, BNL !PanDa team is considering to move Condor Pilot submission subsystem from Wisconsin to BNL. Abhishek recommended that this needs more planning; to be followed up over email.

Jose asked if GLExec client can be enabled at all sites across OSG. Abhishek will follow up with Alain Roy and Rob Gardner to understand more on OSG policy on GLExec.

Pilot submission is now supported for !DayaBay Neutrino Experiment by BNL !PanDa team. Jose is working with specific members of experiment and is interested in  starting up !DayaBay production as part of OSG VO. Steve Timm and Abhishek pointed out that !DayaBay is registered as an official VO and has a VOMS server at LBNL. Abhishek recommended to keep accounting considerations in view; to be followed up in more detail over email.

---++ AOB

Input provided by VOs Group (D0, Fermilab/FermiGrid, !CompBioGrid, !NanoHUB, SBGrid, Glue-X, !IceCube, Geant4) and LIGO is now included at -  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/ProblemsEncounteredByVOsDuringJobSubmission. As part of next phase, OSG Production team is now looking into possible solutions.
