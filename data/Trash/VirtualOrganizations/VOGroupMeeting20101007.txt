   * [[%ATTACHURL%/gwms_OSG-VO-Forum.pdf][gwms_OSG-VO-Forum.pdf]]: <nop>GlideinWMS Discussion for OSG VO Forum

Q: With the mutliple front ends connected to one factory, how does glide-in handle policy associated with each site at a VO? 

A: whats the priority of pilots when they start? Requests treated at disctinct. If HCC had 100 pilots and SBGrid had 100, each would have 100 job submits.
Scheduling between VOs still handled at site.
Scheduling inside the VO 

Q: How does the factor know how many pilots are submitted to each site?

A: The factory knows from the front-end.

Q: Marco said, besides submitting pilots from factory, if a site is running local pilot submissions, can still use glideins?

A: The front end can report to multiple factories, so a single front end could talk to different sites. Wouldn't recommend doing it. Could establish your own factory if you wanted to.

Dan; for most VOs, we don't want them to have their own pilots. They can, but it's difficult to set up own factories; much easier to set up own front end. 

Burt and Marcos will talk offline. holzman

A stakeholder meeting will be held in a couple weeks and OSG VO members welcome to attend.

---++ CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Still trying to get a couple bioinformatics grid users up and running.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

UConn SE. 

Ticket regarding GUMS template issue is closed, so we assume it is going through.



---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

No updates.

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)



HCC (Derek Weitzel)



---++ IceCube

Steve started working for the Condor team. Not a lot of progress lately on site.

Juan Carlos from user

---++ !NYSGrid

working with a vHUB and HPC2. Not quite yet ready for glideins,
heavier computational usage.




CHARMM has been doing very good; 

Progress at UConn fixed, who will double the access for CHARMM
Ticket open.
