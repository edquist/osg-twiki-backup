---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VOGroupMeeting20090129][Previous week's minutes]]

---++ Stakeholder virtual round-table

   * Welcoming stakeholders to the new year 2009
   * Stakeholder introductions, views, opinions
      * Plans for Science production from grid utilization
      * Needs for storage, workflow, security management 

---+++ CDF (Dennis Box)
Plans to keep making software stack more grid-compliant. Moving everything to use glidein WMS (first portal going into production within a month, second within 4-5 months). Currently looking at the use of SRM in development;  would like to make use of opportunistic storage, if possible. 

Dennis will ask Donatella and Rick if they have requirements for OSG.

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)
Not currently active, but progress is being made; finishing installing their CE and will next work on configuration. Plan to run jobs through !CompBiioGrid, but have no firm details. 

Jeff is the system admin; Ion Moraru is the science lead. Jeff will talk to Ion and email a list of applications and plans to run on the OSG. 

Working with OSG Trash/Engagement team may be appropriate.

---+++ Fermi VO (Steve Timm)
There is an upcoming change in the way users are mapped to the gridmap file. Instead of all Fermi employees automatically being maped, only the various site subgroup users will be mapped. 

Do not have big offsite users, but LHC ramp up will cause CDF and D0 to increase usage.

Current applications: 
MINOS (all analysis, reconstruction & MC simulation done; mostly on-site usage), MiniBoone (winding down), MIPP, Theorists, KTeV (some analysis), !HyperCP (some analysis), !MINERvA (ramping up; some analysis), !NOvA (ramping up)

Requirements for OSG include standard reporting info for MPI clusters as well as reporting of what services are offered (has not had time to look at !MyOSG). 

OSG - !TeraGrid gateway: Steve working to enable Joel Snow from D0; having problems with TG site stability (intermittent problems occuring). Ruth indicates that once D0 is successful, need to register with the ITB & GOC. 

---+++ GRASE 
"Grid Resources for Advanced Science and Engineering." 
Working on getting GPU cluster running; ~62 TG CPU. Will be focusing on research, not acting as a production VO. All users will be running on the local cluster (will confirm with Russ Miller). Will check with Russ on timetable.

---+++ GUGrid (David Cafaro)
Not much going on, as getting users engaged is a problem. Currently deciding whether to join another VO or keep their own. 

Runs primarily biological science apps, mainly serving GU. 

Will talk to Arnie to see if Trash/Engagement team might help. David would like to wait a couple weeks to provide a definitive answer as to whether switch to inactive status is in order. 

---+++ ILC
Not present.

---+++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark)
In the process of increasing job submission; currently working through reliability issues and making slow progress. 

The majority of sites running on look good. 

---+++ NYSGrid (Steve Gallo)
Discussions happening about functioning as a regional grid. Have talked to Rob Quick about the internal infrastructure needed. Want to run RESS & use condor for job submission. Hope to have !MatchMaker and transition to condor submission over next couple months; afterwards will focus on discussions of how to be a regional grid in OSG.


---+++ GEANT4 (John Apostolakis)
Interested in using OSG for regression testing for release validation. Have run on WLCG.

Regression tests of candidate Geant4 releases simulated many different setups of simplified HEP calorimeters.  A large number of observables are monitored and compared to results of a baseline version.   The number of configurations ranges between 200 and 2500 different setups.    Jobs run typically from 2-20 hours each. Several candidate versions must be tested.  Need at least 2-day turnaround on most test batches.  Currently large jobs are assigned about 200 CPUs and take about 3 days. Target is to test each release candidate within 1 day turnaround time for small/medium sets of jobs (200-500 configurations) and 2 days for the largest sets (2500 jobs).  The tests of several successive release candidates must be undertaken during a known 3 week period before the release.   Total run time of 6-8 Giga-Ops years, depending on the issues identified and the resulting number of correction and corresponding candidate releases.

   * mid-late February - early March: first test production
   * April: second test production
   * June & late November: 2 large runs

Need local disk space to all nodes where the previous release and candidate both are stored. 
Would run jobs at concentrated times. Plans to do small test productions at a few sites first, then move towards running at more. 

Would like to start up right away (by end of February) and ideally, use for big production in June.

Abhishek will put John in touch with Executive Team to discuss the overlay testbed.

---+++ OTHER BUSINESS
!IceCube: VOMS problems not resolved. Steve Timm will get local GUMS expert, Dan Yocum, to help.

OSG All Hands Meeting coming up. Abhishek will send email to forum mailing list.

There is an effort to solicit software requirements with an improved method of keeping track of these requirements.

Request for VOs with little activity to please keep in touch and consider working with Engagement.
