---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VOGroupMeeting20090115][Previous week's minutes]]

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ nanoHUB
Status: Things moving forward; a web page showing job errors and details has been created. Based on Abhishek and Miron's request, Steve is adding more detailed site error history to the !CondorG-based site-validation web page. Taskforce sites are ready to prepare for more nanoHUB jobs soon after. Steve will attempt running applications at 4 taskforce sites. Abhishek and Steve reach an agreement that one of the taskforce goals is also to characterize the failures. E.g., a job which is waiting in queue, then re-submitted to another site, should be tagged as different type of failure than a site failure. Work to continue in coming weeks.

---+++ D0
Has had some problems with a new version of an application (now fixed) and a 7-hour outage. The ticket at Purdue has increased success rate, but maybe still room for improvement. The ticket at Indiana is seemingly related to SE, and no jobs are currently running there. LONI1, a Louisiana cluster, has been down for some time. In addition, a few sites are not providing as many slots as in the past. Joel to inform VO Group if more slots are needed, so that re-negotiation can be attempted with site sponsoring VOs .

---+++CDF
Has confirmed to participate in ITB testing.

---+++Fermi VO
Nothing to report for VO itself; 

OSG / !TeraGrid gateway: Steve has enabled Joel Snow (D0) to try out new site; will send info to Joel. Ruth and John Towns ( !TeraGrid ) have had discussions; details are forthcoming. Itanium/64 site at NCSA was not usable by D0. A new Intelx86/64 site may now also be available at NCSA.

---+++ OSG VO
Planning to divide into sub-VOs based on research interests. Alina also plans to review current membership.

---+++OSG-EDU VO
Work in progress; also planning to review membership here.

---+++ SBGrid
Problems with VOMS server causes inability to run jobs at Fermi sites. Have been running jobs at UCSD and GLOW and are looking at other sites to run on. VOMS server problem may be related to a known bug which was fixed in VOMS 1.8.8-2 and was released in VDT 1.10.1n. URL: http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=4247 . VOMS 1.8.8-2 also has a bug due to which the server becomes unresponsive after 8 hours. URL: https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?44936. A new version will be coming out soon -  workaround meanwhile is to auto-restart the server with Cron. SBGrid has not upgraded to the latest version.


---+++ Engage VO
Nothing to report.

---+++AOB
ITB testing is on track. Participating are CMS, ATLAS, LIGO, FNAL, D0, CDF. Others are invited to test as well, and an email has been sent to VOs.

Bimonthly forums for VO Group meeting will be held over next two weeks. Different VOs will be asked to attend each week, so please check [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/Meetings][Agendas]].

Looking for items for OSG monthly newsletter. Articles would be short (no more than 200 words) and cover work that is being done and successes. Ian Stokes Rees will send details on what's been happening with SBGrid.
