---++ Computational Sciences at Indiana University Virtual Organization

---+++ Our Charter

The Computational Sciences at Indiana University (CSIU) virtual organization is dedicated to expanding CPU and storage resources available to researchers at Indiana University (IU) and supporting these researchers in the effective use of them. Many researchers at IU engage in computationally intensive research. Some areas of research include molecular docking, DNA sequence assembly,
electron microscopy image analysis, theoretical chemistry, drug discovery, radiology, molecular genetics and economics. Specifically not supported by this VO are the High Energy Physics experiments already served by the ATLAS, DZero and Gluex VOs.
