---++ Agenda

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow), and related work with OSG Storage 
   * Goal: Try to improve D0's efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility, and declare any final limitations.
      * D0 encounters high job failure rates at many OSG sites. Main causes are SAM remote cache transfer failures, WAN latencies, and related timeouts during data stage-in and data stage-out. It has been demonstrated by D0 and OSG teams that use of SRM-based SE local to a site improves the job success rates significantly.
      * OSG Storage has helped setup new SEs at Purdue and MIT sites. MIT has dCache pool nodes behind NAT. Andrew has found a solution.
   * Ongoing D0 analysis:

   * Recommendation for USCMS sites: http://datagrid.ucsd.edu/opportunistic 
  

---+++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark), and related work with OSG Accounting

      * There is a discrepency between Gratia and Nanohub statistics
