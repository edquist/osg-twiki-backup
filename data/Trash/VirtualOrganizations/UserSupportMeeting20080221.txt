---++ Agenda

---+++ Introduction of Marcia Teckenbrock

   * Marcia introduced herself. She is the OSG News editor. She will be interfacing with us for two initial reasons:
      * User contacts for featured content
      * Issues of particular interest to users as possible future articles.

---+++ All-hands, face to face and workshop(s)

---++++ "Bio" workshop.

   * Almost together; still waiting for confirmation of presentation from CHARMM.

---++++ "General" workshop

   * Would like to have experts available: email floating data before set in concrete?
   * Chris to float ideas and proposed experts by email.

---++++ Face to face at BNL

   * Dates converging on last week of June. Email to users floating the date before set in concrete?
   * Chris: Penelope Constanta can help with setup of Indico page.

---++++ All hands

   * No special discussion.

---++++ Action

---+++ CHARMM / MPI update

   * Ruth has requested people review Greg's TWiki. Mat's couldn't make it today so has done something via email. Chris asked everyone else to review and send email.
   * Aggregator filter is apparently operating in ITB, not production yet.

---+++ Any other business

   * User requirements for OSG 1.0 revisited: Abhishek has sent email to =osg-users=  asking for timelines to be added to requests. One or two vague requirements will also be flagged for clarification. To converge by March 2.
   * Britta's tickets on LIGO workflow problems have been stalled due to local client problems exacerbated by current lack of a formal sysAdmin; things should be moving soon.
   * Chris offered to check at FNAL for help troubleshooting; Abhishek also offered similar at San Diego.
   * OSG 1.0 Validation schedule: Britta will be back from vacation Mar 21.

---++++ Action

   * Abhishek: coordinate collection of new information and ensure timely closure.
