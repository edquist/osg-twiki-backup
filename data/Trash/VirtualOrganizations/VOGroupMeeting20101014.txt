---++ Announcements

Within the VO forum, we would like to evolve into guiding !VOs toward solutions, site issues. Ideas and comments regarding how to evolve welcome: email marcia at fnal dot gov, cssehgal at fnal dot gov.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

As previously reported, the security team is working on a pilot project with !CILogon, a service run by Jim Basney at NCSA. !CILogon issues grid certificates based on authetenticating with the home institution service, specifically institutions that are part of the !InCommon Federation. (200+ institutions--universities and DOE labs--including LBNL and FNAL; there is about 30-40% overlap between !InCommon and !DOEGrids.)

Rather than going through ID vetting as for !DOEGrids, if you are from an institution that is part of the federation, that is used as the validation and is an automated procedure. A short-lived certificate is issued that can be used like a grid proxy certificate.  One of drivers to join is accessing library services outside the university. Also, many institutions are already implementing single sign-on anyway for their internal services.

You need both home login in service and CILogon Cert must be installed at site you wish to access.

Details are available at  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CiLogonPilot2010][CILogon project]]. Contact Doug, dlolson at lbl dot gov for more discussion.

Are there !VOs that are particularly interested? 



---++ Communications


Nothing to report.

---++ %BLACK% VOs In Focus %ENDCOLOR%

---++ CDF (Eric Wicklund)

Upgraded to 7.4.3; CDF is running mainly !MonteCarlo simulations, MIT being the main contributing site.

Chander asked whether there was a plan for using KISTI in production. Eric said that people trying to use it, but jobs are failing. Chander will follow up with Stephan Lammel to find out how big of a priority this is.


---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9142][GOC Ticket #9142]]: Joel said that 100% jobs are failing at !UConn so he has removed that SE from his configuration. 

Richard Jones has tried everything that has been requested and hasn't detected any problems with the SE. (Shows up green in RSV). Richard said that the SAM layer obscures anything meaningful in his logs. Richard and Joel will do further testing after Joel is back from vacation; Richard will send Joel copies of the log files to see if information can be gleaned.


---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9362][Ticket #9362]]: When small clusters of jobs (~200) were submitted to the the !UConn SE, they went through fine, but when clusters increased, Richard started seeing access failures. He traced this to a globus port range variable and increased it to 5000. He immediately noticed that jobs had stopped flowing. Dan will discuss who should work this ticket 

On the production side, Richard has been concentrating on build scripts to install software on sites. Discovering what is already installed and what is required (i.e., Xerxes, Ruby, etc.) is difficult. Dan said that pilot jobs can do this. Dan will initiate discussion between Richard and Igor Sfiligoi. 

Richard noted that the ports are now open at Jefferson Lab, so glideins will be able to be launched within the firewall.

Marco Mambelli: At the Site Coordination Meeting this morning, a presentation was given by Harold Enrique Castro Barrera of the University of Colombia about what they've done in South America, deploying their own grid using the OSG infrastructure.
