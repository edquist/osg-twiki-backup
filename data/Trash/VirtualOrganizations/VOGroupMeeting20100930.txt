[[VOGroupMeeting20100923][Weekly Forum: September 23]] 

---++ Announcements

Next week, Burt Holzman will make a presentation on the workflow management systems !GlideinWMS and !CorralWMS. All are invited.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

There was a serious Linux kernel vulnerability in which one OSG site was compromised. Patches came out last week and most sites are patched. The security contacts for sites should have received email on what to do. Jim Barlow will be following up with sites.

There's a new version of the CA certificate package 1.16,  which should come out within next few weeks. The package contains a new version of the IGTF certificates. 

There is a Galois, Inc. SBIR project to integrate grid and web access. A number of useful discussions between !VOs and Galois have taken place. If you are interested in talking to a Galois representatives, contact Doug Olson (dlolson at lbl dot gov).

Jim Basney is running the NSF-funded !CILogon (http://www.cilogon.org/service) project at NCSA. The project provides a service that bridges the identity credentials generated by the nation’s universities, through the InCommon Federation, to a certificate for authentication to NSF’s cyberinfrastructure projects. OSG would like to begin testing with !CILogon Basic. If anyone in the VO community would like to try to use this, contact the OSG Security team (osg-security at opensciencegrid dot org).

---++ Communications

Nothing to report.

---++ %BLACK% VOs In Focus %ENDCOLOR%

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Smooth sailing! The required change in the GUMS template is being tested and waiting for production. Abhishek believes the GOC is almost ready to make the release.

Richard asked whether Joel's jobs are operating adequately at !UConn site. Joel is satisfied. Richard would like to keep the UConn SE ticket open because he learned that the site's SRM response time is longer than others. 

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

The !MicroBooNe VO has been approved and is now in the GUMS template, so sites are requested to update their templates.

Steve participated in the Galois discussion regarding grid/web access integration.

Abhishek asked whether Fermilab !VOs request regarding a new VOMS-Admin (and therefore, a new VOMS). Steve said there are reports that this is really buggy and there are issues with backward compatibility. It is not ready for the VDT, though there is a ticket open on this.

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

All clusters have been patched for the Linux kernel vulnerability.

The VDT update cycle has still not installed the change Richard requested some time ago. Each OSG configuration requires a hand fix to the RSV probe. 
Steve Timm said that this feature is being tested and should be released within the next week.

Gratia probes are now producing an error; Richard will submit a GOC ticket.

Jose Caballero has raised a concern that some pilot jobs (7-15%) seem to be snuffed out by an unreachable network. (This was also an issue with D0 in the past.) There is an open ticket on this. 

As noted in the D0 report above, SRM response time is very slow at !UConn. Richard is trying to determine why.

Richard hopes to get back to !GlideinWMS soon. Dan Fraser and Tanya Levshina are working with Richard on !Glue-X storage needs. Richard is also looking at his dCache performance. Richard should feel free to email osg-storage at opensciencegrid dot org regarding !gPLASMA questions.

Some pros and cons were discussed of various storage mechanisms: Abhishek said that over time, caching seems to be only way to keep GUMS latency under control. Hadoop's SRM layer is faster, but not as feature rich as in DCache. 

Jefferson Lab has just opened the necessary ports, so sites within site boundaries can reach the OSG. 

---++ HCC (Derek Weitzel)

400K CPU hours this week. Last week, 300K, before that

Collaborating with CMS on Cloud efforts. 

LSST on hold until graduate student returns from vacation. 

HCC is collaborating with the Tier-2 at Indiana to open the ATLAS cluster for testing. 

Derek has created a new visualization for !SuperComputing, which he adapted from the WLCG google earth job submission code so that it monitors OSG as well. 

HCC provided about ~570K CPU hours last week. Firefly provided 384K CPU hours (up from week prior); Prairiefire provided 10K CPU hours. Rest of CPU usage was 120K, of which one-fourth was opportunistic.

---++ !SBGrid 

Not present.

---++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Kate has installed the host certificate on the VOMS server. She asked whether the 64-bit vulnerability requires patching the VOMS server.  Steve Timm recommended that she does.
