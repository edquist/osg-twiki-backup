---++ VOs in focus

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)
efficiency is good; there is a problem at MSU that is understood and should be fixed soon; a problem at SPRACE has been identified and another at OU has been fixed. Currently, aren't running a lot of !MonteCarlo, but this is temporary.

There's an email thread regarding !ReSS. Should we do a priori negotiation asking for a crtain amount of resources or do we act dynamically through a smart matchmaking service like !ReSS? D0 does use !ReSS sometimes. Seems to work well and has the ability to dynamically adjust depending on a site's health and throughput. It is unknown whether it adjusts for capacity, but this seems to be the case. (Joel has talked to Gabriele, who seems to indicate so also.)

Discussions beginning on D0 Analysis; want to have a plan for requesting resources. Eileen Berman is involved.

---+++ CDF
Not present

---+++ Fermi VO (Steve Timm)
Working on new VO package which changes the way VOs are mapped to external sites. GOC is encouraging others to update.


---+++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark)
There has been progress on the joint !nanoHUB-OSG task force; getting to point of convergence. Steve has changed the site validation display so brief pauses are now reflected. Next step is to see whether he can tag jobs that are submitted but that exceed the wait time limit in a different manner. Also, can Steve make some type of error distribution table (Abhishek has sent an example) which gives a quick idea of the total number of errors and frequency for each site?

The next step will be to increase job volume when ready. This is not too far off.

*Multiple gatekeeper on a site discussion:* If a site has multiple gatekeepers on the same cluster, how does it advertise there are multiples? Also, what happens if one of the gatekeepers goes down, but the other is still available?  UCSD (gatekeepers at same hierarchical level), Fermigrid (different hierarchy for gatekeepers), CMSTier 1 site at Fermi, possibly BNL all have multiple gateways.

WLCG availability algorithms and workflows usually consider this as a normal setup, by picking one gatekeeper. This logic increases likelihood of site's uptime even if a gatekeeper suffers overload and breakdown. However, if treated separately, as 2 sites, validation and availability results are liable to be negatively affected if either gatekeeper is down, though the site itself is fully operational.

Multi-gatekeeper handling is an important architectural and operational topic, and we will rely on Sites and GIP groups for a technical solution.
