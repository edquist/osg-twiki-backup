---++ Sites and VOs Policy exchange/SVOPME Discussion (Gabriele Garzoglio)

Have been working with Nanbor Wang (Tech-X) on SVOPME project, which tries to address issue of automating VOs/site communication. Enables site admins to know whether they are really supporting a VO by verififying their site configuration has mechanism to support the privileges/permissions defined by each VO. 

!FermiGrid ITB site fully functional; ready to do small-scale testing by a VO. First, need !VOs to gain input on the policy editor interface and the types of policies listed in tool. Then may do second level of evaluation to see if !FermiGrid ITB supports policies.

SVOPME is different from RSV in that RSV has functionality from a site perspective. SVOPME captures permissions/policies from !VOs.

Effort required for !VOs is relatively trivial; install tools, look over kind of policies, put together a set of policies ~ 1 day; 
Some testing with Engagement VOs and !FermiGrid site.


Abhishek will follow up with Dan & Marco to identify !VOs that may test.

---++ Announcements 

Thanks to all stakeholders who were at All Hands last week. About a dozen at-large !VOs were in attendance.

---++ VOs in focus 

---+++ CDF 

Not present.

---+++ !CompBioGrid

Not present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Had a lot of infrastructure problems last week; fixed SE increased efficiency by a factor of 3; waiting to hear back from Mark@UTA to start tests.

---+++ Fermi-VO

Not present.

---+++ !GlueX (Richard Jones)

Created a new local user representing each VO: Success! Took some time to settle (new !VOs hitting quota limit immediately, so had to make adjustments).

Ongoing issue of worker nodes not having indiv users defined (only head node). Every condor job runs under a generic account. !NFSlite used to avoid pitfalls of shared NFS file system across cluster where jobs land on head node. Doesn't want to change policy.

Abhishek will help Marco find right group (either sites or security policy group) to follow up with. 

!VOs using: Engage, GEANT4, GPN, LIGO, !SBGrid, GLOW

Remaining issues: still need to decide on a scheme for job dispatching (will look at PANDA, MM, !glideinWMS); if there is an obvious choice, input welcome; workload important. Dan will forward link to incomplete document that discusses.


---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Another GOC ticket #8248 on new user.

---+++ nanoHUB

Not present.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Maxim setting up Panda sites. Upgraded one cluster to 1.2; went well, but can't tell that everything's running. RSV says it is.

Dan F will follow up with problem with Florida's configuration (exporting CE install and osggrid environmental variable; different from a lot of other sites.) 

Request for Peter:  Please pull together a list of the problems over past year or so and when/how resolved within the next week or so.


---+++ HCC (David Swanson)
New VO: Holland Computing Center, Nebraska; high performance computing center that has been associated with OSG through CMS and now has a growing number of users; have worked with Engage. Currently implementing VOMS machine; should be finished this week. VO is OIM registered (GOC #8125).


---++ AOB

Jim Weichel: trying to gain an understanding on non-HEP usage by domain. 

!SBGrid mainly structural biology now (90-95%). All users will be biomedical research.
