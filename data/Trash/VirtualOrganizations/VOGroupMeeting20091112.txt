 [[VOGroupMeeting20091105][Weekly Forum: November 5]]  

---++ Announcements 

!SuperComputing: all stakeholders, please send a note to Marcia Teckenbrock (marcia at fnal dot gov) and Kent Blackburn. 

LHC going to ramp up, which will impact ATLAS and CMS sites. If pre-emption rate is high, opportunistic use will suffer; please send us a note right away. Working with OSG team to make joint recommendation. (How will we know if we've been pre-empted? Jobs will remain in site queue for long time without completion; lots of restarts. !SBGrid: Jobs sit in queue for ages, not always clear why.

---++ Content Management/Documentation 

Not Present

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

# of people heard about vulnerability discovered a week or two ago: Globus team determined globus not susceptible to vulnerability. Most likely, there will be updates to !OpenSSL within next month or so. !VOs do not need to take any action. Just do normal security updates for web browsers.

Summary from this week's Identity Management workshop; more discussion about stakeholder req's gathered from survey and meeting. A meeting summary will be available. A couple results: different communities fall into two camps:  (1) current infrastructure is workable and (2) those who think a more usable way of dealing with grid credentials and other methods of authentication needed.

No easy solutions to replace what people are doing using web methods.

---+++ CDF (Dennis Box)

Not present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Ticket on UNL clusters still open: most jobs fail to get files from SE. not much movement; Fermi servers going to SE.
Over 12 Million events in last week. (Record is over 13). Rates of pre-emption at CMS sites? Increase in throughput at Florida; Wisconsin good; MIT: nothing gets through.

---+++ !Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Joel: document on !TeraGrid gateway? No final decision on whether gateway will remain up. Contact with NCSA left and test allocation expired; lack of effort available, but knows D0 interested. !FermiGrid and OSG management need to discuss.

Also, documentation on how sites can more clearly advertise which version of SL they have--hopefully in 2-3 weeks. Could this be extended to other sites' OS Versions? 

---+++ GEANT4 (Chris Green)

Int collaboration of EU: GEANT4 toolkit central to physics simulation software.

Looking to start testing ability to use OSG sites again; Chris moved OSG/GEANT4 !MatchMaker instance from Fermilab to VM at RENCI to handle site availability and auto install of GEANT software. Will be trying to run jobs on test sites over next 2-3 weeks. Machine will be managed on same level as Engage MM instance. ~19 sites to run, total.

---+++ !IceCube (Juan Carlos)
Juan does user-level work. First trial done; now focusing on optimizations. We will follow up with Ben Bradley, Igor & Tanya to help. Another phone call with all parties will be planned. 

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Piotr Slisz, Ian Stokes-Rees)

Last couple weeks, trying to ramp up submissions significantly; probls at a number of sites that previously hadn't had problems.  RENCI seems, Florida, CIT, (3-4 sites previously heavily relied on now having problems). Running 250 jobs currently at Nebraska at 1/2 dozen  sites. rsynch probs, authentication probs. (Long lists of proteien structures to study, each 15K hours of computing; split into 1000 jobs, each running for about 15 hours. Ideally, would have a whole structure study to be completed at a single site (to make sure sites configured properly) rather than spreading jobs everywhere. Probs w/ OSG !MatchMaker. Data/software associated with jobs: application area ~ 100MB; 1PB tarballs used by individual job, pulled into scratch space; will run from 5-12 hours, pair up and send back.

We will look into whether OSG !MatchMaker is the product they wish to use; if so, more supported needed. Think a glidein model will get jobs much faster. Many sites busy next week b/c of bandwidth challenge at !Supercomputing, but Abhishek will bring up at other meetings to develop plan.
