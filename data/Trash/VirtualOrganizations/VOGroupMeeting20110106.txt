---++  VOs In Focus 



---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Overall, things look good. UConn SE working well.

Opened SAM ticket - Fermi gatekeeper to !FermiGrid--jobs don't run.

Joel still has a problem with jobs being restarted at various sites, particularly !UFla. He's seen an increase lately. Marco suggested that Joel  contact individual sites via the GOC to see what their pre-emption policy is and whether they can remove pre-emption.

Richard Jones suggested setting up half the nodes with shorter pre-emption. 


---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Richard is successfully running the first major GLUE-X production through the main glide-in factory. He is happy with the performance (generally running at 5-8 sites).and plans to getting the first novice user running jobs this week or next. 

He noted a few issues he has noted or is investigating: firewall rules make it impractical to run firewalls; if user job has bugs, it produces a ~1GB standard error file--these are saturating the submit host; the last few jobs take longer than eariler jobs (if 70 jobs left, 170 glide-ins waiting). Richard will talk to Igor.

---+++ !IceCube

Not present.
