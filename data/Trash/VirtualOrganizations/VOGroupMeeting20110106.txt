---++  VOs In Focus 



---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

SAM ticket - Fermigatekeeper to Fermigrid--jobs don't run.

Still has problem with jobs being restarted at various sites, particularly !UFla (pre-emption policies) stop thrashing. Has seen an increase lately. Marco: pre-emtion policy causing problems with some of the larger VOs; Joel will contact site to see what policy is and whether they can remove pre-emption.

Richard Jones suggests Pre-emption at site to compromise between local users and others: half nodes set up with shorter pre-emption.

---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

First major GLUE-X production through main glide-in factory. Firewall rules make impractical to run firewalls. Happy with performance of system. Plan to getting first novice user running jobs this week or next. Did not have to do special config; using factory as set up.

Generally run at 5-8 sites.

Have found that if user job has bugs, produces a ~1GB standard error files that saturate submit host.
