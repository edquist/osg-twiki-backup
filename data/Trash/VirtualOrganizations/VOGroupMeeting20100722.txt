---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

Planning for OSG Year 5 has begun (FY2010-2011). We are inviting annual updates this month from stakeholders to the planning document. This will be used as input. so far, we have received input from 10 stakeholders--Thank you! The document is available here: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements][Stakeholder Plans, Needs, and Requirements]]

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Have had some infrastructure problems ("growing pains"). Upgrading code for data handling. Nevertheless, in the last 7 days, D0's production rate was 11.8 million. 

Richard Jones said that lots of jobs are landing at UCONN, but 50% time they are sitting waiting for input files. Joel said the expert at FNAL has this in queue to do. Once implemented, efficiency is expected to be much higher.

---++ !Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Working on requirements. One high priority item is for the VDT team to expedite VOMS-ADMIN-2.5 and also to get data from old (current) version to 2.5. Others are likely to be further improvements to GLUE schema and GIP.

In preliminary discussions to bring in new group in collider physics simulation. Steve is not sure when this group will ramp up. Also helping Auger VO register with the OSG. Their VO is actually registered at EGEE, so VO contact is in Europe. 

---++ !GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Richard invites comments from the OSG and OSGSecurity team regarding the document he has submitted to Jefferson Lab regarding security mechanisms used: [[http://zeus.phys.uconn.edu/UConn-OSG/client-services.html ][http://zeus.phys.uconn.edu/UConn-OSG/client-services.html]]

Several users from IU signed up and tried out VOMRS handshake. 

Richard has asked Doug Olson to become an agent to approve users for !GLUE-X.

Production on site is going swimmingly. 

As mentioned previously in this meeting, a lot of the jobs, after they start, are waiting for data. Richard expects this to improve once opportunistic storage comes into play.
