---+++ *Report from VOs Coordinator* <br> April 13, 2010

---+++ Ongoing general activities with VOs

   * Working with VOs to collect direct input for:
      * Production resource planning (with Production area). Input received from LIGO, D0, GLUE-X, DOSAR, JDEM.
      * Software Enhancement Proposals (with OSG Software area).

   * Starting next cycle of updates to:
      * Scientific publications resulting from substantial use of OSG (with OSG Communications area) .
      * Database of stakeholder plans/needs and requirements, with emphasis on: (i) current production averages, (ii) future production estimates.

---+++ Quarterly summary of At-large VOs

   * *1.* Dzero monte-carlo production remains cyclic and fluctuated with peaks 10+ million Events/week. Production dropped to near-zero for 2-4 weeks; issues localized in D0 submission infrastructure and lack of workload. New application software has restored the average and peak rates.
   
   * *2.* Prepared CDF for SL5 migration; Kerberos CA transition. Used a separate queue for SL5 to keep SL5 evaluation isolated from production on SL4. CDF successfully upgraded new portal to !GlideinWMS; working well. 
   
   * *3.* Brought Geant4's biannual EGEE-based exercise also onto OSG. Ran on OSG in Dec'09; scale was low; major fraction provided by EGEE. Peak 12,000 hours/day; average 2,000 hours/day; but limited to 2-4 sites. Discrepancy in wasted wall hours. 50% wasted in OSG resource-view, 0% wasted in Geant4-view. Reason likely to be OSG-side issue: exit-code discrepancy due to Pilots. 
 
   * *4.* US ALICE's internal plan for a Tier-2 Facility (NERSC/LBNL + LLNL) moving forward; contingent on ALICE funding. Trash/Integration site up, scalability evaluation of OSG-AliEN interface to restart in coming months.
   
   * *5.* Sustained nanoHUB production at 200-700 wall hours/day. 5+ types of nanotechnology applications. Opened some 'end-user' production jobs; 'probe' jobs ongoing as earlier. Accounting based on nanoHUB-view is still not clear; expected only in long term.
   
   * *6.* Ongoing work with SBGrid/NEBioGrid to sustain an increased scale of production. Peak 70,000 hours/day; usage in bursts; average 7,000 hours/day; current average 40,000 hours/day. Achieved milestone of ~3000 simultaneous jobs. Job success rate 30-50%. Using !MatchMaker and Squid; plans are to evaluate Panda. Multiple factors evaluated/addressed; thus, progress steady but slow.

   * *7.* !IceCube started up; proof of principle accomplished in Oct'09. Limited data-access model. Total usage across 6 sites was 4,000 wall hours; 600 jobs at 50% efficiency. Work to integrate and evaluate data staging mechanisms has been slow; expected only in long term.

   * *8.* !GridUNESP started up in Brazil; coordinated assistance and direction from DOSAR/Horst. !GridUNESP researchers submit MPI jobs through full site/VO infrastructure; running on OSG. Intermittent switch/networking/TCP/IP problems.

   * *9.* GLUE-X started up. Local site UConn-OSG functional. Working with Richard Jones to get jobs from other VOs on the GLUE-X site.  

   * *10.* Facilitated NYSGrid & nanoHUB on NYSGrid's new portal; based on HUBzero, an offshoot of early nanoHUB work. NYSGrid's new consortium - http://hpc2.org
 
   * *11.* !CompBioGrid site functional; used by other VOs. Application integration of Virtual Cell expected in long-term; contingent on !CompBioGrid internal FTEs.
 
   * *12.* GPN and GROW have active sites; but scale is moderate.
 
   * *13.* CIGI, GRASE, NWICG valuable partners in Consortium; but science production is moderate. Plans need to be encouraged.

   * *14.* Restarting work with CHARMM team (part of Engage VO); Maxim is coordinating effort with NHLBI/NIH.
   
---+++ Facilitated VO participation for peer Areas

   * !MyOSG SLA public review. Feedback from Fermi-VO, NYSGrid, STAR, SB/NEBioGrid. (Rob Q)
   * Identity Management Survey; and the following Workshop. Feedback from 15 VOs. (Mine) 
   * Monitoring & End-to-end Information Requirements. Partly out of loop; Fermilab-internal coordination. (Burt, Anthony)
   * Preparedness of at-large VOs for SL5 migration of LHC sites.
      
---+++ Current general concerns pointed out by VOs

   * Globus 5's adoption timeline and VOs preparedness.
   * Workload Management solutions and choices.
   * Opportunistic storage availability.
   * Accounting discrepancies - e.g., uncatched/mismatched exit codes, Pilots.
   * Lack of real-time job status monitoring.  
   * Lack of accuracy in advertisement of heterogeneous subcluster parameters.
      * Fermilab VO implemented GIP configuration changes; working on documentation.
        
---+++ Miscellaneous

   * Long-term impact of FNAL FCC electrical power outage/regulation is not clear - Dzero, CDF, Fermi-VOs, (+ CMS). 
   * Preemption/Eviction remains to be fully addressed. Dan F, Brian, Abhishek worked with CMS T2's to enforce Dan Bradley's solution: sites should use <i>LastHeardFrom</i> instead of the more popular <i>CurrentTime</i>. Need more [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/PreemptionHandling_OSG][discussion]].   
   * Possible need for phase-II of Joint Taskforces in coming months: nanoHUB, SBGrid, ALICE.
