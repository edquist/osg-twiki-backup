---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from previous meetings

---++++ Action

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

   * CHARMM question from Maxim -- questions to Mats about how to proceed. Questions about advertising of MPI information.
      * Mats: thinks this could be advertised by !ReSS.
      * Maxim: does remote compilation become feasible when this information is available?
      * Mats: yes.
      * Maxim: places to start working with Ana to get something going?
      * Mats: try Purdue in the short term -- they have an Altix system and !OpenMP; maybe fermigrid going forward.
      * Chris: try to obtain some info on eg latency requirements to ensure parallel CHARMM is actually an improvement over serial.
   
   * Purdue's OSG interface is now operational; JobType=MPI now works.

   * Chris mentioned that Fermigrid is starting to look at this. Mats said that they should talk directly to Preston, but he has an email describing some environment variable-related changes required to jobmanagers. Chris asked Mats to forward the email and he will pass it on to the Fermigrid folks.

---++++ Action

   * Mats and Maxim: discuss offline and with CHARMM on ways to start using OSG MPI resources, initially with Purdue and hopefully moving up from there.
   * Chris: get involved with Fermigrid discussions and try to kick-start something quickly.

---+++ VO validation of ITB 0.7

---++++ Discussion

   * Fermilab VO and SDSS/DES have completed validation, and have formally given a green flag to ITB 0.7. ATLAS, DOSAR, LIGO, nanoHUB, and STAR validation is in progress. !CompBioGrid, Engage, and iVDGL have kindly agreed to look into the validation exercise, if sufficient resources become available. Dzero may also participate, but we are not certain yet. 

   * LIGO, nanoHUB, and STAR have also provided more validation results, which are being followed up with in the Integration Group. DOSAR have prepared an application with which they will start validating ITB sites, the application does not need SRM. Mats said the same goes for Trash/Engagement with respect to SRM. Trash/Engagement VO would expect to have guaranteed space at a site to be able to use SRM effectively. 

   * ATLAS responded last night that Marco Mambelli is working on the validation. 

   * Validation is going reasonably well in general. Problems pointed out till now are mostly operational and site administrators are being notified of the same. An extended discussion was also part of the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/MinutesSep20#VO_validation_status_Charles_Abh][Integration Meeting]] later in the day.

   * LIGO is performing extensive (WAN-based) testing of SRM sites on ITB, i.e., without using (usually LAN-based) SRM directly in the application. Britta asked whether the results would qualify for the SE validation column. Abhishek welcomed this effort by LIGO, and requested Britta to add the results in LIGO's SE column of VO validation table.

   * Britta also asked about !ReSS. Chris responded that !ReSS operates in two modes: either by scheduling jobs for you or by providing classAds that you can use yourself and augment, like Mats does. In general, a DAG submitted to Mat's broker could have its sub-parts matched to different sites. On the other hand, ATLAS matches an entire DAG on one site by submitting the DAGMAN to a site.

---++++ Action

   * Mats: do some more research into DAG handling for Britta.

---+++ AOB.

   * Abhishek mentioned the meeting on Septmber 28th where we should present information on VO issues.

---++++ Action

   * Chris and Abhishek: get together, decide on what to say and who says it.
