---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Since D0's recovery from the prior week's networking and scheduler issues, things have been running smoothly.

GOC Ticket D0 jobs running at Texas Tech are not being reported. They are using a mechanism that is rarely used in OSG. 

---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

A couple tickets open: Pigeon reporting error; no answer in one week. Rob Q. will ping Alex Sim.

Another: UCONN doesn't show up as an SRM in his public pigeon report. Doug Strain is working the issue. 

On the production side, another user is asking for access; Richard is learning how to have an automated discovery process.
At JLab, there's still some that aren't embracing grid; Richard is trying to get discussions moving ahead. Chander, Ruth or Dan Fraser would be willing to provide some background 

---+++ Fermi_VO
