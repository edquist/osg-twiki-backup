---++ Announcements

Chander: If you are planning on attending the [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3627][All Hands meeting]] in March, please register. Hotel rates increase February 15. [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=3627 ][meeting timetable]], [[http://ahm.sbgrid.org/ ][Meeting official site from !SBGrid]]


There is a new [[https://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/certreg.php][certificate request page]] for OSG users, [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGetWeb][Instructions]] with specialized fields. Note: If you do not yet have a certificate and try to access either page, clicking "cancel" when prompted will still serve the page. 


 
Doug Strain: Pigeon Tools are now included with the latest OSG release. 


---++  VOs In Focus 


---+++ CDF 

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Problems last week with VO infrastructure. log area filled up on scheduler over weekend and network shuffle at Fermilab--both impacted production. Doing production on GP Grid. Thanks everyone for help.


---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

UCONN site going fine. GOC tickets for various issues.

Opportunistic storage is being used by D0; Richard sees some offiste traffic consuming some bandwidth; wants to make sure he properly accounts for this in planning. Joel and Brian provided input.

Low level production of !GLUE-X MC code; going well.


---+++ !GridUNESP (Gabriel von Winckler)

Focusing lately on the creating checkpoints for very long jobs, which frequently failed. creating checkpoints helped a lot to improve performance (see further info in long jobs discussion below). 

OSG school in December was very useful.

!GridUNESP has long job submissions using matchmaking (just submitting to local cluster). They aren't using pilots. Does glideinWMS also support MPI pilots? Do you know of any pilot systems that accept MPI jobs?

Brian Bockelman: It depends on what kind of MPI job; glidein only accepts jobs that can run on one node; 

Horst: They are working on this ability for PANDA as well. htpc@opensciencegrid.org is dedicated to running MPI jobs on a whole machine. 

Implementing some sort of pilot system rather than using matchmaking, with the unusual requirements (a) support for long jobs, and b) support for MPI jobs) is current priority.



---+++ !Fermi VO (Steve Timm)
Nothing to report.

---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Work still primarily on HTPC and campus grids; LTU has installed another campus factory and OU will do the same soon.

---+++ Running long jobs without fixed time limits
Marko Slyz & Gabriele Garzoglio requested a discussion on VO's experiences running long jobs. They have a user with earthquake simulation jobs running ~46 hours+ (typically, many jobs don't run at the same time). Tests have generated job disconnects, blocks, or evictions, so they are trying to figure out ways to optimize. Do !VOs have any recommendation of either how to find clusters or knowledge of clusters that permit long job runs that do not have a fixed time limit?

   * Derek Weitzel: Eviction messages are likely from !GlideinWMS;pilots set up so no job will run past 24 hours (configurable through the factory). M. Derek osg-glideinfactory-support or glideinwms-support lists are the best people to ask whether/how it can be done.

   * The disconnection messages are from the site.  A lot of sites have specific limits on how long  you can run.

   * Steve Timm: !FermiGrid's !GPGrid has a week limit for a limited number of jobs. Also, gratia runs reports of what jobs run more than one week.

A larger problem is that there is no definition of pre-emption in GLUE schema (can either set as true or false). Gabriele said that when this user began running, looked in BDII for pre-emption policies, which were only set to 0 or 1--> doesn't tell much (Did the site just neglect to set parameter?)


   * Richard Jones: pre-emption means something different in Condor, A new parameter, like min-job-runtime would be more useful.

   * Brian Bockelman: OSG can publish non-GLUE attributes if a VO proposes them, but they have to be accepted; can email osg-sites to ask.

   * Gabriel von Winckler: GridUNESP has one queue with unlimited wall time. In the process of trying to get users to optimize jobs to a set of tests, one thing that helped a lot was to implement small scripts and send back application checkpoint files periodically and make an automatic recover of a job if it reaches the maximum time.
