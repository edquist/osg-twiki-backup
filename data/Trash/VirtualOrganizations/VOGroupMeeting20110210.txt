---++ For Discussion

Marko Slyz & Gabriele Garzoglio: VO's experiences running long jobs
Earthquake simulation jobs running ~46 hours+;(typically not running many at a time) 
Trying to figure out ways to optimize 
Tests have generated job disconnects, blocks, or evictions.
Any recommendation of either how to find clusters or clusters that permit long job runs. Trying to find sites that run similarly long jobs that do not have a fixed time limit.

Derek Weitzel: eviction messages are likely from !GlideinWMS;pilots set up so no job will run past 24 hours (configurable through the factory). M. Derek osg-glideinfactory-support or glideinwms-support lists are the best people to ask whether/how it can be done.

The disconnection messages are from the site.  A lot of sites have specific limits on how long  you can run.

Steve Timm: !FermiGrid's !GPGrid has a week limit for a limited number of jobs. Gratia runs reports of what jobs run more than one week.

A larger problem is that there is no definition of pre-emption in GLUE schema (can either set as true or false). Gabriele said that when this user began running, looked in BDII for pre-emption policies, which were only set to 0 or 1--> doesn't tell much (Did the site just neglect to set parameter?)
Should make the policy useful for us. 

OSG can publish non-GLUE attributes if proposed and accepting.  

Richard Jones: pre-emption means something different in Condor, A new parameter, like min-job-runtime would be more useful.

Brian Bockelman: Also can email osg-sites to ask.

Gabriel von Winckler has one queue with unlimited wall time at GridUNESP. In the process of trying to get users to optimize jobs to a set of tess. One thing that helped a lot was to implement small scripts and send back application checkpoint files periodically and make an automatic recover of a job if it reaches the maximum time.

Long job submissions using matchmaking (just submitting to local cluster). Not using pilots. Does glideinWMS also support MPI pilots? Do you know of any pilot systems that accept MPI jobs?

Brian: depends on what kind; only accepts jobs that can run on one node; should work with !GlideinWMS; Horst said they are working on this ability for PANDA as well. htpc@opensciencegrid.org is dedicated to running MPI jobs on a whole machine. 






---++  VOs In Focus 


---+++ CDF 

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Problems last week with VO infrastructure. log area filled up on scheduler over weekend and network shuffle at Fermilab--both impacted production. Doing production on GP Grid. Thanks everyone for help.


---+++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

UCONN site going fine. GOC tickets for various issues.

Opportunistic storage being used by D0; Richard sees some traffic consuming some offsite bandwidth; wants to make sure he properly accounts for this in planning. Joel and Brian provided some input.

Low level production of !GLUE-X MC code; going well.


---+++ !GridUNESP (Gabriel Winckler)

Focusing lately on the creating checkpoints for very long jobs, which frequently failed. creating checkpoints helped a lot to improve performance. 

OSG school in December was very useful.

Challenge now facing is trying to implement some sort of pilot system rather than using matchmaking, but we have unusual requirements:  a) support for long jobs, and b) support for MPI jobs. htpc@opensciencegrid.org 



---+++ !Fermi VO (Steve Timm)


---+++ DOSAR (
HTPC and campus grids; LTU has installed another campus factory and OU will do the same soon.
