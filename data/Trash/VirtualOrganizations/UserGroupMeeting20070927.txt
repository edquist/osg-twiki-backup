---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from previous meetings

---++++ Action

---+++ !ReSS status and open discussion

---++++ Discussion

   * Advertising of MPI attributes via !ReSS -- what, how?
      * Gabriele: two solutions:
         * add to ClassAds a la Mats;
         * Agree on global attributes; pass on to GIP group, get effort to implement GIP scripts.
      * Chris: solution 1 not currently within OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's purview; and CHARMM would be one of the first users of this facility.
      * Mats: wider context: glexec attributes. How to get new GIPs into system and reported by ReSS.
      * Gabriele: suggest putting together an initial list of static attributes; and interacting with (eg) William Law (GIP expert) to get these attributes advertised via Cemon / ReSS; then work with first couple of sites to have admins provide the right information.
      * Preston: willing to help; already done a little dabbling with GIPs.
      * Gabriele: Cemon currently ignores information in the "Software" Entity -- would need to be in the "Host" entity to be picked up by Cemon without upgrading Cemon.
   * Gabriele: will be some tests in the ClassAd to check for mis-configured GIPs and bad information -- !ReSS will augment the ClassAd and these results will be able to be displayed on eg an automatic web site.

---++++ Action

   * Mats: start discussion on what attributes to advertise.

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

   * Maxim: spoke to Preston and Mats; awaiting some instructions from Preston, but Purdue is very interested in helping CHARMM use MPI and also SMP on their site.

   * Chris: efforts starting to provide MPI through Fermigrid: much work to do given use of a forwarding gatekeeper and enforced communication methods at FNAL.
      * Gabriele: also some plans to provide small sub-clusters offering low-latency interconnects.

---++++ Action

   * Chris: stay in touch with Fermigrid efforts and provide input as necessary.

---+++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo validation of ITB 0.7

---++++ Discussion

   * Chris: Abhishek had to leave before this was discussed -- will ask Abhishek to put a short update in the minutes.

---++++ Action

  * Chris: ask Abhishek to put a short update into the minutes.

---+++ Open forum

---++++ Discussion

   * Chris announced the first "general" release of his VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-centric extensible testing kit; documentation and examples of output, tests, etc, are up on the project's [[OsgVoSiteTests][TWiki page]. Comments of all flavors are welcome.

---++++ Action

   * Chris: advertise on osg-users and osg-general; provide support and reply to feedback as appropriate.
