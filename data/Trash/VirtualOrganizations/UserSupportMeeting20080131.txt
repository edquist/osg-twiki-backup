---+++ CHARMM / MPI update

<ul><li>From Maxim via email:
  <blockquote><p>In bringing new VO's onboard via Engage or other similar
fora, we need to be mindful of which VOs are authorized on sites
that we select for various tests adn deployment. Case in point
is the MPI effort, where we couldn't start pilot jobs because
these were typically originated from an Atlas account, while
USATLAS VO is not (and will be not) authorized on Lear machine
at Purdue.</p>
<p>I obtained a separate certificate for the Enage activity and
joined the Engage VO last night. With that, I will resume my
testing at Purdue and will report as the results become available.
The Panda config has been updated, and the pilot submission needs
to be adjusted such that originates from the Engage VO.</p></blockquote></li></ul>

---++++ Fermilab furlough
