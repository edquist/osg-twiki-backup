---++  VOs In Focus 

---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)

A planned power outage led to no access for about a week. There was a credentials issue that has been resolved. Also, overcame transfer problem at Fermilab, so processing going smoothly. 

Advice is needed about doing output and processing on OSG using opportunstic cycles: CDF is moving to 8 GB files. Will they hit quotas? There is an OSG policy of 2 GB per batch slot, but this is not enforced. !VOs were asked to specify requirements for running on worker nodes a couple years ago; at that time, it was possibly ~10GB per job, but they probably provide more now. There are default environment variables, and Rick can check myOSG or BDII info for each site.

Planning on getting two portals (NAMGrid and CDFGrid) into one; will have up to 12K slots on one machine.


---+++ !CompBioGrid 

Not present.


---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Production going fine as usual. Steve Timm thinks the SAM problem reported two weeks ago has been fixed.

---+++ Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

Moving machines at Fermilab; nothing else to report.


---+++ GLUE-X

Not present.

---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

VOMS machine is now back up. They have a new computer science user who has been working with Engage doing some work on his master's thesis.

---++ AOB

Marco:All Hands Preparations: Thursday morning, March 10, there will be a session VOs, site administrators, users and resource providers with experts from various areas (Miriam-Communications; Tanya -Storage, Gabriele-User Support; Networking, etc. The session will be useful for those new to the OSG and for those looking to optimize. The  Goal is to help in anything pertaining to job submission. Unique opportunity to find expertise concentrating in one place. People may participate also by phone or Adobe Connect. There will be a web site with more details.

Marco asked for help in getting the word out to users. Marcia will assist.

Marcia asked if there are other items or experts people would like to discuss or hear from at the VO meeting:

   * Steve would like talk to the VDT team regarding plans, especially regarding transition from VOMSRS to VOMS Admin2.5.  

   * Joel Snow wondering how submission of glidein to CREAM is going. Marko: VDT is planning on testing in February. Steve suggests SAM grid developers get involved to change some configurations.

   * Rick: When will SL6 be out on OSG? Marco said the major !VOs will probably stick with 5 for some time.
