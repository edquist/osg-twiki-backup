   * Phone (510) 665-5437, Meeting ID 1111. 

---++ Attending

Kate Adams (GPN), Peter Doherty (!NEBioGrid), Jeff Dutton (!CompBioGrid), Dan Fraser (OSG Production Coord),  Steve Gallo (NYSGrid), Richard Jones (!GlueEX), Doug Olson (OSG Security), Abhishek Singh Rana (VO Group), David Ritchie (OSG Communications), Igor Sfiligoi (OSG Storage), Joel Snow (D0), Marcia Teckenbrock (OSG Communications), Steve Timm (Fermilab), Gabriel Winckler (!GridUNESP)

---++ Previous Minutes 

 [[VOGroupMeeting20100107][Weekly Forum: January 7]]  

---++ Announcements 

Discussions beginning on All Hands sessions; Draft agenda at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/allhands][www.opensciencegrid.org/allhands]].

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Before you can access the Twiki you need to add DOEGrids to your browser's CA list to avoid a warning message.  >> Marcia will add instructions to opensciencegrid.org.

---++ Communications (David Ritchie)

nothing further to report.

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ ALICE

Not present.

---+++ CDF 

Not present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Still waiting for jobs; Release should be out next week. W/ Dan's help, initiated conversations to gain storage resources for D0  Xin (BNL), Mark (UTA); no committments yet.

Dan F: In future of OSG, would be nice to figure a way to provide Opp storage without having to ask every site. Tanya has similar concept called "space management:" have some space on each site that is world-writable; no prior negotiation needed; Abhishek will forward document re space management. Joel's experience will give insight into how to proceed in future.

---+++ !Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

LBNE now part of Fermilab VO. Another new VO:  !ArgoNeut experiment (test of Liquid Argon Neutrino Detectors).

In past, issues in Accounting w/ FNAL and all sub-VOs. Steve believes these have been resolved.

---+++ !nanoHUB 

Not present

---+++ NYSGrid (Steve Gallo)

The first external user running under GRASE (and supported by !NYSGrid) running BOINC to do work on GPU cluster: Robert Engel from LIGO. Capacity of GPU cluster: 57.5TFlops, single precision.

NYSGrid itself: hooking up 2 apps; 2 sites G-p compute cluster at RPI- first target; dealing with security issues at BNL.

Standing up !Hubzero HPC2.org (3 NYS Technology Organization); working on standing up another site, also using !HUBzero, next month.

Heterogeneous VO in terms of users (Computational fluid dynamics, LAMPS application, etc). Need to specify field of science for user to accurately report accounting. Can be set in OIM.  (Steve Timm: Look at Fermi VO or Engage VO for guidance). We will try to sent specific instructions.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Running jobs after retuning; currently looking at results, but so far, see improvement. Can maintain ~ 1000 concurrent jobs. (Ideally, number should be higher.) Bottleneck appears to be in OSG MM; Peter & Ian will send summary of results Friday when they know more.



---+++ !GlueEX (Richard Jones)

New VO; Nuclear physics experiment being mounted at Jlab following 12 GeV upgarde; looking at QCD.

Have one site up with a CE and SE; one user put through 100K hours completed successfully. 400 cores in production. Jobs from LIGO and !SBGrid (1 at a time, not much cpu; maybe probes) have been submitted; don't know if successful.
site (UCONN_OSG) appears not to show up in !ReSS (but does in RSV). Others on call available to help.

Gratia not reporting hours; Richard will open GOC ticket.

Opportunistic hours available on cluster: !SBGrid would use once in !ReSS; D0 interested; !NYSGrid may be interested as well.

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton): GOC ticket #7870; intermittent GRAM errors on job submissions; causes jobs to fail. Working w/ Alain.


---+++ !GridUNESP (Gabriel Winckler)

Failure on gratia probe due to known error in OSG v1.2.3; manually configured; now fixed.
