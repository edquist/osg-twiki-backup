---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VOGroupMeeting20090122][Previous week's minutes]]

---++ Stakeholder virtual round-table

   * Welcoming stakeholders to the new year 2009
      * All Hands meeting March 2-5; Monday, there will be sessions of particular interest to VOs. The URL for the meeting is forthcoming in email.
   * Stakeholder introductions, views, opinions
      * Plans for Science production from grid utilization
      * Needs for storage, workflow, security management 

---+++ CIGI (Anand Padmanabhan)
!"CyberInfrastructure and Geospacial Information; A science VO in the geospatial domain, not a resource provider. 

Has postdoc w/ !TeraGrid experience, trying to run Agent Based Modeling (ABM) jobs (simulations similar to MonteCarlo). Running jobs at 3-4 sites. Has an ITB for testing.

Plans to ramp up in 3-6 months. Will need more sites to run at (may work with the VO Group) but will need no specialized storage. Estimates usage after ramping up at 5000-1000 wallclock hours/day.  

---+++ DES (Nikolay Kuropatkin)
Runs MonteCarlo simulations. Plans two runs of 10-15 days each on !FermiGrid. Uses mass storage at Fermilab and needs no more. Is using dCache and SRMv2 w/ dedicated space. Estimated usage during runs: each job will run 4-8 hours; each job is 1GB; no wallclock estimates.

---+++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)
Making progress on bringing up Condor pools; 

had some interest in collaboration in South Africa last year, but hasn't gotten far. 

Biggest issue now is teaching folks at OU to use the code (MPI apps, running only at their site); Horst will talk w/ Mats regarding extending MPI solution to other sites; hard to find MPI resources.

Planning to validate the next ITB release.  

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)
OSG used primarily for !MonteCarlo generation. Things are going well; a few outstanding issues that are being acted on, no major issues. Running at 23-26 sites. Needs higher allocation at several sites; once the LHC ramps up, loss of slots will affect D0 production.

OSG/!Teragrid gateway update: Steve Timm has talked to Joel and has gotten arranged for some credentials to submit jobs at NCSA. Joel is noting problems and working w/ Steve. 

---+++ Engage VO (Mats Rynge)
Handling storage case by case. Engage is interested in useing the OSG/!TeraGrid gateway after success.

MPI progress: NERSC and others are trying to copy Purdue to get job managers to work. 

---+++ !IceCube (Steve Barnet)
HEP neutrino telescope; 3 branches of use: 
   * filtering data from instrument
   * simulation of particle interactions
   * data analysis

3 applications:
   * ROOT analysis tool
   * in-house filtering pkg
   * in-house simulation pkg

Anticipate simulations will represent most heavy use, which is 6 months away (plans pilot usage within next month). Dependencies of using OSG are internal to !IceCube Will primarily be a science VO, but may later become a resource provider. Has a lot of local expertise, but may work with Engagement.  Abhishek & Steve will get together for MOU.  

Expects to attend this meeting on a regular basis.


---+++ STAR (Levente Hajdu)
Planning on taking simulation and dumping files at site onto local node while doing reconstruction. Can only run at STAR -dedicated sites. 1000 jobs, 23 hours each (raw data: ~1 hour, recon: ~22 hours).  Will first try to run at a virtual cluster; if unsuccessful, will shift to PDSF usage on OSG. All resources are EC2.  Expects need for 16days@50 nodes, 8 days@100 nodes.

If reconstruction can be included in jobs, will increase utilization.

---+++Operations (Rob Quick)
Will talk next week about RSV & MyOSG.
