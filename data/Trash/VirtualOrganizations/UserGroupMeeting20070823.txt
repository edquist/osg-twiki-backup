---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from previous meetings

   * Chris sent preview version of [[OsgVoSiteTests][osg-vo-test]] package to Britta.

---++++ Action

   * Chris: look into SQUID discovery and access at sites.
   * Chris: re-schedule !IceCube discussion for when Juan Carlos and Steve Barnett can attend.
   * Chris: distill the wrap-up items into well-defined issues for discussion with EB.
   * Abhishek: Review surveys to distill action items.
   * Chris: receive email chain details from Lynn and start dialog with application requesters on technical details.

---+++ !IceCube

---++++ Discussion

---++++ Action

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

   * Mats has been pushing MPI a little further and now has a couple of happy users.<p>Next week he expects to give the OSG interface to MPI a run through on initially Purdue and NERSC.</p><p>Aim to make a more general interface for users with similar needs; Notre Dame to help with that.</p>

---++++ Action

None.

---+++ Resource Selection System: status and "users' question time"

   * The Engagement group (Mats) and Gabriele Garzoglio have been having regular monthly discussions on the !ReSS system, its use and other issues such as reporting of sites, etc. The suggestion was made to move that meeting into the wider context of the User Group meeting, and this will be the first such. Questions are welcomed. 
   * Some suggested reading for those unfamiliar with the project:
      * The [[ResourceSelection.%HOMETOPIC%][Resource Selection System TWiki]], including [[ResourceSelection.ReSSUserInterfaceTools][user interface tools]];
      * Presentation on [[https://indico.fnal.gov/getFile.py/access?resId=0&amp;materialId=slides&amp;contribId=1&amp;sessionId=0&amp;subContId=0&amp;confId=870][ReSS]].
      * Engagement: using !ReSS in !CondorG [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/pub/ResourceSelection/ReSSForEngagementVO/Engage_MatchMaking_with_ReSS.pdf][paper]], [[https://indico.fnal.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=2&sessionId=1&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=870][presentation]];
      * The [[https://osg-ress-1.fnal.gov:8443/cgi-bin/main.cgi][ReSS / GLUE schema browser]].
      * Use condor_status to browse !ReSS: =condor_status -long -pool osg-ress-1.fnal.gov | less=.

---++++ Discussion

   * Introduction to !ReSS from Gabriele. CE information reported to central !ReSS and published as Condor !ClassAds.

   * Natural interface is by !CondorG -- interfaces to central collector / negotiator by specifying requirements based on published GLUE schema !ClassAds. D0 does this.

   * Can also use the Condor interface to extract the information !ClassAds to populate a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-specific matchmaker, adding extra, non-standard information to the !ClassAds that it publishes to local users. Engagement does this.

   * Britta -- question about using the system from Pagasus. Also requests regarding accuracy of advertised information.

   * Chris mentioned that the osg-vo-test system interfaces to !ReSS and provided a link to some [[http://user-support.opensciencegrid.org/site_tests/fermilab/20070822_215743/][example output]].

   * Gabriele and Mats moved on to a discussion of the current status. No real change in status, but there is a discrepancy between VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS and !ReSS. Some sites seem to be reporting that cemon is installed but don't end up publishing to !ReSS. Some sites were mis-configured and started reporting to !ReSS after a GOC ticket was entered. Still looking into the issue.

---++++ Action

   * Britta: will investigate incorporating into LIGO workflow.

   * All: report advertising inconsistencies and outages when they occur.

---+++ <strong>Open agenda section</strong>

---++++ Discussion

   * From Mats: I have been encountering an annoyance. Larger VOs (presumably) able to work around it simply by being big but this affects smaller VOs. Some sites suspend jobs almost immediately after they start running, trapping jobs on their sites and running other higher priority jobs in its place. Two sites spring to mind right now:
      * CIT_CMS_Tier2
      * GLOW does preemption; but is reviewing its policy in this area.

   * Discussion of merits of suspension and preemption from the point of view of sites vs users. High rates of preemption of opportunistic jobs render a site undesirable, especially when a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's applications have a high ratio of data transfer (in or out) to CPU time which mitigates towards a longer running time. D0 is encountering this problem in their MC production, and Mats' SOP is to remove the site from his list.

   * Maybe start discussing things like this at the EB level to come up with some suggested "best practices" for sites that will make their sites more attractive to opportunistic users without unduly impacting their higher priority users?%BR%Two suggestions:
      1. Allowing <em>m</em> jobs in any set of <em>n</em> simultaneously running jobs from an opportunistic jobs to run without preemption (<em>m</em> is maybe 20-25 for a medium to large site)?
      1. Forcing users to specify a !MaxWallTime (by using a very small default) and taking that into account when deciding what jobs can be free the threat of possible suspension or preemption.

   * Preston mentioned that his site runs PBS and Condor together, and there is no way to stop a high priority (local) batch job on PBS preempting an opportunistic job running under condor.

---++++ Action

   * Chris: investigate ways of representing the users' concerns in this matter to the facilities group.

---+++ Any Other Business

   * Steve Clark: related to NERSC -- they announced they would accept jobs on 2-3 other systems. Do they require login access?
      * Shreyas: Registration by user still required, with individual certs (community certs aren't sufficient).

   * Abhishek mentioned making a plan to assist VOs which had little or no usage recorded in the previous quarter, and will email a tentative schedule to invite representatives to the weekly office hours. Goal is to help get these VOs started in the ongoing quarter. As noted during the Q2 User Satisfaction Survey, these are COMPBIOGRID, FMRI, GEANT4, GROW, GUGRID, I2U2, MARIACHI, NYSGRID, OSGEDU, and SBGRID.
