---++ Previous Minutes 

 [[VOGroupMeeting20090813][Weekly Forum: August 13]] 

---++ Announcements:

Survey external to OSG re: !Eresearch2020; collecting opinions from all grid computing communities; URL sent out. August 24 end.

---++ Security 

---++ Storage 

---++ Communications 

OSG newsletter about to come out. If people want articles included in next one, send to David or Marcia.

Looking for summer students/interns contributions to the OSG; contact ritchie@fnal.gov.

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ CDF (Dennis Box)

All GOC tickets that were opened regarding pre-emption policy have been answered. There are some sites that have policies that preclude running jobs there. 

Still waiting for software to be distributed locally, tested, then distributed to others.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Some problems with SEs; Purdue: can't get jobs from SE. Changed name of SRM machine; didn't know. Now fixed.
(Info in !ReSS; Joel looked for info in several places but was not able to find it.)

Pre-emption problem mentioned previously will be pursued in next few months; Joel has a list of sites where this is happening; currently, four. This is a policy issue, not an operations issue (so GOC tickets not correct avenue). If site chooses to have pre-emption, it should not drop VOs right away; it should allow jobs to run for a while; different schools of thought on merits of this practice. Sites should advertise policies.

---+++ !Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

Mail went to VO forum yesterday Fermilab KCA certificate changing CA server; name of CA will be different; has been tested, but not in production; will happen  !Fermi-VO, CDF, some DO, ILC, USCMS, DES are affected and are not ready yet. 

Steve will follow up on !Fermi-VO's plans regarding additional resources needed. Which VOs will be affected? CDF & D0 could use general purpose cycles at Fermilab opportunistically and have in the past. Should be more cycles available, and hardware on order. 

---+++ GROW (Jeff !DeReus)

Working through CE issues; some glitches w/ schedulers. All nodes are registered and should be being advertised. A few things to do on SE. 

In long term, still planning to be CMS Tier-3. Plan to open to anyone on grid and people on campus. Jeff is responsible for success/failure of CMS uses on campus. Abhishek suggests longer discussion offline to figure out longer term strategy before committment to be a Tier-3. CPU: couple hundred nodes.

---+++ !IceCube

Unable to attend. Via email, Steve Barnet reported ability to run !GlideIn job and expects more progress by next week.


---+++ !nanoHUB

Not present.

---+++ !NYSGrid 

Not present.

----+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Considering changing jobmanager from pbs to Condor. Testing reinstalling CE using Condor. Production cluster uses pbs, but are flexible. 

Long-term strategy depends: in process of hiring someone to continue development work; since porting science applications is the major point, maybe option to use a few OSG sites. Jeff will talk to Ian.

---+++  !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)
Trying to get MPI jobs working and integrate into Condor job manager. In about 2 weeks will start work on current workflow and should be able to run on the OSG in about a month.

---++ AOB
