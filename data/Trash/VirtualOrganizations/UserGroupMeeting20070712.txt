---+++ Issues from troubleshooting

---+++ STAR

<ul>
  <li>From Abhishek:
<blockquote><p>Wayne described STAR is trying to integrate their applications with 
SRMv2. Also, in recent past, STAR used Fermigrid resources for =PYTHIA=
event generation and reconstruction. This exercise went very well, 
success rate was ~98%. Jobs that failed (~2%) completed successfully 
in the second submission. They got back all staged-out data, as well 
as log files. I asked Wayne if STAR has any plans to extend their 
usage (in an opportunistic manner) to all OSG sites. He said this is 
not one of their immediate goals but he can get more details from 
Jerome Lauret and other members of STAR team. Dedicated allocation of 
CPU cycles for a specified time on Fermigrid was the main motivation 
for this previous exercise.</p>

<p>Wayne said he will be happy to sporadically join our meetings in 
future. In context to an email exchange with Jerome Lauret earlier, I 
explained to Wayne how User Group can be of assistance to STAR.</p>
</blockquote>

----+++ Users' Meeting

----++++ Discussion

<ul>
  <li>From Abhishek:
<blockquote><p>Mats and I discussed that registrants list for the July 26/27 Users 
Workshop has been growing and is a very good sign. Wayne said that two 
STAR representatives are looking forward to attending and speaking at 
the workshop. Mats mentioned he will be at FNAL a few days earlier to 
meet with local colleagues, and to give a few presentations and demos.</p></blockquote>
