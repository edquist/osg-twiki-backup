---++ Announcements:

---++ Security 

---++ Storage (Ted Hesselroth)

Discovery tool will make searches on BDII information server; Main benefit: find out which SEs support their VO and will support srm copy command; lets jobs run on sites that have a SE installed. (allows your job to construct correct commands for the SE it gets assigned to.will add ability to create !ClassAds. There's a  
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationOSGStorageDiscoveryTool][web page w/ instructions]]. Will add README for next release. Feedback appreciated. SCEC (working through Engagement) will be first to use.   Can a VO which runs jobs through !ReSS make use? (D0 uses SAM, which doesn't require specific SE.)

---++ Communications (Marcia Teckenbrock)

Marcia will start email thread on new milestone reached by D0.

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ CDF 

---+++ !CompBioGrid

Not present.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

SEs they were using expired. Some don't use tokens.  Abhishek will get in touch with offline.

Problem with from cache to some sites; now resolved. 

Regarding D0's document for next year's plans and requirements: !ReSS team issue: Confirming GLUE parameters are used for matchmaking.

---+++ !Fermi-VO

Not present.

---+++ GPN

Not present.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Focusing on the infrastructure. Worker node validation status: no more responses; seems to be small issue not affecting many; haven't been able to track down cause. Can Peter and Piotr provide a one-page document about the issue so that it may be conveyed to multiple areas.

Latest plans on VO formulation: contacted a couple people; waiting to hear back; staff change from one group will cause delay until past summer.

Should be running on OSG soon. Will probably use matchmaker for site selection. Prestaging OSG data for storage.
