---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from previous meetings

---++++ Action

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

   * CHARMM question from Maxim -- questions to Mats about how to proceed. Questions about advertising of MPI information.
      * Mats: thinks this could be advertised by !ReSS.
      * Maxim: does remote compilation become feasible when this information is available?
      * Mats: yes.
      * Maxim: places to start working with Ana to get something going?
      * Mats: try Purdue in the short term -- they have an Altix system and OpenMP; maybe fermigrid going forward.
      * Chris: try to obtain some info on eg latency requirements to ensure parallel CHARMM is actually an improvement over serial.
   
   * Purdue's OSG interface is now operational; JobType=MPI now works.

   * Chris mentioned that Fermigrid is starting to look at this. Mats said that they should talk directly to Preston, but he has an email describing some environment variable-related changes required to jobmanagers. Chris asked Mats to forward the email and he will pass it on to the Fermigrid folks.

---++++ Action

   * Mats and Maxim: discuss offline and with CHARMM on ways to start using OSG MPI resources, initially with Purdue and hopefully moving up from there.
   * Chris: get involved with Fermigrid discussions and try to kick-start something quickly.

---+++ VO validation

---++++ Discussion

   * Since last week, nanoHUB and STAR have also performed validation. DOSAR have prepared an application with which they will start validating ITB but which does not use SRM. Mats said the same goes for Engagement with respect to SRM. ATLAS responded last night that Marco Mambelli is working on the issue. Things are going reasonably well in general. 

   * Britta asked a question about SE validation and Abhishek responded that LIGO can put a check mark against what they have right now; and add a note on what they actually did.

   * Britta also asked about !ReSS. Chris responded that !ReSS operates in two modes: either by scheduling jobs for you or by providing classAds that you can use yourself and augment, like Mats does. In general, a DAG submitted to Mat's broker could have its sub-parts matched to different sites. On the other hand, ATLAS matches an entire DAG on one site by submitting the DAGMAN to a site.

---++++ Action

   * Mats: do some more research into DAG handling for Britta.

---+++ AOB.

   * Abhishek mentioned the meeting on Septmber 28th where we should present information on VO issues.

---++++ Action

   * Chris and Abhishek: get together, decide on what to say and who says it.
