---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

Preparation ongoing for Annual OSG Report to NSF; due later this month. Our sincere gratitude to stakeholders who have already compiled a list of scientific publications (July'09 to June'10 cycle). Stakeholders/VOs who are still working on collating publications are requested to expedite. Please email lists of publications to osg-contact@opensciencegrid.org.

VOs Group is expediting our contributions to the document re-alignment initiative. Working closely with Documentation team. We have identified three categories of documents related to VOs Group: (1) Stakeholders Planning and Procedural Documents; directly maintained in VOs Group !Twiki. (2) Software-related Guides on VOMS, VOMRS, GUMS; in Release Documentation !Twiki. (3) General operational documents in the Documentation !Twiki.

On Security team's request, we are encouraging VO managers to evaluate potential use of the command-line based script interface. Documentation is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGetCmd. These scripts are expected to help VO's members to get grid certificate and to import it as a PKCS12 file into web browsers. 

VOs Group's feedback to OSG Security -- A drawback with the command-line based mechanism: It requires an additional overhead of installing OSG stack components using Pacman, unlike the browser based mechanism. End-users are less likely to have access to such centrally-installed software stack. Browser based mechanism is standalone and simpler to operate; it is confusing due to the need to create and remember 3 passwords. Looking for more feedback from OSG Security Team. In particular, for SBGrid. 

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

OSG Security team has found an easy-to-use Mozilla Firefox plug-in that uploads an X.509 certificate into a !MyProxy server directly. The user only needs to select a username/password combination and the address of the server; the tool does the rest. More details are at [[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/12560][https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/12560]].

---++ Storage  (Abhishek - for Tanya Levshina)

We are inviting stakeholder participation in the OSG Storage Forum; being organized at University of Chicago on September 21-22. Meeting webpage is http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceProgram.py?confId=3377.

---++ Documentation Alignment (Robert Engel)

Work continues on improving documentation in !TWiki. Targeting a completion date of August 1. Requesting addition of HTML variables and an overall document-review; Abhishek is looking into it. 

VOs Group is inviting volunteer effort from select stakeholders who have recent hands-on experience with VOMS, VOMRS, and GUMS. Commitment of voluntary contributions received from a few VOs.

---++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

!CompBioGrid will start moving the site components to a new building, this coming Monday. As a result, CE will be on maintenance until July 21 (but should be back much sooner). A new compute cluster will be brought up; the current cluster will then serve largely for opportunistic usage by other OSG stakeholders. Storage capacity will be from 3 TB to 20-25 TB. After a new hire, application integration of Virtual Cell (http://www.vcell.org) is expected later this year. Looking to expand both in resource provisioning and in local campus user engagement. A collaborator at UNLV wants to run an application; discussions ongoing. 

Main team of !CompBioGrid is located in University of Connecticut Health Center. Richard's GLUE-X team is located on the same campus. Richard pointed out that some biologists on the campus are doing second generation sequencing running on GLUE-X site; Jeff expressed interest. Richard, Jeff, and Dan plan to follow up and explore possibility of forming a multi-department Campus Grid.  

!CompBioGrid is willing to work on VOMS/VOMRS/GUMS documentation; Abhishek will follow up.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

No new progress on getting access to Cornell SE. Abhishek will set up phone conference to discuss further with Cornell team. D0 considers Cornell CE/SE to be a potentially beneficial site due to higher batch slot availability.

No new progress on getting access to ATLAS's UTA SE. There is some discrepancy in the DN/FQAN being used by D0's FNAL team and the entries in GUMS at UTA site. Site has decreased its opportunistic capacity over time, so access may not be immediately beneficial.

Richard mentions that GLUE-X site has about 1TB storage available for opportunistic usage by other VOs in OSG. D0 has tried running there, but encountered failures. D0/Joel plan to work through issues with GLUE-X/Richard.

Considering cost versus benefit, D0 and VOs Group will approach GLUE-X/UConn, Cornell, ATLAS/UTA in order of priority.

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steven Timm)

Many sub-VOs in Fermilab-VO are indicating a need to make transition to Scientific Linux 5. 

!FermiCloud discussions and plans are forming up.

Fermilab-VO and sub-VOs are a major contributor to annual scientific publications list. Deadline in this cycle is prior to the Fermilab-VO's Users Meeting; thus, internal coordination is difficult to expedite. Steve is driving this forward as quickly as possible; Abhishek is in loop.

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

GLUE-X site is facing a major problem with failing Gildeins. E.g., when a glidein goes to run second or third job, its socket connection appears to have been dropped, it just hangs thereafter. Each of !SBGrid, GPN, and HCC encountered failures at GLUE-X site in past few weeks. Ticket: https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=8579. Currently waiting for Igor Sfiligoi's return from travel; Abhishek is in loop.

GLUE-X site is offering storage for opportunistic usage by other VOs in OSG. SRM service on dCache is fully functional; looking for specific request from other VOs. D0 is looking forward to it.

GLUE-X hardware may be suited for multi-core/multi-threaded HTPC applications. D0 is also interested in HTPC. Dan and Abhishek will follow up with Richard and Joel. More background is at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/HighThroughputParallelComputing

Doug Olson asked Richard for feedback on the command line interface. GLUE-X users have been going directly to DOEgrids portal. So, browser based mechanism has been satisfactory.

!GLUE-X is willing to work on VOMS/VOMRS/GUMS documentation; Abhishek will follow up. Richard noted that VOMS/VOMRS documentation has been very easy to follow; and is comparatively better than documentation of other software stack components in OSG. E.g., documentation for installing a DCache based Storage Element was not fully helpful. Robert has noted the feedback.

---++ AOB

We have been working to compile a list of problems that VOs are having with job submission. Document is available at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Production/ProblemsEncounteredByVOsDuringJobSubmission. List has now been color-coded as a method of comparing capabilities between Job Submission systems. Please feel free to double check this characterization and to send feedback.
