[[VOGroupMeeting20100527][Weekly Forum: May 27]] 

---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

The annual NSF report is due this month. Thank you to those who has sent a list of scientific publications to David Ritchie. For those who have not, please do this within the next couple of days (ritchie at fnal dot gov). 

Beginning to expedite our contributions to the document realignment initiative (see below).

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Mine found an easy-to-use firefox plug-in that uploads a certificate into a !MyProxy server directly. The user only needs to select a username/password combo
and the address of the server. the tool does the rest: [[https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/12560][https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/12560]]

---++ Storage

---++ Documentation Alignment (Robert Engel)

Work continues on improving documentation in Twiki. Project will be fininshed by August 1.  All VO documents (~50-55) need review and editing, and addition of HTML variables.  Volunteers needed to improve these documents. Do !VOs with recent hands-on experience have any effort to help with this?

Help needed in three areas:
   * VO Group documentation
   * Release documentation (VOMS, VOMRS)
   * General documentation

If so, please contact (WHO?)
---++ VOs in focus 

---+++ CDF 

---+++ CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

Start moving to new building Monday. CE on maintenance until July 21 (but should be back much sooner).  
This means: A new compute cluster will be brought up; the current cluster will then become OSG dedicated. Storage from 3 to 20-25 TB.
Applications for future runs on OSG include a Virtual cell + one more. Developed internally. Plus a protein folding folks. 

Someone at UNLV wants to run an app. Publicity for !CompBioGrid at local campus towards biologists.

Richard Jones says there are folks from his campus doing second generation sequencing running on GLUE-X. Jeff, Richard, and Dan will talk and explore possibility of forming a campus grid.  

Jeff willing to help with VOMS/VOMRS documentation.


---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

No news from Cornell re SE. Abhishek will set up call between D0 and Cornell to try to resolve issues.
UTA SE status: no response. 

UConn site has about 1TB storage available. Joel has tried running there, but was blocked. Will work through issues with Richard.

Joel will try running at !UConn first, then Cornell, then UTA.


---+++ Fermilab-VO (Steven Timm)

Nothing to report on Fermi-VO.

Need to go move to SL5 

Steve is pinging sub !VOs on scientific publications.

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Issue: still stuck with dropped connections:  Glidein runs job, but when goes to run second or third job, seems to lose its socket and hangs. !SBGrid, GPN, HCC all had issues. Should contact Igor Sfiligoi.

SRM service running. When Richard gets a specific request from a VO, he creates a directory for VO under dcache.

New command line interface to retrieve personal certficate. !GLUE-X have been going directly to DOE. Does require additional overhead of having the software stack involved and being accessible to other users. !GLUE-X familiar with using browser.

Richard has a postdoc who may be willing to help with VOMS/VOMRS documentation.  Richard noted that VOMS documentation was very easy to follow. Documentation for installing a SE (especially !dCache) was shaky.

---+++ OSG-VO (CHARMM Group) 

Not present.


---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty / Ian Stokes-Rees)

Not present.

---++ AOB

Dan has draft recommendations based on job submission requirements from !VOs. Dan will forward this to the osg vo forum list.
