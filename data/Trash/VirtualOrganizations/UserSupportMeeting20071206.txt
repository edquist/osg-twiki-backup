---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from previous meetings

---++++ Action

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

Mats has been away on vacation; new user to spin up with.

NERSC-Franklin should have a CE connected to it, "real soon now."

---++++ Action

---+++ !ReSS status report and discussion

From Gabriele:<blockquote>We are still working on a way to advertise MPI information through CEMon, in such a way that does not break interoperability. Tanya has thought of a new configuration of CEMon that sends Software entity information to ReSS: that should not break interoperability (needs to be proven) and we could use the software entity to advertise MPI information.
Is there anybody that volunteers help to try out this mechanism?

We also would like to work with IU to implement a filter at the BDII aggregator. This would allow sites to implement cusom (extra-Glue) information without breaking interoperability. This would address FermiGrid and DZero use cases (also MPI... if we can't move forward with Software, for any reason). IU has not agreed on the effort, yet.

For OSG v1.0.0 we are working on implementing filtering directly at the level of CEMon.</blockquote>

---+++ Gratia status report and discussion

Chris mentioned that the reporting engine had been upgraded in the last month and we are continuing to work on improving the UI and report performance. Static (pre-generated reports) are now available. For comments or questions, please see [[Accounting.ContactUs][the Gratia contact page]].

---+++ Issues to bring up at the Site Admins' Meeting at FNAL 2007/12/12-13.

No suggestions.

---+++ Open agenda items.

Chris mentioned the osg-vo-test package and the daily reports on results for the OSG VO. Nickolai said he hoped to try it out soon. Mats asked whether the report was monitored by anyone to have problems fixed. Chris replied that he was having trouble negotiating with GOC to get tickets entered, even manually. Mats reported a similar past experience. Chris noted that we should get clarification on when GOC tickets are appropriate and when contact should be made direct with the site (and in the latter case, from whence to get the list of site contacts).

---+++ AOB

Chris mentioned that there wouldn't be a meeting next week due to the Site Admins' meeting.
