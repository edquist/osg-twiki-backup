---+ User information for the fermilab VO
The *fermilab VO* (note the lower-case "f" in the VO name) comprises several "mini-VOs", each of which represents a high-energy physics experiment or related project.  The fermilab VO makes use of the groups and roles feature in the VO management software to label each experiment or project as a top-level group.  The groups are then free to create a hierarchy of lower-level groups and a series of roles corresponding to privileges.

---++ User Documentation
The [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][Fermigrid home page]] provides links to a wealth of information, including a [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/user-guides.html][User guide]], which is intended as a start-to-finish procedural guide.  As such, it contains the Fermilab-specific user information, and duplicates some of the OSG-wide information collected in the ReleaseDocumentation twiki area.
