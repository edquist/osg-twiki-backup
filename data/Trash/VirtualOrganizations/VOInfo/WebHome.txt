Welcome to the home of <b>%WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB%</b>. This is a web-based collaboration area for the OSG Virtual Organizations to record their experiences, gripes, whatever. In an ideal future, we ought to get to a point where each VO keeps a public record of their success/failure rate at each OSG site. In that ideal future, we will then provide an easy to navigate way for site admins to see their score, and other VOs to see which sites are worthwhile trying out, and how to go about it.

In the not-so-ideal present, please feel free to use your twiki page in whatever way makes sense to you. We'll reach that ideal future asymptotically, eventually.
