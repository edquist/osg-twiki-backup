---++ Status as of June 27 2006

Actively running two production jobs on fngp_osg.fnal.gov.  Due to
historical reasons, these production jobs cannot be run on other
sites. This is due to the peculiarities of these two jobs, not a
generic issue. !SDSS can quickly start running production on other
sites using different jobs. This was verified some time in the past by
submitting various test jobs to several sites; there is no
list of successful sites because the sites are changing fast and it
was a while ago. !SDSS does not have any other production jobs to run yet
besides these two, and this is why !SDSS is not exploiting other
sites. Planning to expand site utilization in the future, in
particular for Dark Energy Survey image simulations.
