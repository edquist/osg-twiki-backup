---++ Update on September 5 2006

In response to Atlas [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A1=ind0608&L=osg-users][invitation]] to utilize their !OSG sites within 2 weeks of August 31, Bockjoo attempted to install CMSSW at those sites:

<verbatim>
Brookhaven (gridgk02.racf.bnl.gov)
Boston U (atlas.bu.edu)
U Indiana (bandicoot.uits.indiana.edu)
Oklahoma U (ouhep0.nhn.ou.edu)
U Chicago (tier2-osg.uchicago.edu)
UT Arlington (atlas.dpcc.uta.edu)
</verbatim>

CMSSW_0_8_3 was successfully installed at Boston. Indiana does not have sufficient disk. At Chicago, it failed due to apt problem. All the other sites, Bockjoo could not authenticate. He submitted a GOC ticket.

The following 9 T2 clusters are running CMS jobs:

<verbatim>
CIT_CMS_T2
MIT_CMS
osg-gw-2.t2.ucsd.edu
Purdue-ITaP
Purdue-Lear
red.unl.edu
UFlorida-IHEPA
UFlorida-PG
UWMadisonCMS
</verbatim>

In the past week, there have been more CMS jobs due to !ProdAgent submissions:

<verbatim>
Average number of running jobs from all VOs:   1386
Average number of running jobs from CMS:        596
Average number of free Condor and PBS slots:   1696
</verbatim>

---++ Status as of June 25 2006

!CMS VO currently requires !PhEDEx, trivial file catalog (TFC) setup and dCache/SRM installed on
sites. These are generic tools and they are installed/maintained by
site admins. !PhEDEx will no longer be required at the sites after srm v2.2 is deployed. dCache/SRM is required only for T1's and T2's. All sites are required to have CMSSW, a CMS software framework, which is installed in $OSG_APP by CMS.

In the US, the following 8 (1 T1 + 7 T2) sites actively participate:

<verbatim>
FNAL T1
Caltech
MIT
UCSD
Purdue
Nebraska
Florida (2 clusters)
Wisconsin
</verbatim>

!UCSD has recently added another cluster, which is not actively used
yet. Brazilian institutions (Sao Paulo and perhaps others) have
expressed interest in participating in !USCMS T2 activities.

Here are numbers obtained from Monalisa for the seven T2 clusters mentioned above, all averaged over the last week:

<verbatim>
Average number of running jobs from all VOs:   1397
Average number of running jobs from CMS:        214
Average number of free Condor and PBS slots:   1473
</verbatim>

The bottom line is - CMS T2's are mostly serving other VOs.
