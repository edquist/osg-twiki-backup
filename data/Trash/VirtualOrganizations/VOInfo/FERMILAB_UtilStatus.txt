---++ Status as of August 16 2006

Fermilab can run a set of tests on !OSG sites to determine if Fermilab VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is accepted by a site. At the moment, Fermilab can only authenticate on a dozen or so !OSG sites, and half of them are at Fermilab. They are planning to start opening !GOC tickets shortly to address this issue. One of the experimental groups at Fermilab is trying to ramp up their utilization of !OSG sites.

Fermilab is going to discuss who will be their representative for reports to the applications coordinator and !OSG council. They wil try to come up with a candidate before the !OSG meeting in Seattle next week.
