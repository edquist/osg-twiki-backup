At the moment, !GLOW computing needs are less than the available
resources. This will likely be the case for the next 2 months. Then
!GLOW is planning on starting to utilize more !OSG sites. They have been
working on a Condor job router that allows !GLOW users to submit their
jobs with little or no modification, and have them run on the !UW
Campus grid as well as !OSG.

!GLOW applications can only run on sites that support outbound
connectivity for worker nodes. This is true for !USCMS sites and this
is where !GLOW applications run. !GLOW apps have been running on all
!USCMS sites except Caltech and !MIT. There were problems with running
!GLOW apps on various sites; site admins were contacted and in all
cases the issues were resolved. Many sites still do not support !GLOW,
but !GLOW never pushed for support on these sites.
