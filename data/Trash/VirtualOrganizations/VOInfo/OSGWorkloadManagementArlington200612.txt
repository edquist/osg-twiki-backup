---++ Meeting notes

<i>See whiteboard photo attachments</i>

   * ATLAS priorities:
      * Site-local pilot submission via factory
      * startd based pilot
      * Combination of the two: site based factory for startd pilots
      * Security/authentication: certified signed downloads, glexec
   * CMS priorities:
      * GFactory scalability
      * Generic monitoring of glidein factory (GFactory)
   * Near term work program (objective to have as much as possible of the near term plan done at least in preliminary form by March meeting)
      * Igor, Torre, Barnett will produce draft XML schema definition for GFactory monitoring information (Dec 31)
      * Barnett, Torre will pick up (now) Igor's recent release of GFactory to try out and evaluate
         * Initial interest is in glidein factory itself and not the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo front end; Panda has existing infrastructure for that
         * Adapt it to glide into a site for a site-local factory
         * Try it also in the normal usage mode of centrally managing a pool distributed across sites
         * Integrate it into Panda TestPilot scheduler management and monitoring
         * Will initially use it for submitting present-style Panda pilots (ie Barnett plan phase 1)
         * Later use it with startd based pilot when ready
      * Igor will study GFactory scalability, goal to demonstrate 100k jobs/day. Will use submission via GRAM
      * Igor will work on generic VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-independent GFactory monitoring and making data available via to XML; TestPilot/Panda will pick it up via XML
      * Barnett with help from Condor team will pursue startd based pilot (Barnett plan phase 2)
         * Then try it with Igor's GFactory as the pilot submitter (Barnett plan phase 3)
      * Barnett, Torre will integrate glexec based user identity switching in the Panda pilot, drawing on Igor/Condor work; and add certification by checksum signature to pilot downloads
   * Longer term program
      * ATLAS evaluate use of Condor in pilot/job matchmaking via collector
   * Milestones
      * Draft XML schema definition for GFactory monitoring information - Dec 31
      * Initial implementation of GFactory XML monitoring data extraction via XML - end Jan?
      * Meeting at UCSD in March, Fri before OSG meeting
         * Initial results on GFactory evaluation and integration into Panda
         * Initial measurements of load imposed by schedd glidein; impact of running the schedd on the GRAM gateway; scaling behavior
         * Prepare presentation to OSG meeting
         * Next steps

Subject: new condor release with scalability fixes
Hi Todd (cc to Dan & Igor & Miron),

before Dan went on vacation he mentioned that he committed some bug
fixes and scalability
improvements to the condor cvs. I told him I'd get in touch with you
once we are ready
to use it.

We now have a 3200 vm scalability testbed deployed at UCSD, and will in
all likelihood
need these latest fixes in order to go to town with it.

Is there any chance that we can have a release with these things in,
call it a test-release if you like ?
If this can be done, we would need to understand what components of
condor we would need to upgrade
in order to fully benefit from this. E.g., to what extend can we mix and
match the new with older releases.
Maybe we can talk about this briefly at UTA on thursday.

Also, at the meeting at UTA, I'd like to put scalability & reliability
on the agenda, if we have time for it.
This would include:

-> what Igor is planning on doing for CMS
-> what Dan has done/is doing if you happen to know about it
-> Miron's proposal for Jamie to implement a back-off feature in condor-g
   when submitting to the pre-web services GRAM.

Thanks, Frank
