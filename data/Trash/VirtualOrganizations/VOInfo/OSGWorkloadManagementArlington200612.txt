Subject: new condor release with scalability fixes
Hi Todd (cc to Dan & Igor & Miron),

before Dan went on vacation he mentioned that he committed some bug
fixes and scalability
improvements to the condor cvs. I told him I'd get in touch with you
once we are ready
to use it.

We now have a 3200 vm scalability testbed deployed at UCSD, and will in
all likelihood
need these latest fixes in order to go to town with it.

Is there any chance that we can have a release with these things in,
call it a test-release if you like ?
If this can be done, we would need to understand what components of
condor we would need to upgrade
in order to fully benefit from this. E.g., to what extend can we mix and
match the new with older releases.
Maybe we can talk about this briefly at UTA on thursday.

Also, at the meeting at UTA, I'd like to put scalability & reliability
on the agenda, if we have time for it.
This would include:

-> what Igor is planning on doing for CMS
-> what Dan has done/is doing if you happen to know about it
-> Miron's proposal for Jamie to implement a back-off feature in condor-g
   when submitting to the pre-web services GRAM.

Thanks, Frank
