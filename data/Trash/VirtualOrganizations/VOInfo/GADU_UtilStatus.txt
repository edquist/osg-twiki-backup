---++ Status in November 2006

GADU processed a production run during November 2006. 

Information about the sites used and results of their tests is at

---++ Status as of August 15

!GADU has been testing their apps through late July and early August. The new big update has been postponed due to problems with !GADU data on !GADU's side. Still this is a high priority.

!GADU is still unable to stage out their data to worker nodes because VDS tools they rely on do not let them do that. They are going to use sites that do not suffer from high NFS loads due to !GADU staging their data to $APP or $DATA.

---++ Status as of July 6 2006

!GADU runs Bioinformatics tools such as !BLAST, Blocks, Chisel and
!InterProScan on the !OSG and !TeraGrid resources. !GADU runs small jobs (a
couple of hours) regularly and also runs big updates of !GADU data
every two months. These updates take about 7-8 days per tool using
about 1000 CPUs. The last update was done in April-May for 3 tools
(blast, blocks and chisel). The next big update is scheduled for some
time in the last week of July and it should run for about one month;
the workload will increase because there will be 4 tools, not 3. The
following !OSG sites are used by !GADU at the moment:

<verbatim>
 FNAL_GPFARM
 MIT_CMS
 OSG_LIGO_PSU
 Purdue-ITaP
 Purdue-Physics
 red.unl.edu
 UFlorida-IHEPA
 UFlorida-PG
 USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE
</verbatim>

!GADU apps use !VDS for generating and executing jobs on the !OSG sites,
and currently !VDS does not support staging jobs on worker node scratch
space, $OSG_WN_TMP. !GADU jobs write to $OSG_APP, typically an nfs-mounted
directory reserved for applications, not for data storage. This puts a
significant nfs load on some sites and caused some sites to block !GADU
jobs temporarily; some sites don't work for !GADU for this reason. !GADU
needs to work with the !VDS group to find a solution.
