---+ !OSG VO 

The !OSG VO can be used by individual researchers or small groups to get up to speed on using the !OSG and understanding the benefits. 

---++ Current projects

   $ <a href="http://www.charmm.org/">CHARMM</a>: Jobs are submitted through the <a href="http://www.lpds.sztaki.hu/pgrade/"> P-GRADE Portal </a>, following up on the <a href="https://gin-portal.cpc.wmin.ac.uk:8080/gridsphere/gridsphere"> Grid testing </a> as part of Grid Interoperability Now (GIN) of the same.

   $ <a href="http://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube</a>: Currently in early stages of exploring OSG use.

---+ !OSG VO Privilege Information
---+++ Introduction

This section describes the !OSG VO privilege information needed to allow the services within the !OSG VO access to a particular site. Included here is the GUMS and VOMS information that must be in place.

---+++ Requesting !OSG VO Membership

To request membership in the !OSG VO please complete the following steps:

   * Before you begin, note that your !DOE cert _must be loaded into the browser_ you are using to make the following request. If you do not have a grid certificate, then follow [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGet#Web_browser_based_instructions][the instructions here]] to get one _before_ proceeding.
   * Visit the [[https://voms.opensciencegrid.org:8443/vomrs/osg/vomrs][OSG VOMRS server]] and complete the form. 
   * Complete the Institute and Phone Number fields. If the Name fields are not completed you do not have your cert loaded into your browser correctly.
   * Enter "OSG" in the comment field.
   * Read the !OSG Usage Rules below and click "I have read and agree to the VO's Usage Rules".
   * You will receive an email confirmation, follow the link in the email.
   * Once this is done the !VOMS administrator will confirm your membership with the appropriate VO representative and let you know when you have been added.
   * Select your group and role(s). <strong>Please</strong> do not select a subgroup if it is not appropriate to you (eg =/osg/IceCube= if you are not an !IceCube member).

---+++ !OSG VO Usage Rules

The purpose of the !OSG VO is to provide standard services to experiments that do not have the resources to provide their own.

   * !OSG Usage Policy - !OSG VO users agree to the !OSG Usage Policy located here.
   * Action Within the Scope of !OSG - Users will not use the !OSG VO to run VO applications that are directly related to an existing VO.
   * Incident Reporting - If a machine containing the credentials for a user is compromised the administrator of that service agrees to contact the !OSG-GOC at goc@opensciencegrid.org

---+ !OSG Resource Allocations
While most resources connected on !OSG are allocated directly by agreements between the VOs and the resource providers
there are some resources which are allocated to !OSG.  The use and access of these resources is managed by the !OSG VO.
See OSGResourceAllocations for details.
