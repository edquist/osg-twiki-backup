---+ !OSG VO 

The !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo can be used by individual researchers or small groups to get up to speed on using the !OSG and understanding the benefits. 

---++ Current projects

   $ <a href="http://www.charmm.org/">CHARMM</a>: Jobs are submitted through the <a href="http://www.lpds.sztaki.hu/pgrade/"> P-GRADE Portal </a>, following up on the <a href="https://gin-portal.cpc.wmin.ac.uk:8080/gridsphere/gridsphere"> Grid testing </a> as part of Grid Interoperability Now (GIN) of the same.

This section describes the !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo privilege information needed to allow the services within the !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo access to a particular site. Included here is the GUMS and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS information that must be in place.

---+++ Requesting !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Membership

To request membership in the !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo please complete the following steps:

   * Before you begin, note that your !DOE cert _must be loaded into the browser_ you are using to make the following request. If you do not have a grid certificate, then follow [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateGet#Web_browser_based_instructions][the instructions here]] to get one _before_ proceeding.
   * Visit the [[https://voms.opensciencegrid.org:8443/vomrs/osg/vomrs][OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS server]] and complete the form. 
   * Complete the Institute and Phone Number fields. If the Name fields are not completed you do not have your cert loaded into your browser correctly.
   * Enter "OSG" in the comment field.
   * Read the !OSG Usage Rules below and click "I have read and agree to the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's Usage Rules".
   * You will receive an email confirmation, follow the link in the email.
   * Once this is done the !VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS administrator will confirm your membership with the appropriate VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo representative and let you know when you have been added.
   * Select your group and role(s). <strong>Please</strong> do not select a subgroup if it is not appropriate to you (eg =/osg/IceCube= if you are not an !IceCube member).

---+++ !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Usage Rules

The purpose of the !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is to provide standard services to experiments that do not have the resources to provide their own.

   * !OSG Usage Policy - !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo users agree to the !OSG Usage Policy located here.
   * Action Within the Scope of !OSG - Users will not use the !OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to run VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo applications that are directly related to an existing VO.
   * Incident Reporting - If a machine containing the credentials for a user is compromised the administrator of that service agrees to contact the !OSG-GOC at goc@opensciencegrid.org

---+ !OSG Resource Allocations
While most resources connected on !OSG are allocated directly by agreements between the VOs and the resource providers
there are some resources which are allocated to !OSG.  The use and access of these resources is managed by the !OSG VO.
See OSGResourceAllocations for details.
