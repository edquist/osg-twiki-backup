 Dear colleagues,

 I am pleased to announce that the combined Computing, Software, and
 Analysis challenge of 2006 launched this week on Monday. This is a  major
 exercise to demonstrate the workflow of the CMS data handling  model at
 25% of the capacity needed for operations in 2008. The exercise  utilizes
 entirely new software components written in CMSSW and is conducted  using
 new production tools. More then 50M events have been simulated in
 advance as input for the challenge.

 In the first 48 hours, 8M events were processed by the Tier-0 centre
 (50 Hz prompt reconstruction) and data was exported to all 7
 participating Tier-1 centres at an average rate of 50MB/s. The  launch of
 CSA06 has been orchestrated in a staged manner with the  reconstruction
 of minbias events beginning this week, followed by the  reconstruction of
 more complex events and with increased Tier-0 workflow beginning next
 week. In total the challenge should last approximately 6 weeks,  during
 which reconstructed events should be accessible to physics analyses
 running at the Tier-1 and Tier-2 centres.

 As a word of caution, the Tier-0 component of the CSA exercise will
 utilize significant computing resources from the CMS allocation of
 computers at CERN. The lxbatch facility for CMS, for example, will be
 reduced to about 25% during this challenge. Any conflicts with other
 critical activities should be reported to the CSA coordinator,  Darin Acosta.

 General information regarding the CSA and its current status can be
 found at: https://uimon.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/CSA06

 Regards,
          Darin Acosta
