---+ !OSG Consortium Seattle Meeting: Users Group Parallel Session

This is an informal meeting with a few talks scheduled and hopefully active discussion filling the rest of the allocated 1.5 hours.

---++ Topics for discussion

   * What makes it difficult for VOs to run jobs on !OSG sites?
   * How can VOs provide efficient feedback about these problems?
   * Are VOs well represented at the Operations [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Operations/ProductionMeetingMinutes][meetings]] and in the applications coordinator [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/WebHome][reports]]? 

---++ Preliminary Agenda

Times are approximate.

---++ Notes

(Mostly questions/comments/info not included in the slides above.)

---+++ Torre: !OSG extensions

Major directions for extensions:

   * Data storage and access management
  - !SRM as basis with a list of supported front ends
  - focus on !SRM/dCache in the near term
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo specific services
   * Advanced workload management 
  - Panda in Atlas, !GlideCAF in !CMS, need a generic !OSG workload manager
  - Cutting on failures, latencies; a system that reduces management
    time
   * Security
   * Networks integration (not funded thru !OSG)

---+++ Ajit: !MC !CMS Production

Question from M. Miller: How do you install? Thru a submitted job run by 
an account with special user priorities. Make sure all necessary 
libraries are there.

---+++ Kent: !LIGO experiences

!OSG sites take 1% of !LIGO jobs overall, 99% on !LIGO own grid. 35k jobs 
per year on !OSG. !DAG failure rate is fairly small. Not inconsistent with what other !OSG 
sites are experiencing. Memory goes up to 2-3 GB; depends on how noisy 
the data are. All apps are 32-bit. Submit ~20k !DAGs at once, each runs 
~5 mins. At the moment !DAG runs on a single !OSG site; ideally, they 
would want to submit !DAGs to different sites. If had space, could reduce 
20k !DAGs to 10k !DAGs.

Why no cycles at Fermilab? (question from Steve Timm). Fermilab has been 
supporting !LIGO for a while. Kent (quoting David Meyers) says no cycles 
for a week.

---+++Michael Miller: !STAR experiences

!STAR jobs are confined to !STAR sites. Analysis users are not going to 
start utilize !OSG soon. !MC production will likely need other !OSG sites. 
A group of 10 postdoc sand students need 1-2 TB disk space.

!STAR heavily relying on !SRM for data transfer; started submissions to 
!PDSF from !BNL using condor-g.

---+++ Maytal: !TACC

They have a computational biology VO. Major obstacle to running on !OSG 
sites: There is a learning curve for scientists. !TACC has a big !TeraGrid 
site. Every new user has to request allocation. !CDF and !LIGO have 
allocations. !LIGO has been using them, !CDF can't (wrong !OS). !UT medical 
center could run jobs on !OSG but they are not familiar with grid 
computing. Miron: If a user can submit locally, what exactly is the 
problem with submiting to grid? Can make it very transparent to users.
