The !OSG EDU VO &mdash; sponsored by the [[Education.WebHome][OSG Education, Outreach and Training group]] (EOT) &mdash; includes a wiki, email lists, follow-up discussions and other helpful tools to support instructors in using the OSG in your classes. EOT staff will work with you to find the right way to get your students engaged in the OSG. We also post learning and other grid-related opportunities for students.

Everyone that has completed one of our [[Education.WebHome][training workshops]] is encouraged to become an active part of the !OSGEDU community. The DOE certificate received during the workshop allows  usage of the !OSGEDU resources, and even more. If you haven't attended any of our training events, but you are interested in  joining the !OSGEDU VO, please send a message to *eot@opensciencegrid.org*. _[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000072][Learn more about the OSG Education, Outreach & Training group]]._
