The !OSG EDU VO &mdash; sponsored by the [[Education.WebHome][OSG Education, Outreach and Training group]] (EOT) &mdash; includes a wiki, email lists, follow-up discussions and other helpful tools to support instructors in using the OSG in their classes. EOT staff will work with you to find the right way to get your students engaged in the OSG. We also announce learning and other grid-related opportunities for students through our dedicated mailing list.

Everyone that has completed one of our [[Education.WebHome][training workshops]] is encouraged to become an active part of the !OSGEDU community. The DOE certificate allows usage of the !OSGEDU resources, and more. If you have not attended any of our training events, but you are interested in  joining the !OSGEDU VO, please read below.
