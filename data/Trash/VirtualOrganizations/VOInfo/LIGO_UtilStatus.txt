The current status of !OSG sites utilization by !LIGO is summarized here: [[%ATTACHURL%/LIGO_OSG_experience.html][LIGO_OSG_experience.html]]

Here is a list of major problems encountered by !LIGO in the process of job submissions to various !OSG sites:

	* !LIGO needs to rework their applications to make them runnable on !OSG sites. !LIGO apps use interfaces historically developed for the !LIGO Data Grid and different from !OSG. Also, !LIGO apps were designed under assumption that all data are available at each site and this is not the case for !OSG sites.

	* The main technical challenge is data transfer. A !LIGO application which uses only 1-2% of available !LIGO data requires 5 !GB minimum. !CE storage is typically insufficient for !LIGO needs. !LIGO would benefit from uniform deployment of !SRM/DRM or !SRM/dcache through !OSG sites.

	* Information in !GridCat is not being maintained as !OSG production systems evolve. This forces !LIGO to monitor !OSG sites on their own.

	* It seems that !LIGO test job submissions are seriously undercounted by !Monalisa. This is currently under investigation.

At the moment, !LIGO has just a few (2 or 3) members who are interested in running the binary inspiral application on !OSG sites. In principle, the computing needs of !LIGO members are satisfied for now by the !LIGO Data Grid.

!LIGO is working to reengineer two new applications to run on the !OSG with
the goal of carrying our scientifically meaningful runs in the next couple of weeks to months.
