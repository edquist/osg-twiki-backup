---++ Status as of September 18 2006

Mariachi does not have serious computing demands for their project yet but they are planning to start running jobs on !OSG sites perhaps in mid-November.

The first big batch computing task will be running simulations using a statically-linked Linux i386 executable, a small config file for input and a single data file for output. The next step will be compiling an executable at the sites; this requires gcc with Fortran. 

Mariachi does not have a  batch processing infrastructure yet. They intend to develop it from scratch in a way that is Grid compatible.

At the same time, they are going to set up a small cluster. Once they are using it effectively, they plan to offer the cluster on the !OSG and start submitting jobs to other !OSG sites.
