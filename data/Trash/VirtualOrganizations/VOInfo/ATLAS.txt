---++ The ATLAS Experiment
Some links to learn about ATLAS:

---++ Joining the ATLAS VO

All ATLAS collaborators are entitled to join the ATLAS VO.

---++ ATLAS utilization of OSG (as of June 2006)

ATLAS utilization of [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/][US ATLAS]] OSG sites (the BNL Tier 1 and our Tier
2s) has been ~100%, dominated by ATLAS-managed [[http://panda.atlascomp.org?dash=prod][production]] via the
[[https://uimon.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/PanDA][Panda]] distributed production/analysis system. (Panda also handles a
much smaller but growing amount of [[https://uimon.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/DAonPanda][individual analysis work]].)

ATLAS production on OSG typically involves 5 sites
at present -- Brookhaven, Boston U, U Indiana, Oklahoma U, U Chicago, UT Arlington --  with a total CPU count of about 700.

Work is
underway to bring additional OSG sites into production, both "Tier 3" sites with an
ATLAS affiliation and (on an "opportunistic" basis) sites with no ATLAS involvement.
This requires
Panda-enabling the site, the two principal issues being enabling ATLAS
[[https://uimon.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/DistributedDataManagement][data management]] at the site (requirements are lightweight since an
ATLAS Tier 2 provides most of the DM services, with the local site
acting as a satellite of the Tier 2), and enabling correct processing
of Panda pilots on WNs (eg dealing with http proxy issues; Panda pilot
jobs require outbound http access, either direct or proxied). Most of
the issues have now been addressed (pilot modifications for proxying,
movement and validation of data between WN and associated Tier 2) and
ATLAS utilization of additional sites should begin soon, starting with
sites with an ATLAS affiliation and so some local support (eg SLAC,
Teragrid)."


ATLAS submits daily
[[http://gridui02.usatlas.bnl.gov:25880/server/pandamon/query?overview=usage][usage reports]]
to OSG summarizing ATLAS (Panda) utilization of OSG resources.

In addition to official ATLAS production via Panda, individual ATLAS
users make direct use of both ATLAS and non-ATLAS OSG resources, in
some cases on a large scale.

---++ ATLAS resources on OSG

ATLAS has an open policy regarding use of ATLAS OSG resources by other VOs.
The standard resource allocation policy on US ATLAS sites is to give
precedence to (US) ATLAS work, and give everything else to any OSG
recognized VO -- the list of VOs is the one pushed out by iGOC (standard OSG
procedure).

At the [[https://www.racf.bnl.gov/][BNL Tier 1]], for example, the [[https://www.racf.bnl.gov/docs/customergroup/usatlas/usatlas_condor_policy][queue structure]] provides access to 100% of the facility by non-ATLAS VOs, subject to preemption by higher priority
ATLAS work.

---++ ATLAS requirements for OSG
The only essential requirement for ATLAS to be able to make use of an OSG
site is support for outbound http (proxy is OK). ATLAS currently relies on
uberftp for data movement to/from worker nodes at Tier 3 and non-ATLAS
sites; it is installed by ATLAS
as needed but a request has been placed to have it part of the standard OSG
software stack.

---++ OSG Year 2 (FY2008) ATLAS science milestones

   1 <b>Successful support for M3-M6 cosmic sample processing -  Jan 5, 2008.</b> Data distribution and processing support utilizing US ATLAS and opportunistic resources for the M3-M6 cosmic samples (cosmic running through Nov/Dec). Commitment to 100% availability of these samples with 48hr latency, at T1 and requesting T2s. Commitment to 100% availability of select analysis (AOD etc) samples, with processing support, at T1 and at least 2 T2s. Demonstrated capability to utilize these samples from T3s and opportunistic OSG resources.
   1 <b> Support for data distribution for T1, T2 at 95% average data availability with 48hr latency &#8211; March 1, 2008.</b> At least 95% average data availability with 48hr availability latency for full T1, T2 data samples serving US ATLAS community (AODs, DPDs, ESD samples, conditions), at T1 and all T2s
   1 <b>100% utilization of full T1 & T2 processing capacity - July 1, 2008.</b> Quantitative metric for job counts based on US ATLAS facility capacity. 100% utilization of full 2007 capacity.
   1 <b>Use of 10 non-ATLAS opportunistic sites - July 1, 2008.</b> Quantitative commitment to number of opportunistic non-US ATLAS resources (10 sites) that are production-capable.
