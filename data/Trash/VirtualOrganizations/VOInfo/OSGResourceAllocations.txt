---+ !OSG Resource Allocations

While most resources connected on !OSG are allocated directly by agreements between the VOs and the resource providers (for more details, see the article, [[Documentation.AboutResourceAllocation][About Resource Allocation]]) there are some resources which are allocated to !OSG. The use and access of these resources is managed by (although use is not necessairly limited to) the !OSG VO.

Groups and other VOs interested in making use of an !OSG resource allocation should contact the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000100][Grid Operation Center]] or a member of the Executive Team.

---++ NERSC

---+++ Overview

Several clusters are available: for a description, please see [[http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/][NERSC resources]].

The PDSF resource at NERSC is not part of the allocation but is accessible to !OSG participants on an as-available basis.

Persons desiring access to any NERSC resources via the !OSG allocation should submit a request using the [[http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/PDSF/starting/newuser_form.php][PDSF account request form]],
specify !OSG as the Project and HPSS Account and include a description of what you want to do.

---+++ History

Starting October 2006 the !OSG requested and received a "Startup" allocation at the [[http://www.nersc.gov][NERSC facility]].
This allocation is 15K hours of MPP (parallel) processor time as well as storage space in the HPSS system, for use until January 2007.

New requests for allocations are made by OSG annually.

---+++ Current allocation

The FY2009 allocation granted was 125,000 !WallClock hours, with 100,000 storage units.
