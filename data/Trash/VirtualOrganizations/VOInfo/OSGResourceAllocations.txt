---+ !OSG Resource Allocations
While most resources connected on !OSG are allocated directly by agreements between the VOs and the resource providers there are some resources which are allocated to !OSG. The use and access of these resources is managed by the !OSG VO. 

Groups and other VOs interested in making use of an !OSG resource allocation should contact the 
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000100][Grid Operation Center]] or a
member of the Executive Team.

---++ NERSC (2006, 2007)
Starting October 2006 the !OSG requested and received a "Startup" allocation at the [[http://www.nersc.gov][NERSC facility]].
This allocation is 15K hours of MPP (parallel) processor time as well as storage space in the HPSS system, for use until January 2007.
!OSG also submitted a request for a "production" allocation for 2007 (see [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=507][ !OSG Doc 507]]).

For a description of the NERSC resources see http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/.
The PDSF resource at NERSC is not part of the allocation but is accessible to !OSG participants 
on an as available basis.
Persons desiring access to any NERSC resources via the !OSG allocation should submit a
request using the [[http://www.nersc.gov/nusers/resources/PDSF/starting/newuser_form.php][PDSF account request form]],
specify !OSG as the Project and include a description of what you want to do.
