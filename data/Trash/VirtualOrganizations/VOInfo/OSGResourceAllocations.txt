---+ !OSG Resource Allocations
While most resources connected on !OSG are allocated directly by agreements between the VOs and the resource providers there are some resources which are allocated to !OSG. The use and access of these resources is managed by the !OSG VO. 

---++ NERSC (2006, 2007)
Starting October 2006 the !OSG requested and received a "Startup" allocation at the [[http://www.nersc.gov][NERSC facility]].
This allocation is 15K hours of MPP processor time as well as storage space in the HPSS system, for use until January 2007.
!OSG also submitted a request for a "production" allocation for 2007 (see [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=507][ !OSG Doc 507]]).
