---++List of Complaints

   * It's hard to figure out which site supports a VO, especially if your VO is new, i.e. not part of the
     VO package of the last OSG release.
   * There is no coherent definition of time limit for OSG sites. This ends up being a truth in advertisement issue, i.e.
      a VO can't tell from the information in the GIP what the timeout limits are for batchslot lease.
   * Jobs are simply lost in cyberspace, with no apparent messages at the client.
   * As some sites preempt based on site policy/priority it would be really good to have checkpointing to avoid
     loosing all of one's work. How can we get this across the OSG, irrespective of site batch system?
   * it's a pain to retrieve job output from many sites (fkw rephrasing of nanohub input --- not sure I got it right)
   * LIGO needs to be able to stage in 0.5-1.5TB of data to be most effective. Not having this kind of space for lease
     means that more than 50% of the time of the batch slot lease they are waiting for data to arrive.
   * Standard utilities like wget are not commonly available. It's not clear what one should expect, and what one should
     bring in by onseself.
   * It's hard to see from the outside which sites are worthwhile submitting to because there's no obvious way to see
     how many batch slots are empty, and whether my VO is allowed to use them all.
