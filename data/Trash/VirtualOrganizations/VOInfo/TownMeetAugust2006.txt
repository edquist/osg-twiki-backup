---++List of Complaints

   * It's hard to figure out which site supports a VO, especially if your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is new, i.e. not part of the
     VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo package of the last OSG release.
   * There is no coherent definition of time limit for OSG sites. This ends up being a truth in advertisement issue, i.e.
      a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo can't tell from the information in the GIP what the timeout limits are for batchslot lease.
   * Jobs are simply lost in cyberspace, with no apparent messages at the client.
   * As some sites preempt based on site policy/priority it would be really good to have checkpointing to avoid
     loosing all of one's work. How can we get this across the OSG, irrespective of site batch system?
   * it's a pain to retrieve job output from many sites (fkw rephrasing of nanohub input --- not sure I got it right)
   * LIGO needs to be able to stage in 0.5-1.5TB of data to be most effective. Not having this kind of space for lease
     means that more than 50% of the time of the batch slot lease they are waiting for data to arrive.
   * Standard utilities like wget are not commonly available. It's not clear what one should expect, and what one should
     bring in by onseself.
   * It's hard to see from the outside which sites are worthwhile submitting to because there's no obvious way to see
     how many batch slots are empty, and whether my VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is allowed to use them all.
