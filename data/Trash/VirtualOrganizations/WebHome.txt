%TOC%

---++ Overview

The OSG User Group serves a liaison between scientific communities, commonly structured as Virtual Organizations (VOs), which use the OSG grid cyber-infrastructure and the OSG Executive Board, as well as the Middleware, Operations, Applications, Security, and the Sites coordination groups. 

In this capacity, the User Group aims to understand the <i>desideratum</i>, expectations and operational aspects of running VO applications on OSG resources. As need arises, the group also provides help and information to VOs and application owners, serves as an ad-hoc platform for coordinating communication across all the VOs, and represents the users' requirements and interests to OSG.

---++ Mailing Lists and News

The <u>OSG Users list</u> (=osg-users at opensciencegrid dot org=), [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-users.html][archived here]], consists of representatives of all officially registered stakeholding VOs in the OSG, and is the primary medium for circulation of important announcements and news items. This list also serves as a general VO/user discussion forum. Representatives of newly formed VOs are strongly encouraged to [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=osg-users&A=1][subscribe to the list]]. A very small subset of announcements is occasionally also posted on the [[UserGroupNewsItems][news page]].

The <u>OSG User Group Coordination list</u> (=osg-user-group at opensciencegrid dot org=) consists of the OSG User Group Coordinators, OSG Applications Coordinators, and the OSG Executive Director. A VO interested in communicating with the coordination team can feel free to [[mailto:OSG-USER-GROUP@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG][send an email to this list]] anytime.
