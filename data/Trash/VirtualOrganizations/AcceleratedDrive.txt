---++ Goal

   * Targeted work to accelerate OSG's support for specific VOs who are producing Science results.
   * Focus is on value-addition in Science, beyond LHC, and spans across broad areas within OSG technology lifecycle.
   * Ensuring technology's readiness, availability, site adoption, deployment, user adoption, operations, troubleshooting.
   * In partnership with Middleware/VDT, OSG Sites (Validation/Integration/Production), OSG Troubleshooting, OSG Operations (GOC).

<br>
Dear all - 

We had a very productive meeting. Thanks to everyone who attended, and 
our sincere gratitude to Chander for providing direction and for 
leading us all to get together. Here is a brief summary -

Attending: Chander, Kent, Stu, Suchandra, Jeff, Terrence, Abhishek

Jeff and Terrence gave an overview of work done by OSG teams for 
WS-GRAM validation. A detailed outline is at - 
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/WSGramValidation

It was discussed how WS-GRAM in GT 4.0.7, which is part of OSG 1.0, is 
in need of further improvement. Overloading of server by large-scale 
client job removal is of main concern, since this either requires 
client-side awareness and throttling or otherwise deployment on fewer 
sites. Jamie is understood to be working on a Condor-G workaround, 
alongwith Stu, but it may only be ready after OSG 1.0 public release.

Stu mentioned how WS-GRAM in GT 4.2 will solve this problem. This may 
only be ready in time for a OSG 1.0.x subrelease, or perhaps OSG 1.2. 
Chander advised that inclusion of the same in VDT as well as its 
validation/integration and site deployment are broader areas within 
OSG technology lifecycle - we decided that Alain and Rob G's decisions 
are important here, and postponed the discussion to a later date.

Stu requested for more information from Britta and LIGO's D-Grid 
collaborators, on Einstein@Home's use of WS-GRAM. This will help 
better understand if, and how, Einstein@Home's use case may or may not 
trigger the overload problem.

Suchandra and Jeff agreed that although WS-GRAM in GT 4.0.7 may be 
enabled on many OSG 1.0 sites, we should ensure that power users as 
LIGO target only select and known sites to stress-test them heavily.

Suchandra, Jeff, Abhishek pointed out that a reasonable approach 
forward would be to have two parallel paths of WS-GRAM deployment and 
usage - (a) Select sites in production, e.g., UCSD, UNL, FermiGrid; 
(b) Validation Testbed to start evaluating forthcoming GT 4.2.

Lastly but most importantly - Terrence has offered UCSD production 
site for LIGO to stress-test with Einstein@Home jobs. In addition, 
Terrence mentioned a plan to bring up a validation CE later on, with 
rapid deployment of GT 4.2 series, for both VTB as well as LIGO to 
continue to evaluate. This may help set a good pace for LIGO's GT 4.2 
adoption, in the next 6 months timeline, prior to ITB 1.1 / OSG 1.2.

We welcome Britta to identify a good day/time with D-Grid team, and to 
take lead and decide on the agenda for the next week's meeting.

Thanks again, everyone!

regards,
Abhishek
