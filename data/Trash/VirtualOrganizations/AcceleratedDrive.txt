---+!! *Accelerated Drive to Enable Science*
%TOC%

---++ Goal

   * Targeted work to accelerate OSG's support for specific VOs who are producing Science results.
   * Focus is on value-addition in Science, beyond LHC, and spans across broad areas within OSG technology lifecycle.
   * Ensuring technology's readiness, availability, site adoption, deployment, user adoption, operations, troubleshooting.
   * In partnership with OSG Project Management, OSG Sites including Validation/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Integration/Production, OSG Troubleshooting, OSG Operations (GOC), Middleware/VDT including external technical projects. 

---++ Ongoing Efforts

---+++ LIGO

WS-GRAM readiness, validation, integration, and deployment plans - driven by LIGO requirements.

   * 2 productive phone meetings with representation from LIGO, Globus, Condor-G, OSG Validation and Integration, UCSD and !FermiGrid as sites.
   * Work to resume in late June or early July.
   * Expected to be in sequence with Globus 4.0.7 -> Globus 4.2 release plans.
   * Expecting to target ITB 1.1 and OSG 1.2.
   * [[LIGO_WSGRAM][Meeting minutes]].

Diagnosis of LIGO workflow failures at select sites, with Troubleshooting and GOC.

   * [[Troubleshooting.TroubleshootingProblems][Notes]]

---+++ CDF

Technical work with CDF to evaluate SRM v2 readiness.
