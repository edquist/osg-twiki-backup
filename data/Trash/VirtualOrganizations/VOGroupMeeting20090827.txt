 [[VOGroupMeeting20090820][Weekly Forum: August 20]] 

---++ Announcements:

Testing for !myOSG (Rob Quick): STAR, Fermilab, some others sent announcements. Wants to make sure everyone is okay with !myOSG change. LIGO has not had any problems. VO group will follow up with VOs and feed back to GOC.

 Year 3 ends September 30; All VOs should sustain levels of utilization or make requests for assistance and help by then.

---++ Security 

Discussions about changes to certificates. !FermiGrid Users meeting contained details. Abhishek will ask someone from OSG security to speak about at next meeting.

Wide spectrum of users will be affected, so caution is needed.

---+++ CDF (Dennis Box)

Change caught by surprise: CMS moving worker nodes to SL5; many CDF applications aren't yet certified, so looking for new resources in a hurry. These apps do aren't checkpointed, so if pre-empted when almost done, very annoying to users. Sites that pre-empt in 24-48 hours are fine for some apps. Dennis will send Abhishek and David Ritchie list of sites that are pre-empting and will be brought to a wider audience to see if a short-term solution is likely. 

For the very short term, will be using GP grid; medium-term, trying to get apps validated on SL5.If they can't get them validated, might be a serious issue. 

VO Group and GOC will more widely announce such changes in the future. 

Would like to formally request that pre-emption policies are put on resource page, such as OIM. Wants detailed info, such as how long a job is allowed to run before pre-emption. 

Mats suggests asking sites to do this and have a best practices using examples.  With !MatchMaker, there's nothing have a couple sites they know are doing pre-emption, so avoid using those (these are sites that pre-empt a lot, not sites with policies of 24-48 hour pre-emption). 

Other news: KCA changeover causing a lot of anxiety. Software to use the KCA server has not yet been distributed for all architecture (yes for SL4, not for SL5). !Non-Fermi sites will need to install !RPMs (kx509 and kxlist) and there's worry this will catch them by surprise. OSG will not move on this as quickly as originally thought. Will be coordinated between OSG security and Fermilab security. Plan is that change will not happen until it is tested and released.

---+++  D0 

Problems causing downtime last week:
   * Infrastructure failures 3 days off: h/w failure on central db machine at Fermilab. Couldn't submit or store files. 
   * Planned migration of db machine.
   * S/W for job submission management failed, so had to be migrated and restarted.

Now up and running. 

D0 believes they are immune to the SL5 issue.

---+++ !Fermi-VO

Not present.

---+++ GPN (Greg Monaco, Kate Adams)

Last week, OSG security sent to GOC after noting a few critical probes had been failing (GOC ticket #7391). Kate is working on bringing up one of the machines as the VOMS server within a week. Abhishek will try to get Kate together with Steve Timm or Dan Yocum. 

Once VOMS server is in place, 
getting resources online is planned. Clusters will be brought back at one location and put online together.

Priorities:

1. Get VOMS server running.
2. Will put into contact w someone who can assist with locating resources/using OIM, etc... Mats is also a resource.
3. Look into expansion plan.

Brian is still a part of GPN, but they will not be managing resources at Nebraska. Kate and a couple others will be the contacts. Greg will log into !MyOSG and update contacts.

---+++ !IceCube

Not present.
