---++ Previous Minutes 

 [[VOGroupMeeting20091003][Weekly Forum: October 1]] 

---++ Announcements:


---++ Security (Doug Olson)

!VOs please fill out survey at https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDQyOWR4bTNfNVNKeVJleHVnT3NCTkE6MA asking for requirements/comments/issues aobut identity management and credential handling. See 10/8/09 email from Doug Olson for more details.

---++ Storage (Neha Sharma)

OSG Storage goal from Tanya: get more !VOs to use opportunistic storage. Abhishek will try to join Storage meeting. (!SBGrid may need some input on data staging, use of SRM. 

Newest VDT-dCache package will not include golden release (1.9.5) due to problems that need further testing.

---++ Communications 

Nothing to report.

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ CDF (Dennis Box)

New KCA changeover would affect CDF. There is some indication the packages are nearing readiness. CDF would need to make this a high-priority item if true.  

Still validating all application software with SL5; working on a queue for users to submit to either SL4 or SL5 for testing.

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)

On track. Site up and running; using pbs (condor would require rebuilding of entire site.) Engage running 4000+ hours in last couple; moving toward hiring s/w developer. Would like to hold off on soliciting more !VOs until sure they will have resources they need. 

!CompBioGrid's computation on their data set is the more resource-consuming. Peter Doherty from !SBGrid had similar experience and would be happy to answer questions.

---+++ !Fermi-VO  (Steve Timm)

Classification of sub !VOs in gratia seems to be correct.

New KCA changeover: Fermi-VO has already tested and believes they are ready.

---+++ !nanoHUB

Not present.

---+++ !NYSGrid (Steve Gallo)

Good conversation w/ !HUBzero. Will probably use some of the same submission infrastructure as !nanoHUB.
 
---+++ !SBGRID/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Working w/ a couple local users; one running jobs and plans to run more over next few weeks. One user has I/O-intensive jobs. Had to make changes to cluster. May have to change his job parameters for compatibility with other sites. (NMR local user who is part of SB software consortium partnership.)

Abhishek conveyed request for more sites to other OSG teams.
