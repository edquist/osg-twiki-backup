Gratia stats:

      * there was an OS upgrade that week, plus many machines were moved;
   * Week of August 28: 70-85% job success; 6,000-10,000 jobs; 50,000-60,000 wallclock hours.
      * small throttle put in so smaller sites not inundated.
Storage:
   * not yet using Purdue, but close. 
   * just starting to enjoy results of using standard protocols.; may make refinements in dcache config, but use of dcache has already greatly improved results.
---+++ Plans:

Phase 1 will be closed out within 2 weeks. Phase 2 will be revisited in 2 months

Fermilab is effectively increasing effort; A plan of work is being worked on; First priority is working on the reconstruction production problems; storage will be addressed later (estimating ~1 month).
