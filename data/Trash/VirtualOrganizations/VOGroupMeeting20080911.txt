---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[UserGroupMeeting20080904][Previous week's minutes]]

---++ SBGrid (Ian S-R and Ian L)
No representation this week. A joint 
SBGrid and OSG-wide taskforce is being formed, to collate and begin 
convergence on all site infrastructure and science application tasks. 
Abhishek working on this offline.

---++ D0 with OSG Storage (Tanya Levshina)

Abhishek spoke w/ Tanya: things were good last week except for 2 days when there were problems w/ Purdue's SRM site. The SAM station addressing SRM hung; a bug was discovered and fixed; no problems since.

---++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark) with OSG Accounting (Philippe Canal)

   * [[NanohubNotes][Aug 21 discussion]] 
   * Goals: 
      * Understand possibility of different conventions, and thus variations in job accounting; nanoHUB vis-a-vis Gratia. 
      * Try to diagnose causes of low job success rates. 
      * Suggest, and move forward, measures to improve job success rates, i.e., nanoHUB efficiency. Encourage nanoHUB to increase utilization of OSG Facility. 
      * Solicit nanoHUB's citing OSG usage in publications and in scientific result 
   * %BLACK%Accounting Discrepencies:%ENDCOLOR% 
      * %BLACK%Are "grid jobs" and batch jobs both being reported by nanoHUB? <br />%ENDCOLOR% 
         * %BLACK%Preston to send Philippe list of condor jobs and/or look at condor_history by next week.<br />%ENDCOLOR% 
      * %BLACK%New possible problem: Jobs not appearing on days Preston thinks they're running; Philippe would like to track a job from start to finish.%ENDCOLOR% 
   * %BLACK%Step Two: look at job success rates: after accounting issues resolved%ENDCOLOR% 
   * %BLACK% *Status:* Philippe & Preston decided to look at jobs from 1st week of September. There's still a big discrepancy between what's being counted as jobs by gratia and nanaHUB. Preston needs to manually check the history to see what agrees. He needs a query from Philippe with same DN name; also needs local help; needs one more week. %ENDCOLOR% 

---++ CDF (Dennis Box)
Dennis expressed interest in attending meetings 
weekly. He works with CDF Offline group and CAF Operations.

---++ VO Security and Policy (Doug Olson)

Doug/Mine not present. Need more info from them regarding their expectations. Security team is looking for closer interaction w/ VOs. Is this meeting the appropriate forum? Should they come to the weekly meetings (most thought no, that was too often) or bi-monthly meetings? Dennis & Joel will ask some of their colleagues.

---++ MPI coordination for OSG Engagement (Mats Rynge)
 Nothing New: Since this is one of VO Group's Y3 goals, need to gauge progress every 2 weeks.

---++ Inactive VOs
   * Geant4 
   * GRASE 
 These two VOs have very low levels of activity. They were contacted via email to see if they intended to be more active or if they planned to cease operations fully. Heard nothing from Geant4. GRASE responded, but not clearly. They say there is overlap b/t their VO and NYSGrid; they expressed interest in keeping their VO status, but don't seem to be planning to be active. Ruth & Miron were consulted; Ruth wants to defer discussion until later; Miron wants to know more.

---++ OSG VO usage

   * OSG VO user is regularly causing load spikes on SBGrid and other sites head nodes. Looks like internal project specific to osg-edu or osg vo, where there are many very short jobs being run. May not be using Grid Monitor (probably using SWIFT). Suggestions: (1) Limit number of concurrent events allowed to run (2) group jobs into larger jobs. 
   * Larger discussion of whether use of Documentation/Release3.GridMonitor will be made a requirement. Abhishek will follow up w/ Frank to see what's up w/ this. 

---++ VO Online Message Board
