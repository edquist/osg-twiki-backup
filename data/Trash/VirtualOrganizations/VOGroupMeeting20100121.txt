---+++ !GlueEX (Richard Jones)

Status of clusters to ReSS: not done yet; wants to make sure that CE is stable first. Needed to create a new CE standalone machine, which hit dcache hard. Has contact from this forum who offered to help get ReSS going once CE issue resolved.

Will open GOC tickets or send email if expediting needed.

Not present.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Looking at results from production runs from last week; 2 GOC tickets open on site-specific dependencies. (#7748 and 7963)

Highest number of job slots achieved is 1200 concurrent jobs (goal is 3000). Looking at gratia, SBGriD consumed an average of 12K wall hours/day at 64% efficiency. 60,000 jobs at efficiency of 82%. In SBGrid view, job success rate is 75%. Focus will be on improving this.

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)
Still working GOC ticket #7870 for intermittent GRAM 12 errors. Is going to reinstall O/S and then reinstall CE to see if that helps. Will report back.

---+++ GPN (Kate Adams)

Has a contact for getting DOE certs approved for users.
