---++ %ORANGE% *OSG Connect Service* %ENDCOLOR%

The OSG Connect services enables Campus Researcher to send DHTC work to the OSG production fabric using "bulk" connections (examples are flocking and BOSCO).  This service is hosted at the OSG GOC at Indiana University.  Basically it is a virtual Condor pool that uses the gWMS system to send jobs to the production OSG Fabric.

In addition, we provide consulting assistance to campus researchers on how to connect to this service; integration support is available for campus who wants to leverage the OSG Connect service.
