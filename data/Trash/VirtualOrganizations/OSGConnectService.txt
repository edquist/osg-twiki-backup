---++ Overview
 
The OSG Connect services enables _Campus Researchers_ to send DHTC work to the OSG production fabric using "bulk" connections (examples are flocking and BOSCO).  The job submit services may be hosted at a number of locations, but one certainly will be hosted at the OSG GOC at Indiana University.  An OSG Connect job submission service itself is a Condor pool that uses the gWMS system to send jobs to the production OSG Fabric.

There are additional components to the OSG Connect service, including:

   * A secure sign-up and user engagement service (this will be osgconnect.net)
   * Consulting assistance to campus researchers regarding how to connect to this service
   * Integration support for campuses using the services
   * Consulting services for managing DHTC workflows on the OSG fabric

---++ Requirements

---+++ Registration and User Engagement Services (not shown)

   * A web sever providing secure access to the OSG Connect Engagement Portal.  Should provide SSL access from a publicly recognized CA.
   * A registration service ideally based on the researcher's _campus identity of origin_, as provided through [[http://shibboleth.net/][Shibboleth]] and InCommon services.
   * Engagement Portal server which collects and associated relevant researcher metadata, including usual identity information but also, where appropriate, VO, Campus Grid, project information, PI information.
   * This may include project names appropriate for accounting purposes, as well as an aggregation portal for usage statistics and research results. 

---+++ Campus Submit Nodes (labeled as #1 in diagram above)

The requirement here would be relatively lightweight but could include, for example, depending on the access mode used:

   * A Linux computer or laptop providing direct ssh access to an OSG Connect host.
   * Same, but using BOSCO to access the OSG Connect host
   * A web-based portal to access the OSG Connect host


---+++ OSG Connect Nodes (labeled as #2 diagram above)
 
We envision a network of "VO front-end" submit hosts which submit to a set of production glideinWMS factories.
