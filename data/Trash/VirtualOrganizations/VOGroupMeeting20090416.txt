---+ Agenda

---++ VOs in focus

---+++ !CompBioGrid (Jeff Dutton)
Starting official validation of CE and found a problem. Reinstalled O/S to a version known to work, reinstalled OSG client and reconfigured. Problem fixed. 

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)
Caltech is suspending jobs to the extent that D0 cannot use this site. Trash/Engagement also sees this at Caltech and sometimes GLOW. Possibly contact Caltech and ask to review suspension/preemption policy. This will be discussed at next week's OSG Production meeting and Burt Holzman (CMS) will be able to take issue to CMS folks. 

Fermilab/Teragrid gateway: Joel has not heard anything from Fermilab.

---+++ GPN
Not present.

---+++ GUGrid
Not present.

---+++ GROW
Couldn't stay; no report.

---+++ !IceCube (Steve Barnet & Ian Rae)
Ian is working on modifying simulation code and eliminating dependencies. They have some applications that have a maximum requirement of 14GB total storage for jobs that take 1-2GB to run. Mats suggested the osg-data or osg-wn-temp environment variables for temporary storage. Britta will start email thread between Mats, Suchandra and !IceCube to look at needs. 

---+++ Fermi-VO
Not present.

---++ AOB

---+++ Engage-VO
Trash/Engagement working on workshop in North Carolina next week; have been working with local campuses and finding lots of new users.

---+++ Planning toward VORS-deprecation
VORS will be deprecated within a few months, replaced by !MyOSG, OIM, & RSV. VOs with known dependencies are: LIGO, Fermi, DES, !NYSGrid, !SBGrid, STAR, and probably more. All affected VOs are requested to email their requirements to us. These will be forwarded to the Software Tools Group to help prepare for the transition.
