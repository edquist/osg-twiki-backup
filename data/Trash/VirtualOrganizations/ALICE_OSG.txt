---+!! *Joint ALICE-OSG Effort* <br>to enable ALICE on Open Science Grid<br>

---++ Key Expertise

*Iwona Sakrejda* and *Shreyas Cholia* - NERSC. Technical expertise on (ALICE)-OSG operations.<br>
*Pablo Saiz* - EU ALICE. Technical expertise on ALICE-(OSG) operations.<br>
*Federico Carminati* and *Latchezar Betev* - EU ALICE.<br>
*Ron Soltz* - US ALICE. And, LLNL.<br>
*Alain Roy* - OSG Software.<br>
*Burt Holzman* - OSG Interoperability.<br>
*Ruth Pordes* and *Miron Livny* - OSG. <br>

---++ Strategy & Goals

   * Understand more clearly the actual operational interaction of VO-Box/AliEn model with OSG model.
   * Understand the high-end hardware requirements for a VO-Box to get a view of usage limits and of scalability, considering average to full-scale heavy-duty 'job volume' by ALICE users.
   * Deploy VO-Box stack on top of OSG 1.0 stack, at NERSC, running ALICE jobs, then evaluate software stack commonalities and any issues from real operational experience.
   * Discuss expansion plan to more OSG sites, and corroborate on resolving any known severe technological barriers.
   * Expand to LLNL as the second ALICE OSG site.
   * Look at more sites if all has gone well.
