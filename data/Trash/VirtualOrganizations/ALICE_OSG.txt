---++ Strategy and Goals

   * Understand more clearly the actual operational interaction of VO-Box/AliEn model with OSG model.
   * %RED%Understand the high-end hardware requirements for a VO-Box to get a view of usage limits and of scalability, considering average to full-scale heavy-duty 'job volume' by ALICE users.%ENDCOLOR%
   * Deploy VO-Box stack on top of OSG 1.0 stack, at NERSC, running ALICE jobs, then evaluate software stack commonalities and any issues from real operational experience.
   * Discuss expansion plan to more OSG sites, and corroborate on resolving any known severe technological barriers.
   * Expand to LLNL as the second ALICE OSG site.
   * Look at more sites if all has gone well.

---++ Phase-1 Operational Summary (Pablo, Iwona)

To sum up the exercises, we managed to run ALICE jobs using the OSG software. We did it in two ways: first submitting from NERSC to the worker nodes using =condor_submit= and requesting to go to *pdsfgrid.nersc.gov/jobmanager-sge*. 

When that worked, we tried also sending to other sites, such as *osp1.lbl.gov/jobmanager-pbs* and *osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu/jobmanager-condor*. After landing on the worker nodes, a script installed !AliEn (if it had not been installed before) and start a !JobAgent that requested ALICE jobs. This second scenario also worked.

This is the updated list of issues (in order of importance):

Case 1: If we want to run only at NERSC:

   * %RED%If we want to run this on production mode, we will need either some kind of proxy renewal or a service certificate without passphrase that can be used to create proxies on the fly.%ENDCOLOR%

   * There were some problems because the jobagents landed in worker nodes with the wrong platform. We fixed it by creating a =$HOME/.sge_request= file, specifying the SGE queue and requirements. %RED%There was some discussion about passing the arguments from condor to SGE.  It is not clear if there was any conclusion, though. %ENDCOLOR%

   * X509_CER_DIR. The VO-Box needs to authenticate both to the ALICE servers and to the OSG servers. Therefore, this environment variable has to point to a directory that contains all of the CAs. At the moment, =/chos/common/lx_local/pkg/OSG-1.0.0/globus/TRUSTED_CA= doesn't contain the !AliEn CA, so we setup such that variable to point to the CAs distributed with !AliEn (ALICE distributeS some of the CA of OSG, but not all). %RED%For the time being it works, but if OSG can decide to include a new CA%ENDCOLOR% - for e.g., in =/chos/common/lx_local/pkg/OSG-1.0.0/globus/TRUSTED_CA=, ALICE will have to put it also in the CA distributed by !AliEn.

Case 2: If we want to run also on other sites:

   * The high ports on pdsfvo.nersc.gov are not visible from other sites. ALICE would need to have them open. %RED%We need to open at least ports 1094,8082,8084,8085 and 9991%ENDCOLOR%.

   * When Pablo submits to *osg-edu.cs.wisc.edu*, mapping is received to a generic user (osgedu.users). [Ques. <i>I see that there is a lot of stuff installed by other people mapped to the same generic user. I haven't tried, but it looks like I have the right to delete their things. Does it mean that any of these users could also delete whatever I install?</I>]

All the other issues have been solved. 

---++ !JobAgents, Site Proxy, Central Task Queue

ALICE uses generic pilots (!JobAgents), which fetch the payload 
from the ALICE central task queue. The Site Proxy (SP) service running 
on the VO-box, forwards the job agent request to the central task 
queue.

The job agent communicates with the SP, and the SP is the one that communicates with the central task queue.
