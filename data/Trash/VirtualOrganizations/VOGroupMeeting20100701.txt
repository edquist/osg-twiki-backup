---++ Previous Minutes 

[[VOGroupMeeting20100624][Weekly Forum: June 24]] 

---++ Announcements 

Abhishek/David Ritchie:  There were about ~365 scientific publications from 15 !VOs. Submission to NSF has been made. Annual report linked off [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][www.opensciencegrid.org]].

Ongoing updates of stakeholders' plans over next year: Would like to wrap up by July 10. Needs, requirements and plans will be filtered throughout the OSG. 

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Not present..

---++ Storage 

Dan Fraser: Still evaluating technologies for opportunistic storage. Probably will not make decision until fall.

---++ %BLACK% VOs In Focus %ENDCOLOR%

---++ CDF 

Not present.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Production. Still having difficulty at OU. 

Working with Richard on UConn problem. Joel upgraded the OSG version, but this didn't fix it. 

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

Steve is documenting the process for clusters running both SL4 and SL5. (Those running on FNAL !FermiGrid1 will need this information.) 

!SBGrid jobs are failing--causing problems for !FermiGrid and others. Steve will open a GOC ticket and cc Igor, Peter and Ian. 

Working on VO requirements.

---++ !GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

Production side: Production going okay. Working with Joel to see why jobs don't complete. Richard is reviewing a D0 log from a successful job run at another site. Joel has sent email with an idea for a test.

Engagement users are trying to get started using opportunistic storage. Richard ha a space reservation in !dCache issue. When a user wants x bytes and uses that space, it works. If using gridftp and writing directly to a URL, there is a fully qualified entry name issue. We will put in touch with designers of SRM implementation in !dCache. 

VO side: had meeting with Jefferson Lab Computing Division leaders. There are some misgivings, but they said they eventually plan to provision an SRM, at least give access to large tape libraries and allow planned access to offsite resources. They have opened the firewall so on-site users can use VO, however, they have not opened incoming ports to get clients back. A one-page description of ports was requested. Dan suggested putting OSG Security members in touch with Jefferson Lab security teams. 

---++ !GridUNESP (Gabriel Winckler)

Things starting to ramp up. Over the past month, usage has gone from an average 30% to 80%. They plan to try to run MPI. There is a variation in jobs--some being more massively parallel and others less so. Dan said there is method to tell condor to access all of the memory and processors on a machine. Dan will send the link to Gabriel.

Abhishek has received stakeholder plans from Sergio Novaes.

---++ !IceCube (Steve Barnet)

Not present.

---++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid

Not present.

---++! DOSAR

Nothing to report.

---++! GPN

Meteorologist is working with Engagement team. 

---++ AOB

Marco:  OSG Site Administrators Workshop August 10 and 11 at Computing Center at University of Chicago. All site administrators are invited. Marco will send email announcement to David Ritchie, who will forward to !iSGTW for announcement and Marcia will post on OSG home page.

Robert Engel: any questions regarding documentation? 
Ramping up documentation for VO end user VOMS and VOMRS. 

!Glue-X will do VOMRS
Still looking for someone to document GUMS.
