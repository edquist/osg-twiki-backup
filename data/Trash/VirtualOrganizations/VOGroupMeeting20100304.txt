---++ Communications 

---++ VOs in focus 

---+++ CDF 

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Production going well - 1.5 M for last 4 days; waiting for a repair on a forwarding node. Caltech SE now in system (haven't determined whether working yet). 

How will the SE be maintained? oldest files deleted as maximum space used. SE at UTA also initiated.

---+++  !GlueX (Richard Jones)

Have seen first OSG jobs; with help from Joel Snow and Brian Bockelman. Implemented NAT; every VO now has own ID. General impression of process of getting set up: positive; it's taken ~2 hours a week worth of work and seemed easy. Some items/policies (such as requiring internet access on all worker nodes) are not obvious, so that would save a lot of work. Will talk about this in presentation next week.

Next step: how to find resources: !MatchMaker, condor probes, or ???


---+++ !IceCube 

---+++ nanoHUB

---+++ !OSG-VO (CHARMM) (Maxim Potekhin)

In past week, Tim Miller using 8 sites (running under OSG-VO). Current usage is 1000 CPUhrs/day, using PANDA. Will give talk and demo  at All-Hands.

---+++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid (Peter Doherty)

Still working on job failure rate. 

Q: Condor DAGMan and OSG MM. Submitting 10,000 jobs. 1st cycle: 80%. Retry: over 90%.  Is this a normal completion rate on a large workflow?

A: Look at cause of failures. Not getting standard globus errors. Should probably bring Mats or Brian online for troubleshooting. Also working w/ Maxim on PANDA: Maxim will work on setting up and testing.
