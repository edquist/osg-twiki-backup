---+++ Issues from previous meetings

---++++ Action

---+++ MPI

---++++ Discussion

Discussion centered on the logistics of setting up MPI.

   * Mats: currently, there are very few OSG sites that are really set up to run MPI via OSG mechanism. We should make sure we can efficiantly use these before we can appeal to other site admins to invest effort in the MPI configuration of these other sites. Propose to concentrate on Purdue and NERSC for now. Doug Olson will be contacted for the latter.

   * Maxim: doesn't matter much in what format the site boilerplate info is stored. Automatic aggregation will not be implemented in near future (Gabriele) due to code changes needed in EMon/GIP etc, so a starting point would be asking site admins to provide such basic info to us.

   * Mats: thinking of ways to provide an option of remote compilation. Aggregate boilerplate info will be useful in that regard.

---++++ Action

   * Maxim: will follow up on the CHARMM @ Purdue; code changes needed in a Panda component to access the mpi funcitonality. Also, follow up on "Nemo 3D" which is currently run interactively (another MPI app, from Nanohub).
