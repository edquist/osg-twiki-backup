[[VOGroupMeeting20100617][Weekly Forum: June 17]] 

---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

We are inviting annual stakeholder updates to - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/Trash/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements. Plans and needs of VOs will be summarized and prioritized as input to FY 2010-11 planning.

OSG software stack will move from Java 1.5 to 1.6., and Alain Roy has asked for input from stakeholders. Thanks to the all the VOs who have responded. Seems that this change will not affect anyone in a major way.

Collection for list of scientific publications has come to a closure in this cycle. Abhishek will send out summary in email. 

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Nothing to report.

---++ Storage (Abhishek - for Tanya)

We are inviting stakeholder participation in the OSG Storage Forum; at University of Chicago on September 21-22. Meeting webpage is http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceProgram.py?confId=3377. 

OSG Storage is evaluating technologies for provisioning opportunistic storage. !iRODS is within focus. Interested VOs should send a note to Tanya.

---++ CDF (Stephan Lammel - offline)

CDF need additional packages on SL5 sites. Burt/CMS has advised to use CMSSW installation model. CDF already has a similar model but still need to hardcode which libraries to probe for. Tedious due to the large list. OSG Security has pointed out Pakiti's package query feature. Abhishek will follow up with Stephan/CDF.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Production going well as usual.

GOC tickets submitted regarding jobs at UNL cluster not getting files from SE.  Richard Jones's fix to the NSF-lite wrapper fixed the original problem, but last application crashes when first event tries to write a file.

Richard Jones asked Joel snow to notify him when Joel is sending a job. 

UTA SE being used by D0 now.

Abhishek asked whether persistent low efficiency at Purdue RCAC and Florida sites needs attention from VO Group. Joel said jobs seemingly are pre-empted or evicted. Dan had talked to Preston at Purdue and Preston thinks it's simply a matter of setting expectations. Dan feels Joel is doing well getting slots, considering the site policies. Dan and Abhishek believe that the OSG will take a general look at how different sites are contributing opportunistic usage over time.

---++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Nothing to report.

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

No major changes from last week. Steve just returned from CERN. LCG experiments talking about virtual worker nodes. Steve anticipates this may  affect the US based operations of ATLAS and CMS. Steve to email URL to the osg-vo-forum list. 

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)

After investigating the dropped connections issue, found out that firewall had embedded parameter in local rather than global setting. Univ of Connecticut network team will try to extend timeout for Subnet, and modify Session TTL (time to live). Richard asked for more input on a good setting for TTL. Steve Timm noted that Glide-Ins need about 72 hours. Condor can be configured to lengthen outbound, but not inbound connections. Richard agreed to try 72 hours as the new setting.

Regarding opportunistic storage: Richard investigated SRM functionality of SE. !DCache gives maximum reservation size, but doesn't seem to parcel it out properly if several communities target the same space. Richard should send email to osg-storage list. Abhishek remembers an ongoing debate in the past regarding this issue; and will facilitate GLUE-X team to get design-level input from SRM team if needed.

Dan mentioned that providing Opportunistic Storage is an ongoing issue. !iRODS is being evaluated. In future, this may be set up centrally so VOs can go there and reserve storage and so everyone can see who is reserving. It may completely remove management of storage space from endpoint. Joel said that D0 already has this type of system in usage (possibly at LONI) and it looks appealing.

Activity to get other OSG users: Computing model at Jefferson Lab isn't very familiar with grid computing on OSG. Richard met with Jefferson Lab senior team about letting users use OSG client stack, but there was concern about support and port ranges. Richard has permission to install the client on GLUE-X/JLab central server. Requested access through firewall throughout site, but need is to have incoming ports open also for returning calls; not sure whether !JLab will agree. Steve Timm advised on using Condor-G; one can minimize the number of open ports (i.e., use 3 per site per outbound user). Port range also depends on estimated number of connections to be opened, i.e., number of users and estimated load.

Someone saw Dan's talk and spoke with Richard regarding Campus Grids. He's interested in getting a new VO on campus. Dan asked whether he needs to be a new VO or can he use GLUE-X? It is a different scientific application (Bioinformatics); so scope is different from GLUE-X (particle physics). 

Abhishek said that VOs can have different scopes: one science doamin, or several different domains. Abhishek will follow up with Richard Jones offline. The Bioinformatics researcher is currently putting in a grant proposal.

---++ !SBGrid/NEBioGrid

Not present. Abhishek is in loop on progress with !GlideinWMS work.

Site Administrators Workshop (Marco Mambelli): August 10-11 joint workshop with US-CMS Tier 3 workshop at Vanderbilt. It will be tutorial-based. Open to all sites, mainly targeted to smaller sites. 

Document Alignment (Robert Engel): Documents related to VOs are now being managed with new twiki variables; reviewers expected to begin soon. Abhishek and Robert are in discussions offline to make a collaborative plan.
