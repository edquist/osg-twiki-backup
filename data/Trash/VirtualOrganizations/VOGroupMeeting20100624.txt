[[VOGroupMeeting20100617][Weekly Forum: June 17]] 

---++ Announcements (Abhishek Singh Rana)

We are inviting annual stakeholder updates to - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/VirtualOrganizations/Stakeholder_PlansNeedsRequirements. Plans and needs of VOs will be summarized and prioritized as input to FY 2010-11 planning.

OSG software stack will move from Java 1.5 to 1.6., and Alain Roy has asked for input from stakeholders. Thanks to the 12 !VOs who have responded so far.  Seems that this change will not affect anyone in a major way.

Collection for list of scientific publications has come to a close. Abhishek will send out summary email. Almost 400 publications from about 15 stakeholders.

---++ Security (Doug Olson)

Nothing to report.

---++ Storage (Abhishek - for Tanya)

We are inviting stakeholder participation in the OSG Storage Forum; at University of Chicago on September 21-22. Meeting webpage is http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceProgram.py?confId=3377. 

Among new storage technologies for provisioning opportunistic storage is !iRods. Interested VOs should send note.

---++ D0 (Joel Snow)

Produciton as usual

GOC tickets submitted regarding jobs at UNL cluster not getting files from SE.  Richard Jones's fix to the NSF-lite wrapper fixed original problem, but last application crashes when first event tries to write a file.

Richard Jones asked Joel to notify him when Joel is sending a job. 

UTA SE being used.

Abhishek asked whether persistent low efficiency at Purdue, ArchTech and Florida needs attention from VO group. Joel said jobs seemingly are pre-empted or evicted.  Dan Fraser had talked to Preston at Purdue and Preston thinks it's a problem of expectations; Dan feels Joel is doing well getting slots, considering the site policies. Dan believes that the OSG will take a general look at how different sites are contributing opportunistic usage over time.

---++ DOSAR (Horst Severini)

Nothing to report.

---++ Fermilab-VO (Steve Timm)

No major changes from last week. Steve just returned from CERN. LCG experiments talking about virtual worker nodes. Steve anticipates this will affect the U.S. a bit. Steve will email link to talks to forum. 

---++ GLUE-X (Richard Jones)
After investigating dropping connections, found out that firewall has embedded parameter in local rather than global setting. They will try to extend timeout for subnet. Session TTL . Steve Timm notes that !GlideIns need about 72 hours. Condor can be configured to lengthen outbound, but not inbound connections.

Regarding opportunistic storage: Richard investigated SRM functionality of SE. !Dcache gives maximum reservation size, but doesn't seem to parcel it out properly if several communities target the same space. Richard should send email to osg-storage list. Abhishek remembers an ongoing debate in the past regarding this issue in the past.

Dan mentions that providing Opportunistic Storage is an ongoing issue within the SOG. One scenario investigating is !iRods (metadata manager type thing). Looking at setting up centrally so VOs can go there and reserve storage and so you can see who is reserving. Completely removes management of storage space from endpoint. Joel said that D0 already has this type of system and it is very nice.

Activity to get other OSG users: Computing Division people at !JLab aren't used to OSG. Met with leaders in computing center about letting users use OSG client, but they are concerned about support. Richard has permission to install the client on their central server. Requested access through firewall throughout site, but you have to have incoming ports open also for returning calls; not sure whether they will agree. Steve Timm: Using condor-g, you can minimize the number you need (use 3 per site per outbound user).

Someone saw Dan F's talk and spoke with Richard regarding Campus Grids. He's interested in getting a new VO going on campus. Dan asked whether he needs to be a new VO or can he use GLUE-X? But it is a different scientific application (bioinformatics) than the GLUE-X physics project. 

Abhishek said that in the past, a new VO would not be formed for one science community, but rather for several different communities. Abhishek will follow up with Richard Jones offline. Researcher is currently putting in a grant proposal.

Not present.

Site Administrators Workshop (Marco Mambelli): August 10-11 joint workshop with US-CMS Tier 3 workshop at Vanderbilt. Will be tutorial-based. Open to all sites, mainly targeted to smaller sites.

Document Alignment meeting (Robert Engel): Documentation in VO area since last week: Trying to get committment from a couple !VOs to review a document. Abhishek wonders whether reviewing a document requires a hands-on test of the process or is prior knowledge of how to perform a task sufficient. Robert does not recommend "!TBDs" be used in document table, however, Abhishek is still negotiating and does not feel comfortable using names of individuals without their permission.
