---++ Upcoming Events 

December 2: SVOPME presentation.

SVOPME is a tool for VOs and sites that makes it easy to handle complex internal organizational structures and their privilege mappings at sites. The tool was developed in collaboration with TechX as part of an SBIR. What are VO plans to move to more complex structures of groups and roles? 




---++  VOs In Focus 


---+++ CDF (Rick St. Denis)
Copying more files to KISTI. Still need to do stress testing.

Gabriele helped Rick get gridftp running to improve performance when copying files back. This was efficient, but then used IPERF, suggested by KISTI, which was much slower. Still working on issue.

There still are some pbs crashes that remain a concern. This will be an issue discussed at the CDF meeting Chander is organizing.

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow)

[[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9566][Ticket]] for Cornell still outstanding.

GEANT-4 (Marko Slyz)

Setting up to do runs on GEANT4; Hoping for release in mid-December.
Were using opportunistic cyles during testing and seemed satisfied.

LSSD (Gabriele Garzoglio)
Recently finished run on OSG (Phase 2). Image simulation group John Peterson asked to do validation on images between what they do and what we do on the OSG. Essentially 6 images, each made of 3000+ chip images. Evaluation of OSG to do validation was successful.

Gabriele will meet on Monday to discuss next phrase.

---+++ !DayaBay

Not present.

---+++ Fermi-VO (Steve Timm)

Recovering from Power Outage

---+++ !GLOW 

Not present.

---+++ !SBGrid (Peter Doherty)

!SBGrid is a software distribution platform; consortium of virtual biology labs throughout the U.S. and other countries. 
Our portal is in beta testing for !SBGrid members for main workflow. just announced; Run about twelve so far. Use about 20-40K hours each (varies). 160K hours one day last week. Good success rates at this point and infrastructure at this level is stable.

A couple small ongoing issues remain unresolved. 

Regarding Ian's reported problem where pilot jobs were landing on sites but not pulling in work: Peter said the problem doesn't seem to happen often, but when it does, it's significant. VO/Users group still waiting on data from Ian.

Pilot jobs running ok; user job starts, then instantly fails. front end recogs failure and resubmits jobs, etc. No solution in Condor. Condor/glidein doesn't recognize failure and stop submitting job. Igor said they can set up wrapper around jobs

Site to see how many jobs fail (tentative):
