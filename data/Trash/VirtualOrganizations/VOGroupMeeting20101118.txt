December 2: SVOPME presentation.

SVOPME is a tool for VOs and sites that makes it easy to handle complex internal organizational structures and their privilege mappings at sites. The tool was developed in collaboration with TechX as part of an SBIR. What are VO plans to move to more complex structures of groups and roles?
