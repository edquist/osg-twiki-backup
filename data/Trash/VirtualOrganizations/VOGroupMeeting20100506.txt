Please contact Brad Abbott (University of Oklahoma) for science publications. 

UTA progress: Abhishek submitted note to Mark; Joel will try again to see if he can access.

Continuing work on gathering science publications.


---+++ GLUE-EX (Richard Jones) 

Queues full; 384 cores; half capacity occupied w/ local users, half OSG; a number of University grid power failures but no loss of hardware.

One GOC ticket that SE down. Happy to let others use opportunistic storage. Joel (D0) will send test jobs. 

GIP server update. (validation tests not running on site; bug on GIP server which will be updated in next release).

Trying to collate list of job submission issues (What set of tests need to be done up front to help VOs figure out where to submit jobs); would appreciate Richard's input.
