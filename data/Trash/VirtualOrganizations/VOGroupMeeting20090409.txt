Received written report from Jeff:

"It has been a slow week for progress on the site as I have been busy working on supporting a number of lab machines that I have put off in the past few weeks when  progress on our OSG site was moving quickly.  I was working on the local installation of Gratia and found that either the documentation is incorrect or something is wrong from a software point of vew with the package.  Once installed, I can't make connections to the database via a socket and the web interface has errors trying to load the page because of database connectivity issues.  I did find that the CE Firewall guide may not have all the necessary ports open for a local Gratia installation as there are more ports in the config file than on the CE Firewall page.  Before I forget, I do realize it it an optional service.  Even with the expanded list of ports open, uninstalling/reinstalling does not fix the issues.  I can log in to the local MySQL database but not through the socket connection as described in the documentation.  I have since given up and uninstalled the local Gratia since it just doesn't seem to be worth the trouble at the moment.  
 
I have also revisited the worker-node installation.  Since we rolled our cluster back a version to overcome the Condor issue with timestamps, I needed to reinstall the worker-node and get some of the finer details done such as making sure the certificates are visible to the worker-nodes and that it is updating correctly.  Those sorts of things.
 
I will be moving on to validating the compute element (as it states in the Release Documentation) next week.  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationValidatingComputeElement
 
As for Ion trying the site, I checked and I see no activity from him this week.  It does not surprise me as he has been away to three different meetings in the last two weeks.  I will update on his activites when they happen and any thoughts he may have on time frames for getting our jobs running and any collaborations that may involve up-and-coming grid users via CompBioGrid."


---+++D0 (Joel Snow)
Had a peak in consumption 2 weeks ago. Gratia indicates the use of 140,000-160,000 wallclock hours per hday and 8.5 million events on OSG for that week. Production is keeping up adequately, but have a problem delivering files to a site (Fermilab issue).

An open GOC ticket related to VOMS monitor has been resolved.

---+++Security (Doug Olson)
Robot Certificates issue: OSG does not have a policy on the use of service certs, but it does have recommendations. Mine is thinking about how to adjust our recommendations.

---++ AOB
GOC proposal for VORS deprecation: An email has been sent; timeline is early August. The new tools are a combination of OIM, !MyOSG and others; no features will be lost. Abhishek has requested that GOC send a list of new features.
