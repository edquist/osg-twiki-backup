---++ Announcements 

   * Scientific Publications (David Ritchie):* (See attachment to minutes). We are in the process of collecting publications that relate to the benefits to OSG to be sent to NSF/DOE. We will ask for a complete list of publications from VO management in the next three or four weeks. Publications are to be categorized in 3 areas (scientific publications, OSG and related projects, OSG papers for general reference; see examples at [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/What_We%27re_Doing/Scientific_Publications][http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/What_We%27re_Doing/Scientific_Publications]].
You're welcome to send in your list now to osg-contact at opensciencegrid dot org

   * Reminder: Security team looking into ways to integrate registration process for GridCerts and VOs. Any VOs who would like to talk to Security team welcome to email Doug @ dlolson at lbl dot gov or osg-security at opensciencegrid dot org. In the near time, Doug is puttting together a web form for certificate registration that will be specific to the OSG and include a list of sponsors. 

   * Looking for VO input on job submission errors. These will be collected and collated in an effort to simplify the process for new !VOs.
