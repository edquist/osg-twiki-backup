---+ Introduction

%STARTSECTION{"IntroductionGeneric"}%
%LINK_BESTMAN%, developed by the [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/][Scientific Data Management Group]] at [[http://www.lbl.gov][Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], is a generic [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/doc/SRM.v2.2.html][SRM v2.2]] load balancing front-end for transfer servers and disk-based storage systems. It works on top of existing disk-based POSIX-compliant file systems, and is known to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS2, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre. It also works with various file transfer services, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp.
%ENDSECTION{"IntroductionGeneric"}%

#FullMode
%BESTMAN% in %BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode is fully compliant with SRM v2.2. It provides support for the dynamic management of the available storage space and queuing of SRM requests. It can be configured to support MSS. If you are not planning to use dynamic space management, request queuing and not interested in Mass Storage Service (MSS) support you should consider to install [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan-gateway]] instead.

%STARTSECTION{"MoreInfo"}%
For general information on storage software architecture, implementations and use, please read [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/StorageInfrastructureSoftware][on storage infrastructure software]]. For information on planning, installing and validating storage software see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/StorageSiteAdministrator][here]].
%ENDSECTION{"MoreInfo"}%

---+ Engineering Considerations

%STARTSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart1"}%

%BESTMAN% could be installed on one node and the installation cache consists of the following components: 
   * %BESTMAN% is an implementation of SRM v2.2 for essential interfaces to disk based storage systems - [[https://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman][BeStMan Home Page]] 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.2/4.2.1/data/gridftp/][GridFTP documentation]]. 
   * optional package
      *  [[GratiaTransferProbe][Gratia gridftp transfer probe]] - cron job that reports all the file transfers to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector Gratia collector]]
   * If you want %BESTMAN% to use GUMS for authorization, you should be able to use the existing GUMS installed on your site or install it yourself on the different node, following [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS Server Installation Guide ]] 

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * please distinguish between 'Engineering Considerations' and 'Requirements'
   * 'one node', is a requirement
   * a form of authorization (GUMS or gridmap) is a requirement
   * when you say 'components', do you mean packages provided by the VDT?
%ENDTWISTY%

%ENDSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart1"}% 
  
%STARTSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart2"}% 
The following questions should be answered before you can proceed with installation and  configuration of %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode storage element: 

   $ Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_ : You need to decide if you want to use grid-mapfile or !GUMS server for users’ authentication and authorization. More details about !GUMS could be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS GUMS Installation Guide]]. %BR% %BR% We currently recommend using GUMS as it provides superior flexibility and allows a site to manage all of its mappings in one central location; most large sites use GUMS.
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * delete question here and put authorization into requirements instead. This document should not provide help on how to decide for a form of authorization - at most link to the document that discusses that question.
%ENDTWISTY%

   $ Q. _How many !GridFTP servers you will need?_: You can choose to run multiple !GridFTP servers to achieve load balance and better performance. You will need to install additional servers if your Storage Element: 
   * is serving data to more than 250 cores for a VOs that use storage heavily (e.g. CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0)
   * is managing more than 50 TB of disk space
   * has more than 1Gbps bandwidth: plan on at least one !GridFTP server for each 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the server) if you want to maximize throughput. 

   $ Q. _Do you want to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_ : Yes!  The Gratia gridftp-transfer probes provide OSG storage statistics for accounting, much like the Gratia job accounting.  More details can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome  Gratia Home Page]]. The reported information will include the source and destination of transfer, certificate subject of transfer initiator, size and status of the transferred file. %BR% %BR% This probe captures only transfer statistics, hence it needs to be installed on your !GridFTP server.  If you do not run your !GridFTP server and %BESTMAN% server out of the same VDT installation, you will want to additionally install this probe on your other !GridFTP servers.
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * if the answer is 'Yes!', then the installation of the probe is mandatory. List it in components to be installed above and delete the question here. Make sure this documents covers the configuration of the probe.
%ENDTWISTY%

%ENDSECTION{"EngineeringConsiderationsPart2"}% 


   $ Q. _What kind of storage do you like to provide to your users?_: You may choose volatile cache(files are stored in storage for a fixed period of time), custodial cache (files are stored until explicitly deleted) or both. You can also allow users to write to specified areas that are outside %BESTMAN% managed cache. You will have to do your selection before before performing %BESTMAN% [[#BeStMan_Configuration][configuration]].


%STARTSECTION{"GetHelp"}% 
---+ How to get Help?

   * see the [[#DebugInfo][debugging section]] below for problems installing or operating the storage element
   * follow [[HelpProcedure][this procedure]] if you can't resolve the problem
   * contact the developers at osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org or srm@lbl.gov
%ENDSECTION{"GetHelp"}% 

%STARTSECTION{"Requirements"}% 

---+ Requirements

   1. all procedures in this document require _root_ privileges
   1. the installation procedure requires %LINK_PACMAN% version >= %PACMAN_VERSION% to be installed
   1. you will need at least 1 server to install the software
   1. the extended internet daemon [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinetd][xinetd]] must be installed and running on the server
   1. the server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Request_a_Host_Certificate][host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security=
   1. the operation of %BESTMAN% requires a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Request_a_Service_Certificate][service certificate]].
   1. the service certificate must be owned by the Unix user that is running %BESTMAN%
   1. the firewall must allow incoming connections to the %BESTMAN% ports (default:10080,10443)
   1. the firewall must allow incoming connections to the !GridFTP port (default 2811)
   1. outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.

%NOTE% Grid users will authenticate with your site using their grid certificates. The %LINK_OSG% provides [[ReleaseDocumentation/AboutAuthorizationForCE][several ways]] to allow users to authenticate with a site. If your site does not yet provide a form of authentication, the installation of =edg-mkgridmap= will be covered in this document.

%ENDSECTION{"Requirements"}% 

%STARTSECTION{"Installation"}%
---+ %BESTMAN% Installation Procedure 

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 verify the operation of =xinetd=
   1 verify the service certificate for %BESTMAN%
   1 create an installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install %BESTMAN%
   1 install the CA Certificates and the Certificate Revocation List
   1 execute the post installation script 

---++ Verify Xinetd Status

The !GridFTP service will be started by the =xinetd= service on connection requests. Please verify that =xinetd= is running:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% /etc/init.d/xinetd status
%RED%xinetd (pid xxxx) is running...%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

Otherwise consult the documentation provided with your operating system to find out how to install =xinetd=.

---++ Verify the Service Certificate for %BESTMAN%

By default %BESTMAN% is using the service certificate and key installed in =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem= respectively.  

%ICON{warning}% For the time being  %BESTMAN% should be configured with host certificate in order to be able to handle requests from !LCG-Utils tools. This is mandatory for at least all %BESTMAN% servers that support ATLAS experiment. A lot of users/scripts are using [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/LCGUtils][lcg-utils]] commands to access SE. If %BESTMAN% is configured to use a default (service) certificate then ==lcg-cp== command  fails because the certificate service name (which looks like http/hostname instead of just hostname or host/hostname) doesn't match the hostname.  That is why we do not recommend to configure %BESTMAN% with a service certificate.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_REVIEW%}%
   * this warning is problematic, because users following the requirements above just got a service certificate. Now they find out that this won't be needed.
   * while the information is important, it doesn't belong here using that level of detail. 
   * instead use following structure:
      * request and install the service certificate using [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Request_a_Service_Certificate instructions][this instructions]]
      * %NOTE% If you have a service certificate already installed in =/etc/grid-security/http=, create and use a new sub-directory to install the certificate for %BESTMAN% =/etc/grid-security/http/bestman=
      * %NOTE% if you are providing services to ATLAS, then do ...
   * provide instructions how to change mode and owner for the certificate only.
%ENDTWISTY%


There are two ways to solve this problem:
   * If you don't have a service certificate in the =/etc/grid-security/http== directory then  copy ==hostcert.pem==, ==hostkey.pem== into ==/etc/grid-security/http== and rename these two files to ==httpcert.pem==, ==httpkey.pem== respectively. Change ownership of these files and directory to ==600==.
<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cd /etc/grid-security
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$mkdir  http
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp hostcert.pem http/httpcert.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp hostkey.pem http/httpkey.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chown -R %RED%user.group%ENDCOLOR% http
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chmod 600 http/httpcert.pem http/httpkey.pem
</pre>
OR  
   * if you are already have a service certificate in  ==/etc/grid-security/http== directory and are using a service certificate for some other purpose then create a new directory  ==/etc/grid-security/bestmancert== and copy ==hostcert.pem==, ==hostkey.pem== into this directory under these names ==bestmancert.pem==, ==bestmankey.pem== respectively. Change the ownership of these files and directory. You will need to use relevant options to specify the certificate and the certificate key while configuring %BESTMAN%.
<pre class="rootscreen">
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cd /etc/grid-security
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$mkdir  bestmancert
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp hostcert.pem bestmancert/bestmancert.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$cp hostkey.pem bestmancert/bestmankey.pem
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chown -R %RED%user.group%ENDCOLOR% bestmancert
[root@%UCL_HOST% ~]$chmod 600 bestmancert/bestmancert.pem  bestmancert/bestmankey.pem
</pre>

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall" section="CreateInstallationDirectory"}%

---++ Use Pacman to Install %BESTMAN%

Now, we will use %LINK_PACMAN% to install %BESTMAN% in the current working directory (=%UCL_CWD%).

%NOTE% If you are using the [[InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][Grid User Management System (GUMS)]] as a Grid Identity Mapping Service, you will need to define the =$VDT_GUMS_HOST= environment variable first. Otherwise skip this step. 

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% export VDT_GUMS_HOST=%RED%&lt;your GUMS hostname&gt;%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>

To download  the %BESTMAN%  package from the %CACHE% cache execute the =pacman= command. Pacman will ask whether you want to "trust the caches and accept the license", answer =yall= and =y= to install the %BESTMAN% package:
 
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman
</pre>

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT%}%
<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman
Do you want to add [http://software-itb.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2] to [trusted.caches]? (y/n/yall): yall

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
                                             

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
%ENDTWISTY%
</pre>



Please check the installation log file =%UCL_CWD%/vdt-install.log= for errors if the installation failed. Otherwise proceed.

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall" section="UpdateEnvironment"}%

%ENDSECTION{"Installation"}%

<!-- instructions to install and enable CA Certificates and the CRL -->
---++ Install a Certificate Authority Package

You will need to install a %LINK_GLOSSARY_CA% package. For more information and options see [[ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall#Install_a_Certificate_Authority][this document]].

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="LocalInstallation" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="EnableCACertificates" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="EnableCRL" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%

%STARTSECTION{"PostInstall"}%
---++ Run the Post-Install Script

At last run the =vdt-post-install= script to finish the installation:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% vdt-post-install
Starting...
Configuring PRIMA... Done.
Configuring EDG-Make-Gridmap... Done.
Done.
</pre>

This completes the installation of the %BESTMAN% server. Move to the next section to configure the %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode and !GridFTP server. You may also choose to configure the Gratia transfer probe at this time (see [[#Engineering_Considerations][this section]] for detailed explanation).

If you want to install additional !GridFTP servers on the different nodes, please follow [[GsiFtpStandAlone][this document for !GridFTP server installation]]. See [[#Engineering_Considerations][this section]] for reasoning. 

%ENDSECTION{"PostInstall"}%

---+ %BESTMAN% Configuration

You will need to configure %BESTMAN% first in order to enable it as a service. The configuration process is controlled by a %BESTMAN% configuration script ( =$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/setup/configure= ). The full list of %BESTMAN% configuration options is provided by the [[http://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman/docs/bestman-guide.html][Bestman Administrative Guide]].

If you are using grid-mapfile for authorization, then the simplest configuration command for your %BESTMAN% installation is shown below:

<pre class="rootscreen">
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT% %UCL_CWD%/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y
</pre>

This command will configure %BESTMAN% using following defaults:

   * run by Unix user =daemon=
   * use certificate =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and certificate key =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=
   * listen on secure port =10443= and public port =10080=
   * utilize gridftp server running on the server on port =2811=
   * use grid-mapfile for authorization

If you are using GUMS for authorization, the simplest configuration command will be:

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y \</br>
        --cert %RED%bestman_service_cert%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --key  %RED%bestman_service_key%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-host %RED%GUMS_hostname%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-port %RED%GUMS_port%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>
Where 
   * ==bestman_service_cert==  is a path to service certificate 
   * ==bestman_service_key==  is a path to service certificate private key

%ICON{"warning"}% Please, see [[#Requirements][Requirements]] and [[#Verify_Service_Certificate_for_B][Verify Service Certificate]] section for more details

   * ==GUMS_hostname== is !FQDN name of  !GUMS server,
   * ==GUMS_port==  is the port of !GUMS  server

This command will install %BESTMAN% that will be configured to
   * run  by user ==daemon==,
   * listen on secure port 10443 and public port 10080
   * utilize  gridftp server running on the same host on 2811 port
   * use GUMS for authorization
 
It is important to notice that %RED%--server y%ENDCOLOR% should be always specified, otherwise the VDT =configure_bestman= script disables the bestman server and then it needs to be turned on again with the =vdt-control --on bestman=.


%STARTSECTION{"ComplexConfiguration"}%
More advanced command that allows you to use GUMS authorization, specified non-default ports for %BESTMAN% and !GridFTP ports range, multiple gridftp servers, etc is shown below:

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%vdt/setup/configure_bestman  --server y \</br>
        --user %RED%user%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --cert %RED%bestman_service_cert%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --key  %RED%bestman_service_key%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --http-port %RED%public_port%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --https-port %RED%secure_port%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --globus-tcp-port-range %RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --volatile-file-lifetime %RED%lifetime%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --cache-size %RED%cache_size%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-host %RED%GUMS_hostname%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --gums-port %RED%GUMS_port%ENDCOLOR% \</br>
        --with-transfer-servers %RED%GridFTP_servers_list%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>



Where :
| *Argument Value* | *Default Value* | *Comment*| 
| ==user==| daemon | name of the non-privileged user that runs %BESTMAN% server process|
| ==bestman_service_cert==| /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem|is a path to service certificate|

|==secure_port==|10443|%BESTMAN% private port  %ICON{"warning"}% Please, make sure that these two ports are open if  you have a firewall on your node|
|==low_port,high_port==|N/A| the open ports range that is allowed for all outbound globus connections for gridftp (see also how to deal with firewall in [[#GridFTP_Configuration][ in this section]])|
|==cache_size==|disk partition| the size of volatile cache area in MB allocated for storage|
|==lifetime==|30 minutes| the time in seconds that file stored in %BESTMAN% volatile cache will be available|
|==GUMS_hostname==|localhost|is the FQDN name of  !GUMS server|
|==GUMS_port==|8443| is the port of !GUMS  server|
|==GridFTP_servers_list==|localhost| is a list !FQDN of your !GridFTP servers, separated by ; . e.g. “gsiftp://host1.domain.tld;gsiftp://host2.domain.tld”|
  

This command will allow you to configure %BESTMAN% that will manage a volatile space located under ==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/cache directory==. The size of the area will be controlled by specified  ==cache_size== or by size of the disk partition. The files that are stored at this area will be available ONLY during ==lifetime== period.

If you want to create a custodial storage place where files could be stored unless they are explicitly deleted by user you will need to add the following options to the configuration above:
<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>--with-custodial-storage-path %RED%path%ENDCOLOR% /</br>
--with-custodial-storage-size %RED%size%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>
Where
   * ==path== is the path to custodial storage
   * ==size== is the size of custodial storage in MB

If you would like also add other areas where people may store the data, you can use one of the following options:
<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>--with-allowed-paths  %RED%list_of_accessible_paths%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>
or 
<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>-- with-blocked-paths  %RED%list_of_non-accessible_paths%ENDCOLOR%</code>
</pre>

Where:
   * ==list_of_accessible_paths== list of directories, separated by semicolon, accessible to users. If not specified, ==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/cache== directory will be used to store volatile data . %ICON{warning}%  Keep in mind that %BESTMAN% will not be able to manage space in  the areas specified in the list unless it is not also specified as custodial area.

   * ==list_of_non-accessible_paths== list of directories separated by semicolon, non-accessible to users (default are "/;/etc;/var") . 

Only one of the ==--with-allowed-paths==,== --with-blocked-paths options== should be used.


More configuration options could be found with ==--help== option.


%STARTSECTION{"SudoersFile"}%


---++ Sudoers File Modification

%ICON{"warning"}%Please, make the appropriate modification to ==/etc/sudoers== described in the %BESTMAN% documentation, namely add the following lines to this file: 
<pre class="file">
<code>
# Comment out this line, if it is in your ==/etc/sudoers== file (RHEL5+)
#Defaults    requiretty

Cmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/ls 
Runas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root

 </pre>

==user_name== is the account running %BESTMAN% server process. %BR%

%BESTMAN% server will not be able to handle user requests, if this step is missed.
%ENDSECTION{"SudoersFile"}%
%ENDSECTION{"ComplexConfiguration"}%

%STARTSECTION{"GridFTPConfiguration"}%
#GridFTP  
---++ !GridFTP  Configuration

!GridFTP server comes with %BESTMAN% installation and have to be configured if used with it GUMS authorization method.

If you are using GUMS authorization method, please, copy the following two files from ==$VDT_LOCATION/post-install== to  ==/etc/grid-security==. Otherwise go to the next [[#NextStep1][step]]: 
 <pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security</code> 
</pre>


#NextStep1
If you have a firewall, the open port range for the gridftp should be properly set. In order to do so you will have to modify ==vdt-local-setup.sh== and ==vdt-local-setup.csh== files
<pre class="file">
<code>
#edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=%RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR%
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=%RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR%
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE </code>
</pre>

Where ==low_port, high_port==  controls all outbound globus connections for gridftp (e.g 40000,49150). You should select the same range of ports you have selected during %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode configuration with  --globus-tcp-port-range %RED%low_port,high_port%ENDCOLOR% option.

You can have multiple installation of  !GridFTP servers located on  the nodes you have specified in %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE% mode configuration (see  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GsiFtpStandAlone][separate !GridFTP installation]] if you want to install it as a stand-alone server).

You will need to make sure that users have write permissions in to the storage area.

---+ Integration with the information system

Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. See the topic [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Providers]]. The SE does not collect or publish information independently.


---+ Validation of Service Operation
%STARTSECTION{"Testing"}%
---++ Site registration and daily monitoring

Once you have your SE setup and configured, you can register it with the [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/sitereg/][LBNL SRM monitoring system]]. This will run daily tests against your SE and the results can be viewed [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/osg/][here]].

---++ Self-testing with srm clients

In order to verify that the system is functional you will need to have access to srm client commands, be able to create a proxy certificate (==grid-proxy-init== or ==voms_proxy_init== command) and have access to your certificate and private key.

There are multiple ways of doing this.
%ENDSECTION{"Testing"}%
%STARTSECTION{"ClientInstall"}%
---+++ Preparing to run srm-client command on the %BESTMAN% node
If you don't have an access to the  node where [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client]] is installed  you can still test %BESTMAN%.
   * Login on the %BESTMAN% node as "yourself"
   * Setup location of %BESTMAN% installation
<pre class="screen">
<code>source %UCL_CWD%/setup.sh</code>
</pre>

Make sure that you have access to your certificate and private key on that node. You will need it to create a proxy certificate. Execute grid-proxy-init :

</pre>

You will need to add the path to all the srm client commands to your ==PATH== environment variable. 
<pre class="screen">
<code>export PATH=$PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/bin</code>
</pre>

---+++ Preparing to run srm-client command from the different node

 You may have an access to the node where OSG client is already installed and  where you have your certificate and key. If you want to install OSG Client use instructions  provided in [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][in that installation Guide]]. Then generate a proxy certificate by issuing ==grid_proxy_init== or _voms_proxy_init_:
<pre class="screen">
<code>source %RED%VDT_LOCATION%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:</code>
</pre>

or

<pre class="screen">
<code>source %RED%VDT_LOCATION%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh
voms-proxy-init -voms %RED%VO%ENDCOLOR%
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:</code>
</pre>
Where  ==VDT_LOCATION== is the directory where the client is installed and ==VO== name of your Virtual Organization.

---+++ Executing SRM-client commands 

After you create a proxy certificate, you may try to verify %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode with srm client commands:

Execute srm-ping:

%STARTSECTION{"Troubleshooting"}%
---+ Troubleshooting
---++ File Locations

You could find log and configuration files for each of the module in the following location: 
| *Module Name* |  *Configuration files* | *Log files* | 
|%BESTMAN% | $VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc | $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log<br/>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/bestman.log | 
|!GridFTP |$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/vdt-run-gsiftp.sh.env| $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log<br/> $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log |

---++ Open Ports

The following ports are opened for the installed services
|*Module Name*|*Port Number*| *Protocol*|
|%BESTMAN%| default 10080| tcp|
||default 10443|tcp|
|!GridFTP|2811|tcp|
||lowPort,maxPort if needed to control outbound globus connections|tcp|  

#DebugInfo

---++ Debugging Procedure
If  system validation failed, you would probably need to check the each component in order 
to verify your installation. In order to do so you should check all of them in the following order: 
   * !GUMS (if in use) 
   * !GridFTP 
   * %BESTMAN% 

---+++ Verifying !GUMS 

Make sure that the service certificate you specified for %BESTMAN%  configuration with  
==--cert service_cert== , ==--key service_key==  options and !GridFTP service certificate are 
accepted by !GUMS  (see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS Installation Documentation]])   
 
Get mapping ==uid== for your certificate and verify that this ==uid== exists on %BESTMAN% and !GridFTP node. 
 
---+++ Verifying !GridFTP 

Login on the node where you have installed have your certificate installed and  access to %CACHE%:wn_client or  %CACHE%:client.

You will need to get your ==voms-proxy== or ==grid_proxy== certificate see [[Validation of Service Operation][this section]] : 

Then test !GridFTP: 
<pre class="screen">
<code>source %RED%VDT_LOCATION%ENDCOLOR%/setup.sh 
echo “This is a test” >/tmp/test 
globus-url-copy -dbg file:///tmp/test gsiftp://%RED%GridFtp_host%ENDCOLOR%/tmp/test 
</pre>

Check the !GridFTP logs if you have encountered any errors.

---+++ Verifying %BESTMAN%-%BESTMAN_TYPE%-mode

First, make sure that %BESTMAN% is running: 
<pre class="screen">
# ps auxww|grep $VDT_LOCATION/bestman|grep -v grep
daemon   27648  0.0  0.0  4944 1168 pts/2    S    07:46   0:00 /bin/sh /usr/local/osg-bestman/bestman/sbin/bestman.server
daemon   27676  3.3  7.4 715240 155208 pts/2 Sl   07:46   1:59 /usr/local/osg-bestman/jdk1.6/bin/java -server -Xmx512m -Dorg.globus.tcp.port.range=20000,25000 -DX509_CERT_DIR=/usr/local/osg-bestman/globus/TRUSTED_CA -Daxis.ServerConfigFile=/usr/local/osg-bestman/bestman/conf/server-config.wsdd gov.lbl.srm.server.Server /usr/local/osg-bestman/bestman/conf/bestman.rc
</pre>

If %BESTMAN% is not running check information in that log files ==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log== and  ==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/bestman.log==.

There is no error in the log file (==$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log==)
