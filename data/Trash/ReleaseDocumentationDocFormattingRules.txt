---+++ General TWiki formatting information
   * A on (long) one page description of the TWiki concepts for controlling formatting, creating lists, creating tables, etc. can be found in TWiki.TextFormattingRules.
---+++ Rules for topics
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+ *<nop>Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!  If you want to spell out a title whose TWiki name has abbreviations, do that.
   * All level two sections should be in title case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the Installation=
   * All sections (level three and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---+++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * Exclude from the TOC all sections level three and below (=---+++=, =---++++=, etc.).  To accomplish this,  use !%TOC{depth="2"}% to produce the table of contents.

---+++ Composite documents and templates
   * [[DocExampleMainTopic]] for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * [[DocExampleTopicInclude]] for a topic likely to included in other topics, so =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= and =EDITTHIS= directives are used.  Note that heading levels have to be coordinated between the parent and included documents.  In general it is better not to have level one or two heading in included documents to allow the parent to control the TOC that contains level two headings.
   * [[DocExampleCompositeTopic]] what a composite document of includes should look like.
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Avoid nested INCLUDES.
   * Here is the !WebTopicEditTemplate (now DocInstallTemplate) for newly created pages in this twiki, which are assumed to be included in other topics.

---+++ Screen View
Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:

For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a "screen" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>

---+++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a "file" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>

---+++ Warnings and Notes
   * See Documentation.DocumentationTeam.DocWarningsAndNotes

---+++ Reviewing tools

   * See ReleaseDocumentation.ReviewStatus.

---+++ Comments
A comment section (like the one below) should be added at the bottom of each page using a code like:
<pre>
---++ Comments
%<nop>COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
</pre>
---+++ Comments
%COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
