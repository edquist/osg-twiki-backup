---++ About This Document
%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for those people who write, edit, or review documents in the official OSG documentation TWiki.  It describes the formatting standards, methods used to structure composite documents, and formatting tools that automatically format certain types of information.

---++ General TWiki formatting information
   * A description of the TWiki concepts for controlling formatting, creating lists, creating tables, etc. can be found in TWiki.TextFormattingRules.
   * All the "rules" that follow should be used in most cases, but always use your best judgment.
---+++ Rules for topics and section headings
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+ *<nop>Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!  If you want to spell out a title whose TWiki name has abbreviations, do that.
   * All level two sections should be in title case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the Installation=
   * All sections (level three and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---+++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * To prevent the Table of Contents from becoming too long and confusing, exclude from the TOC detailed sections (typically level three or four) and below.  To accomplish this,  use !%TOC{depth="2"}% or !%TOC{depth="3"}% to produce the table of contents.

---++ Composite documents and templates
   * DocExampleMainTopic for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * DocExampleTopicInclude for a topic likely to be included in other topics, so =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= and =EDITTHIS= directives are used.  Note that heading levels have to be coordinated between the parent and included documents.  In general it is better not to have level one or two headings in included documents to allow the parent to control the TOC that contains level two headings.
   * DocExampleCompositeTopic what a composite document of includes should look like.
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Avoid nested INCLUDES (i.e. including a file that itself has an INCLUDE).
   * Here is the !WebTopicEditTemplate (now DocInstallTemplate) for newly created pages in this twiki.  Once you create the new page, any other template (or content of your choice) can be pasted into the new page.

---++ Formatting Tools
The following sections describe tools available to easily format certain information to make it consistently recognizable and useful to the reader.

---+++ Screen View
Many documents refer to unix commands, output from a script, a set of lines that should be edited in a file (like a configuration file), or a program listing.  These should be set off in a standard way as follows:

For a set of commands that can be copied and input or a dump of the screen results from running a script uses a "screen" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="screen">
command 1
command 2
</pre>

---+++ File View
For a set of lines in a file to be edited or the contents of a file uses a "file" view:
<verbatim>
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
</verbatim>
which looks like:
<pre class="file">
line 1
line 2
</pre>
%NOTE% If the lines in the file contain html or TWiki variables, you will have to use verbatim /verbatim html tags (enclosed in <>) to prevent them from being interpreted.

---+++ Notes
Notes are asides about the contents of the text that provide specific information that particular, but not all, users may need. Notes are less necessary than *Importants* and unlike *Warnings*, may not cause harm if ignored.

   * Usage<br>
   To create a note, insert the =<nop>%NOTE<nop>%= variable, followed by a single space and your text:
   <verbatim> %NOTE% Here is my note text. </verbatim>
   * Example
   %NOTE% Something that I want you to know about and pay some attention to.
<!-- ======BEGIN THE SECTION FOR INCLUDING ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Notes" }%
   $ %H% *%RED% NOTE %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Notes" }%
====== END SECTION ====== -->

---+++ Importants
*Importants* are asides from your normal text that you want to highlight so that skimming users will not ignore them. Unlike Warnings, they will not cause grave harm to the system or the person if ignored. The difference between a *Note* and an *Important* is up to the writer.
   * Usage<br>
   Importants are included by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%IMPORTANT<nop>%= followed by a single space and your important text:
   <verbatim> %IMPORTANT% Some text about the important thing. </verbatim>
   * Example
   %IMPORTANT% Don't forget to include a single space or the *Important* will not work.
<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Importants"}%
   $ %X% *%GREEN% IMPORTANT %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Importants"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->

---+++ Warnings
*Warnings* are set off from the regular flow of the text to especially warn the reader about an action that could cause harm to the system or to the user. It's less than something that should be labeled *DANGER* but more harmful than something that you would put into an *Important*. 

If something that you are instructing a user to do could take up the CPU for several minutes, you should put in a *Warning*.
   * Usage<br>
   Warnings are added by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%WARNING<nop>%= followed by a single space and your text.
   <verbatim> %WARNING% Some text here. </verbatim>
   * Example
   %WARNING% If ignore me, you'll regret it.
<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Warnings"}%
   $ %X% *%RED% WARNING! %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Warnings"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->

---+++ Tips
Tips might be used to suggest an alternative that would be better under certain circumstances.
   * Usage<br>
   Tips are added by putting, on a new line, =<nop>%TIP<nop>%= followed by a single space and your text.
   <verbatim> %TIP% Some text here. </verbatim>
   * Example
   %TIP% It is really best if you do it this way.
<!-- ====== BEGIN INCLUDE SECTION ======
%STARTSECTION{ "Tips"}%
   $ %H% *%GREEN% TIP %ENDCOLOR%*: 
%ENDSECTION{ "Tips"}%
====== END SECTION ====== -->

---+++ Comments
A comment section (like the one below) should be added at the bottom of each page using a code like:
<pre>
---++ Comments
%<nop>COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
</pre>
%NOTE% Comments made during document review/testing should be addressed by the owner and removed prior to release.
---++ Comments
%COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
