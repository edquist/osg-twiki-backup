---++ Introduction
The VDT cleanup scripts are designed to help remove files that accumulate on the system over time.  The initial goal of the scripts is to remove Globus cruft, such as in the GLOBUS_LOCATION/tmp and in grid user's .globus directories.

The scripts are distributed in the VDT-Cleanup package which is included in a standard CE install as of OSG 1.2.30.

---+++!! Applicable Versions
The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.30* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
The framework for the scripts allows customization to do any cleanup.  However, the scripts that are distributed out of the box are only applicable for a CE system.

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].

If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following this ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure.

---++ First Time Install
This service will be automatically installed with a CE.  If you are updating a CE from a version of OSG prior to 1.2.30 you will need to add the following settings to your =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file.

; As of OSG 1.2.30 cleanup scripts are included to help delete old files                             
; For more information see the Twiki:

; The age in days after which files should be deleted.

; The user's home directories that should be cleaned up.  The default value                          
; is @vo-file.  This will open osg-user-vo-map.txt and try to get the list                           
; of users from this file.  Alternatively you can specify a whitespace separated                     
; list of users.                                                                                     
cleanup_users_list = @vo-file

; The cron time at which the cleanup script will run.  By default it will run                        
; once a day during the night.
