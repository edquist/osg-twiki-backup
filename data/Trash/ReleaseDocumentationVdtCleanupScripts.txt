---+++ Adding new Cleanup Scripts
When =vdt-cleanup= runs it will run all scripts it finds in the =VDT_LOCATION/vdt/cleanup= directory.  New cleanup scripts can be installed in this directory.  They must be owned by root/root, and permission 0700.

Scripts will be passed the following environment variables:
| *Variable* | *Info* |
| VDT_LOCATION | Location of the VDT installation. |
| VDT_CLEANUP_AGE | The age, in days, after which files should be deleted. |
| VDT_CLEANUP_USER_FILE | A path to a file containing a list of user accounts and home directories to clean up.  The format is: &lt;user&gt; &lt;path to home dir&gt; |
