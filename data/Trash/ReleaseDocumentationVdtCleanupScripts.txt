---++ Introduction
The VDT cleanup scripts are designed to help remove files that accumulate on the system over time.  The initial goal of the scripts is to remove files created by Globus that are old and unneeded, but were not cleaned up, such as in the GLOBUS_LOCATION/tmp and in grid user's .globus directories.

Currently the areas cleaned up are:
   * The =VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp= directory
   * The user's gass cache (=~USER/.globus/.gass_cache=)
   * The user's Globus job directory (=~USER/.globus/job=)
   * The user's extra Globus files in their home directory such as gram_job_mgr logs and gram_scratch directories.

The user's home directories will be cleaned up as the user themself.  This is both safer and also allows the cleanup script to work when home directories are located on a root squashed NFS filesystem.

Extra scripts can be placed in a directory to do any site-specific cleanup.  More information on cleaning up Globus files can be found in the (not worker-node specific) [[HandyWorkerNodeScripts]]

---+++!! Applicable Versions
The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.20* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
The framework for the scripts allows customization to do any cleanup.  However, the scripts that are distributed out of the box are only applicable for a CE system.

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].
%BR%
If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following this ReleaseDocumentation.HelpProcedure.

---++ First Time Install
This service will be automatically installed with a CE.  If you are updating a CE from a version of OSG prior to 1.2.20 you will need to add the following settings to your =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file.

%RED%Important:%ENDCOLOR% If you set the age to 14 days, jobs that run for longer than 14 days may be killed because necessary files are cleaned up from the =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/tmp= directory.  You should set this value to a number of days higher than you expect your long running jobs to take to complete.  If this is a problem for you then do not run the vdt-cleanup script (keep it disabled) and report this to =vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org=.

<pre class="screen">
; As of OSG 1.2.20 cleanup scripts are included to help delete old files

cleanup_cron_time = 15 1 * * *
</pre>

---++ Installation Procedure
The scripts will be automatically installed along with a CE.

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
The service is run as a cron job.  It can be started and stopped using =vdt-control=.  Look for the =vdt-cleanup= service.

---++ Adding new Cleanup Scripts
When =vdt-cleanup= runs it will run all scripts it finds in the =VDT_LOCATION/vdt/cleanup-scripts= directory.  New cleanup scripts can be installed in this directory.  They must be owned by root/root, and permission 0700.

Scripts will be passed the following environment variables:
| *Variable* | *Info* |
| VDT_LOCATION | Location of the VDT installation. |
| VDT_CLEANUP_AGE | The age, in days, after which files should be deleted. |
| VDT_CLEANUP_USER_FILE | A path to a file containing a list of user accounts and home directories to clean up.  The format is: &lt;user&gt; &lt;path to home dir&gt; |

---++ Validation of Service Operation

#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Information
---+++!!File Locations
The log file for this service are located in =VDT_LOCATION/logs/vdt-cleanup.log=

---+++!!Debugging Procedure
   * Run the program with the =--dry-run= option and inspect the output.  No work will be done.
   * Run the program manually and inspect the log file.

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
None known currently.

---+++!!References
The scripts that are distributed with the package are based off scripts from [[HandyWorkerNodeScripts]].
