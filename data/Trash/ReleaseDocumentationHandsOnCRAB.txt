---++ Introduction

This hands on will introduce you to CRAB at a basic level. At the end of this exercise, you should be able to install CRAB on a properly prepare machine and submit simple jobs to run on the GRID. For more complex uses of CRAB akin to the use cases for physicists, please see the resources under "More information."

---++ Requirements

To install CRAB on your own machine, you should have installed the gLite 3.2 client UI, available from http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite/packages/R3.2/sl5_x86_64/deployment/glite-UI/glite-UI.asp I have generally found that the tarball UI is easier, or at least more foolproof, to install than the RPM based UI. Some uses of CRAB may work with the OSG client only, but this is not a recommended or supported set up.

To submit jobs to the Grid, you need CRAB installed, at least one release of CMSSW installed, and a Grid certificate with the CMS VOMS membership. This hands on covers CRAB installation. CMSSW installation is covered by Patrick's section, and certificate issues should already have been dealt with in the requirements before the workshop started.
