---++ Introduction
!BeStMan-Gateway, developed by the Scientific Data Management Group of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is a generic SRM v2.2 load balancing frontend for transfer servers. It works on top of existing disk-based POSIX-compliant file systems, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, GPFS, PVFS2, GFS, Ibrix, HFS+, Hadoop, !XrootdFS and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp. This document is written for system administrators who are planning to use storage that is installed on top of a POSIX-compliant file system. The goal of this document is to give enough information for system administrators to do initial simple configuration of the storage as well as provide references to the documents that may help to accomplish more sophisticated configuration. 

For general information on storage software architecture, implementations and use, please read [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/StorageInfrastructureSoftware][StorageInfrastractureSoftware]]. For information on planning, installing and validating storage software, please follow this link to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/StorageSiteAdministrator][StorageSiteAdministrator]].

---+++!! Applicable Versions
The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
%OSG_VERSION% 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
!BeStMan-Gateway storage could be installed on one node and the installation cache consists of the following components: 
   * !BeStMan-Gateway is an implementation of SRM v2.2 for essential interfaces to disk based storage systems - [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman][BeStMan Home Page]] 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp][GridFTP documentation]]. 
   * POSIX-compliant file system
   * optional package
      * Gratia gridftp transfer probe - cron job that reports all the file transfers to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector Gratia collector]]
   * If you want that !BeStMan to use GUMS for authorization, you should be able to access GUMS server that is installed on your site or installed it yourself on a different node, following [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS Server Installation Guide ]] 
<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/bestman_gateway_arch.jpeg" alt="bestman_gateway_arch.jpeg" width='384' height='288' />
 
The following questions should be answered before you can proceed with installation and 
configuration of !BeStMan-Gateway storage solution: 
 
   $ Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_ : You need to decide if you want to use grid-mapfile or !GUMS server for users’ authentication and authorization. More details about !GUMS could be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS GUMS Installation Guide]]. %BR% %BR% We currently recommend using GUMS as it provides superior flexibility and allows a site to manage all of its mappings in one central location; most large sites use GUMS.
 
   $ Q. _Do you need to support space tokens?_ : !BeStMan-Gateway supports predefined, static space tokens that could be included in configuration. It doesn't keep track or enforce the contents of static space tokens.  If you want to partition your storage space and have a “designated” space for some VOs or users, you can choose to use space tokens. You will have to provide the names and descriptions of the tokens as well as the size of the area.  

   $ Q. _How many !GridFTP servers you will need?_: You can choose to run multiple !GridFTP servers to achieve load balance and better performance. 

   $ Q. _Do you want to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_ : Yes!  The Gratia gridftp-transfer probes provide much-desired statistics that OSG uses for accounting, much like the Gratia job accounting.  More details can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome  Gratia Home Page]]. The reported information will include the source and destination of transfer, certificate subject of transfer initiator, size and status of the transferred file. %BR% %BR% This probe captures transfer statistics, hence it needs to be installed on your !GridFTP server.  If you do not run your !GridFTP server and !BeStMan server out of the same VDT installation, you will want to additionally install this probe on your other !GridFTP servers.

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].
%BR%
If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following this InstallHelpProcedure.

---++Checklist
   1. [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >= %PACMAN_VERSION% is required
   1. The server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security/=
   1. !BeStMan server needs to have a valid host certificate installed in =/etc/grid-security/bestmancert=. The certificate should be own by a user that is running !BeStMan server. The right permission (600) should be set on those files. %ICON{warning}%  !BeStMan should be configured with host certificate in order to be able to handle requests from !LCG-Utils tools. This is mandatory for at least all !BeStMan servers that support ATLAS experiment. Normally the OSG !BeStMan implementation uses a service certificate, not a host certificate. This causes lcg-cp to fail because the certificate name (which looks like http/hostname instead of just hostname) doesn't match the hostname. 
   1. The firewall must allow incoming connections to the !GridFTP port (default 2811). Outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.
   1. A working GUMS server or a gridmap-file are needed for authorization using grid certificates.

---++ !BeStMan Installation Procedure
Login as root and check if pacman version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is installed:
<pre class="screen">
su root
cd &lt;PACMAN3.28_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
pacman -version
</pre>

Next,  create an installation directory and change to this directory. This directory will later be used to get the !BeStMan package  from the %CACHE% cache.

<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/osg_%OSG_VERSION%-bestman/
cd /opt/osg_%OSG_VERSION%-bestman/
</pre>

If you are using GUMS authorization method you will need to setup _VDT_GUMS_HOST_ environment variable, if you are using  gridmap-file ,please, proceed to the next step.
<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt;GUMS hostname&gt;  
</pre>

Finally, execute pacman to get the !BeStMan package from the %CACHE% cache. Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=).
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman
</pre>
The install procedure will print out a warning:
<verbatim>
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</verbatim>

The information provided in the README is out of date. Please setup the CA certificates in the following way instead:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local -url osg
</pre>
This command will download certificates distributed by the OSG to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= and create a symlink from =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to that location. [[VDTCAManage][Other options]] are also available.

To reflect the changes update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. To see all services available use =vdt-control -list=
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
vdt-control --list
</pre>
This completes the installation of the !BeStMan server. Move to the next section to configure the !BeStMan and !GridFTP servers. You may also chose to configure Gratia transfer probe at this time.
If you want to install additional !GridFTP servers on the different nodes, please, follow [[GsiFtpStandAlone][this document]]


---++ !BeStMan-Gateway Configuration

You will need to configure !BeStMan-Gateway first in order to enable it as a service. !BeStMan should run under non-root account.

The simplest configuration example is shown below. It utilizes all the default values including the default path to certificate and key ( ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem==, ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem==) that should have the right set of permission and belong to user ==daemon==. See [[#Checklist][Checklist]] for details.In this configuration !BeStMan runs as user ==daemon==. 

<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
source setup.sh 
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y --enable-gateway
</pre>

This command will install !BeStMan that will be 
   * running  by user ==daemon==,
   * using certificate  ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem== and certificate key ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem==
   * listening on secure port 10443 and public port 10080
   * utilizing  gridftp server running on the same host on 2811 port
   * using gridmap-file for authorization
%ICON{warning}% This configuration command doesn't specify any storage area for !BeStMan , so the user will be able to write files only in the directories she can access (e.g ==/tmp==). 
If you don't want to try more complex configuration, you may proceed to [[#Sudoers_File_Modification][this]] subsection.
  

The more complex installation example is shown below:
  
The example below shows how to configure !BeStMan in gateway-mode, enable !GUMS
and space token usage. If you would like to use pre-defined, static space tokens you need to provide a list of  space token names, description and size of space allocated for each token. Keep in mind that in gateway-mode, !BeStMan is not managing your space. 

<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
source setup.sh 
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y \ 
--user &lt;user&gt; \ 
--cert &lt;service_cert&gt;  \ 
--key  &lt;service_key&gt;  \ 
--http-port  &lt;public_port&gt;  \ 
--https-port  &lt;secured_port&gt;  \ 
--gums-host  &lt;GUMS hostname&gt;  \ 
--gums-port  &lt;GUMS port number&gt;  \ 
--enable-gateway  \ 
--with-allowed-paths "&lt;allowed_dir_list&gt;"  \ 
--with-blocked-paths "&lt;blocked_dir_list&gt;"  \ 
--with-tokens-list  "&lt;TOKEN_1_NAME&gt;[desc:&lt;TOKEN_1_DESC&gt;][&lt;TOKEN_1_SIZE_GB&gt;];&lt;TOKEN_2_NAME&gt;[desc:&lt;TOKEN_2_DESC&gt;][&lt;TOKEN_2_SIZE&gt;]"   \ 
--with-transfer-servers  &lt;GridFTP server list&gt;  
</pre> 
 
Where  _user_ name of the non-privileged user that runs !BeStMan, <br/>
_service_cert_  path to service certificate </br>
_service_key_  path to service certificate private key</br> 

%ICON{"warning"}% *the certificate file and key  should belong to the user* - Please, see [[#Checklist][Checklist]]. 

%ICON{warning}%  !BeStMan should be configured with host certificate in order to be able to handle requests from !LCG-Utils tools. This is mandatory for at least all !BeStMan servers that support ATLAS experiment. Normally the OSG !BeStMan implementation uses a service certificate, not a host certificate. This causes lcg-cp to fail because the certificate name (which looks like http/hostname instead of just hostname) doesn't match the hostname. 

<br/>
_public_port_http_ public port (default : 10080;commonly used port is 8080 unless there is a conflict) <br/> 
_secured_port_http_ private port (default: 10443;commonly used port is 8443 unless there is a conflict) <br/> 
_allowed_dir_list_ list of directories, separated by semicolon, accessible to users. If not specified $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/cache directory will be used to store data.<br/>
_blocked_dir_list_ list of directories separated by semicolon, non-accessible to users (default are "/;/etc;/var") . One of the  --with-allowed-paths / --with-blocked-paths options should be used.<br/>
_GUMS hostname_ the name of  !GUMS server, <br/> 
_GUMS port number_ the port of !GUMS  server, <br/>   
token list format: _token_name[KEY:VALUE][token_size_inGB]_ where:
   * KEY = desc, owner, retention, latency, path, usedBytesCommand. All KEY:VALUE pairs are optional
   *  retention available values = CUSTODIAL, OUTPUT, REPLICA
   * latency  available values = ONLINE, NEARLINE
   * usedBytesCommand = e.g. some custom script or "du -s -b". Its output shall have the available bytes as the first value
   * multiple token names are separated by semi-colon
For example:

"USATLASDATA1[desc:USATLASDATA1][owner:atlas][retention:REPLICA][latency:ONLINE][path:/project/usatlas/data][usedBytesCommand:/usr/bin/du -s -b][120]"




 _GridFTP server list_  is a list !FQDN of your !GridFTP servers, separated by ; . e.g. 
“gsiftp://host1.domain.tld;gsiftp://host2.domain.tld” 
If not specified the local hostname will be used as a name of !GridFTP server.
<br/> 

If you want to use gridmap-file for user authentication and authorization do not specify  the following options:
 
 --gums-host   

 --gums-port 
 
If you do not want to use pre-defined, static space tokens, do not specify the following 
options: 

--with-tokens-list 
If you are running your !BeStMan-Gateway on the node that doesn’t have an access to 
your file system, you will have to modify the following attributes in _$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc_
configuration file: 
<pre class="screen"> 
checkSizeWithFS=false 
checkSizeWithGsiftp=true 
</pre>


---+++ Sudoers File Modification

%ICON{"warning"}%Please, make the appropriate modification to ==/etc/sudoers== described in the !BeStMan documentation, namely add the following lines to this file: 
<pre class="file">
# Comment out this line, if it is in your ==/etc/sudoers== file (RHEL5+)
#Defaults    requiretty

Cmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/ls 
Runas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root 
&lt;user_name&gt; ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD 
 </pre>

Please keep in mind that this is just an example, you can choose more  be more restrictive policy for your site.
!BeStMan server will not be able to run if this step is missed.



#GridFTP  
---++ !GridFTP  Configuration
!GridFTP server comes with !BeStMan installation. 

If you are using GUMS authorization method, please, copy the following two files from _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install_ to in _/etc/grid-security_, otherwise skip this step: 
 <pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>

If you are dealing with firewall the gridftp port range should be properly set. In order to do so you will have to modify ==vdt-local-setup.sh== and ==vdt-local-setup.csh==
<pre class="file">
#edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh 
GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=&lt;low_port,high_port&gt;
GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=&lt;low_port,high_port&gt;
export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE
export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE
</pre>

Where _low_port,high_port_ - controls all outbound globus connections for gridftp (e.g 40000,49150)

You can have multiple installation of  !GridFTP servers located on  the nodes you have 
specified in !BeStMan-Gateway configuration (see  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GsiFtpStandAlone][standalone !GridFTP installation]] if you want to install it as a standalone server).

You will need to make sure that users have write permission in to the storage area.  

---+++ Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe Configuration
If you are using !GridFTP server that is installed during the !BeStMan installation you will need  to enable,configure Gratia !GrdFTP transfer probe and perform the actions described in
 [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]]

---++ Enabling the Services
You can use the _vdt-control -list_ command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. 
You will need to enable the following services:
   * fetch-crl   
   * vdt-rotate-logs  
   * vdt-update-certs       
   * gsiftp           
   * gratia-gridftp-transfer  %ICON{warning}% In case you want to run Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe
   * gums-host-cron   %ICON{warning}% In case you want to run Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe and are using !GUMS for authorization
   * edg-mkgridmap     %ICON{warning}% In case you want to use gridmap-file for authorization 

You can execute _vdt-control -enable_ command and list all services you want to enable:
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
source setup.sh
vdt-control -enable fetch-crl vdt-rotate-logs vdt-update-certs gsiftp  
</pre> 

If you are using !GUMS or have gridmap-file and don't want to use automatically generated one, please, skip this section:
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION>;
source setup.sh
vdt-control -enable edg-mkgridmap
edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
</pre> 

---++ Services Startup/Shutdown 
You have to be root to start/stop each service. You have to start all the components in the 
following order (this is order is optional but seems logical): 
   1. Start !BeStMan  (!GridFtp and Gratia transfer probe). Login on !BeStMan node, then:
<pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control --on 
</pre>
   1. Stop !BeStMan (!GridFtp and Gratia transfer probe). Login on !BeStMan node, then: 
<pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control --off  
</pre> 

---++ Validation of Service Operation 
In order to verify that the system is functional you will need to have access to srm client commands, be able to create a proxy certificate (_grid-proxy-init_ or _voms_proxy_init_ command) and have access to your certificate and private key.

There are multiple ways of doing this.

---+++ Preparing to run srm-client command on the !BeStMan node
Running commands on the node you have just installed !BeStMan. 
   * Login on this node as "yourself'
   * Setup location of !BeStMan installation
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
</pre>
   * Make sure that you have access to your certificate and private key on that node, you will need it to create a proxy certificate. Execute grid-proxy-init:
<pre class="screen">
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</pre>
   * You will need to add the path to all the srm client scripts to your _PATH_ environment variable and create grid proxy certificate. In order to do so you will need to have your certificate 
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
export PATH=$PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/bin
</pre>
---+++ Preparing to run srm-client command from the different node

 Install client command on the node where you have your certificate and public key. The detailed instruction is provided in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][in that installation Guide]]. Then generate a proxy certificate by issuing _grid_proxy_init or _voms_proxy_init_:
<pre class="screen">
. &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</pre>

or

<pre class="screen">
. &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
voms-proxy-init -voms  &lt;voms_name&gt;
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</pre>
Where  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt is the directory where you installed the client.

---+++ Executing SRM-client commands 
After you manage to get proxy certificate and access to srm commands you may try to verify !BeStMan:

Execute srm-ping: 
<pre class="screen">
 srm-ping srm://&lt;BeStMan_host&gt;:&lt;secured_port_http&gt;/srm/v2/server 
 </pre>

Expected results: 
<pre class="screen">

#DebugInfo
---+++!!Debugging Procedure
If  system validation failed, you would probably need to check the each component in order 
to verify your installation. In order to do so you should check all of them in the following order: 
   * !GUMS (if in use) 
   * !GridFTP 
   * !BeStMan 

---++++ Verifying !GUMS 
Make sure that the service certificate you are specified for !BeStMan  configuration with  
--cert &lt;service_cert&gt; , --key  &lt;service_key&gt;  options and !GridFTP service certificate are 
accepted by !GUMS  (see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS Installation Documentation]])   
 
Get mapping _uid_ for your certificate and verify that this _uid_ exists on !BeStMan and !GridFTP node. 
 
---++++ Verifying !GridFTP 
Login on the node where you have installed have your certificate installed and  access to %CACHE%:wn_client or  %CACHE%:client.

You will need to get your _voms-proxy_ or _grid_proxy_ certificate see [[Validation of Service Operation][this section]] : 

Then test !GridFtp: 
<pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION 
. setup.sh 
echo “This is a test” >/tmp/test 
globus-url-copy -dbg file:///tmp/test gsiftp://&lt;GridFtp_host&gt;/tmp/test 
</pre>

Check the !GridFTP logs if you have encountered any errors.

---++++ Verifying !BeStMan-Gateway
Make sure that !BeStMan is running and there is no error in the log file (_$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log_)

<pre class="screen">
# ps auxww|grep $VDT_LOCATION/bestman|grep -v grep

I&#39;m not sure if it was supposed to point to the next section or to the similar section in the Bestman document.  If it just points to the following section, I would remove it.  Otherwise, the #anchor will need to be added to the Bestman document. (The ! is not needed for anchors.) | Main.JamesWeichel | 03 Mar 2010 - 20:00 |Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
