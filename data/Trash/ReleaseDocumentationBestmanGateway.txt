---+ Introduction
%INCLUDE{"Bestman" section="IntorductionGeneric"}% 
!BeStMan-Gateway supports subset of  SRM v2.2 on any existing file system without internal queuing or space management. This is a main difference between !BeStMan-Gateway and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman][BeStMan -fullmode]].

   $ Q. _Do you need to support static space tokens?_ : !BeStMan-Gateway supports pre-defined, static space tokens that could be included in configuration. It doesn't keep track of the contents in the space with the static space tokens, nor enforce allocations.  If you want to partition your storage space and have a “designated” space for some VOs or users, you can choose to use space tokens. You will have to provide the names and descriptions of the tokens as well as the size of the area.  

%INCLUDE{"Bestman" section="GetHelp"}%


---+ !BeStMan-Gateway Configuration

You will need to configure !BeStMan-Gateway first in order to enable it as a service. !BeStMan is recommended to run under non-root account.

The simplest configuration example is shown below. It utilizes all the default values including the default user (in this configuration !BeStMan runs as user ==daemon==) and the default path to certificate and key ( ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem==, ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem==) that should have the right set of permission and belong to user ==daemon==. See [[#Requirements][Requirements]] for details.

<pre class="rootscreen">
<code>%UCL_PROMPT_ROOT%$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y --enable-gateway</code>
</pre>

This command will install !BeStMan that will be 
   * running  by user ==daemon==,
   * using certificate  ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem== and certificate key ==/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem==
   * listening on secure port 10443 and public port 10080
   * utilizing  gridftp server running on the same host on 2811 port
   * using grid-mapfile for authorization
%ICON{warning}% This configuration command doesn't specify any storage area for !BeStMan , so the user will be able to write files only in the directories where she can access to (e.g ==/tmp== or under user's home directory if it exists on the node). 

If you don't want to try more complex configuration, you may skip the remaining of this and proceed to the [[#Sudoers_File_Modification][next sub-section]]  about the sudoers file.

The more complex installation example is shown below:

%STARTSECTION{"ComplexConfiguration"}%  

The example below shows how to configure !BeStMan in gateway-mode, enable !GUMS
and space token usage. If you would like to use pre-defined, static space tokens you need to provide a list of  space token names, description and size of space allocated for each token. Keep in mind that in gateway-mode, !BeStMan is not _managing_ the space.

%ICON{"warning"}% *The certificate file and key  should belong to the user* - Please, see [[#Requirements][Requirements]]. 
Please, see [[#Requirements][Requirements]] and [[#Verify_Service_Certificate_for_B][Verify Service Certificate]] section for more details

Where:


==public_port_http== public port (default port : 10080) <br/> 
==secured_port_http== private port (default port: 10443) <br/> 
==allowed_dir_list== list of directories, separated by semicolon, accessible to users <br/>
==blocked_dir_list== list of directories separated by semicolon, non-accessible to users (default are "/;/etc;/var") . One of the  --with-allowed-paths / --with-blocked-paths options should be used for storage access polity.<br/>
==GUMS hostname== the name of  !GUMS server, <br/> 
==GUMS port number== the port of !GUMS  server, <br/>   
token list format: _token_name[KEY:VALUE][token_size_in_GB]_ where:
   * KEY = desc, owner, retention, latency, path, usedBytesCommand. All KEY:VALUE pairs are optional
   * desc = in ATLAS experiment, _desc_ value needs to be the same as the space token name as exampled below.
   * retention available values = CUSTODIAL, OUTPUT, REPLICA. Normally, REPLICA and CUSTODIAL are used.
   * latency  available values = ONLINE, NEARLINE
   * usedBytesCommand = e.g. some custom script or "du -s -b". Its output shall have the available bytes as the first value
   * multiple token names are separated by semi-colon
For example:

"USATLASDATA1[desc:USATLASDATA1][owner:atlas][retention:REPLICA][latency:ONLINE][path:/project/usatlas/data][usedBytesCommand:/usr/bin/du -s -b][120]"



 ==GridFTP server list==  is a list !FQDN of your !GridFTP servers, separated by ; . e.g. 
“gsiftp://host1.domain.tld;gsiftp://host2.domain.tld” 
If not specified the local hostname will be used as a name of !GridFTP server.
<br/> 

If you want to use grid-mapfile for user authentication and authorization do not specify  the following options:
 
 --gums-host   %BR%
 --gums-port 
 
If you do not want to use pre-defined, static space tokens, do not specify the following 
options: 

--with-tokens-list 

If you are running your !BeStMan-Gateway on the node that doesn’t have an access to  your file system, you will have to modify the following attributes in ==$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc== configuration file: 
<pre class="rootscreen"> 
checkSizeWithFS=false 
checkSizeWithGsiftp=true 
</pre>
These options will allow file system access through !GridFTP. However, this requires full GSI delegation from the clients.

---+ Validation of Service Operation 

In order to verify that the system is functional, you will need to have access to srm client commands, be able to create a proxy certificate (_grid-proxy-init_ or _voms_proxy_init_ command) and have access to your certificate and private key.

There are multiple ways of doing this.

---++ Preparing to run srm-client command on the !BeStMan node

Running commands on the node you have just installed !BeStMan. 
   * Login on this node as "yourself'
   * Setup location of !BeStMan installation
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
</pre>

   * Make sure that you have access to your certificate and private key on that node. You will need it to create a proxy certificate. Execute grid-proxy-init:
<pre class="screen">
<code>
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</code>
</pre>
   * You will need to add the path to all the srm client commands to your _PATH_ environment variable. You will need to have your proxy certificate created before running SRM client commands.
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
export PATH=$PATH:$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/bin
</pre>
---++ Preparing to run srm-client command from the different node

Install OSG Client on the node where you have your certificate and key. Instruction are in the  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide][OSG Client Installation Guide]]. Then generate a proxy certificate by issuing _grid_proxy_init or _voms_proxy_init_:
<pre class="screen">
. &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
grid-proxy-init
Your identity: .....
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</pre>

or

<pre class="screen">
. &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
voms-proxy-init -voms  &lt;voms_name&gt;
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
</pre>
Where  _VDT_LOCATION_ is the directory where you installed the client.

---++ Executing SRM-client commands 

After you manage to get your personal proxy certificate created and access to srm client commands, you can verify !BeStMan server installation:

Execute srm-ping: 
<pre class="screen">
 srm-ping srm://&lt;BeStMan_host&gt;:&lt;secured_port_http&gt;/srm/v2/server 
 </pre>

Expected results: 
<pre class="screen">

If srm-ping is succesful, you can test srm copy. First, create a file 
_“test1”_ in _/tmp_ directory and execute: 
 
<pre class="screen">
srm-copy   file:////tmp/test1 
srm://&lt;BeStMan_host&gt;:&lt;secured_port_http &gt;/srm/v2/server\?SFN=&lt;FS_ROOT_DIR&gt;/test1 -spacetoken &lt;TOKEN_1_NAME>&gt; 
</pre>
 
You should get back something like that:

If you turned on Gratia !GridFTP transfer probes, you should be able to see the accounting information by accessing your Gratia collector. See details in  [[GratiaTransferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]].

---+ Troubleshooting
---++ File Locations

You could find log and configuration files for each of the module in the following location: 

| *Module Name* |  *Configuration files* | *Log files* | 
|!BeStMan | $VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc | $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log<br/>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/bestman.log | 
|!GridFTP |$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/vdt-run-gsiftp.sh.env| $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log<br/> $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log |

---++ Open Ports

The following ports are opened for the installed services
|*Module Name*|*Port Number*| *Protocol*|
|!BeStMan| 8080 (default 10080)| tcp|
||8443 (default 10443)|tcp|
|!GridFTP|2811|tcp|
||lowPort,maxPort if needed to control outbound globus connections|tcp|  
#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Procedure

If  system validation got failed, you would probably need to check the each component in order 
to verify your installation. In order to do so, you should check all of them in the following order: 
   * !GUMS (if in use) 
   * !GridFTP 
   * !BeStMan 

---+++ Verifying !GUMS 

Make sure that the service certificate you specified for !BeStMan  configuration with  
--cert &lt;service_cert&gt; , --key  &lt;service_key&gt;  options and !GridFTP service certificate are 
accepted by !GUMS  (see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS Installation Documentation]])   
 
Get mapping _uid_ for your certificate and verify that this _uid_ exists on !BeStMan and !GridFTP node. 
 
---+++ Verifying !GridFTP 

Login on the node where you have installed have your certificate installed and  access to %CACHE%:wn_client or  %CACHE%:client.

You will need to get your _voms-proxy_ or _grid_proxy_ certificate. See [[Validation of Service Operation][this section]] : 

Then test !GridFTP: 
<pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION 
. setup.sh 
echo “This is a test” > /tmp/test 
globus-url-copy -dbg file:////tmp/test gsiftp://&lt;GridFtp_host&gt;//tmp/test 
</pre>

Check the !GridFTP logs if you have encountered any errors.

---+++ Verifying !BeStMan-Gateway

Make sure that !BeStMan is running and there is no error in the log file (_$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/event.srm.log_)

<pre class="screen">
# ps auxww|grep $VDT_LOCATION/bestman|grep -v grep

</pre>

If !BeStMan is not running check information in that log file _$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/bestman/logs/bestman.log_.

|Under 'Create an installation directory', I see what was probably an errant search/replace. <verbatim>Create a directory, e.g. /opt/http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2-bestman.</verbatim>| Main.SarahWilliams | 31 Jul 2009 - 20:18|Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
|Under 'Download BeStMan-Gateway', the 'Pacman' link goes to the ITB092 rather than ReleaseDocumentation version of PacmanBestPractices| Main.SarahWilliams |31 Jul 2009 - 20:18|Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
|Under 'Support', the FAQ link is broken. | Main.SarahWilliams |31 Jul 2009 - 20:18|Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
| Style nit-picks: under 'Configuring BeStMan-gateway ', the allow/block paths options use =, the rest use a space. Also, there are extra spaces at the end of each of the configure command lines, so copy/paste does not work. | Main.SarahWilliams |31 Jul 2009 - 21:01|Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
| Under 'Downloading BeStMan-Gateway', the list of services I see at that step is different that what is in the doc. Especially, Bestman is missing. It doesn't appear until configure is run | Main.SarahWilliams | 31 Jul 2009 - 21:09 |Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
| Under 'System Validation', in the srm-copy command there is a stray .gov . | Main.SarahWilliams |31 Jul 2009 - 20:18|Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
| Under &#39;System Validation&#39;, the &#39;configure CA package updates. &#39; needs to be grouped with the &#39;Otherwise&#39; option above. | Main.RobSnihur | 12 Feb 2010 - 20:51 |Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
| Just before the heading &#34;BeStMan-Gateway Configuration&#34;, there is a broken link.  I&#39;m not sure if it was supposed to point to the next section or to the similar section in the Bestman document.  If it just points to the following section, I would remove it.  Otherwise, the #anchor will need to be added to the Bestman document. (The ! is not needed for anchors.) | Main.JamesWeichel | 03 Mar 2010 - 20:00 |Fixed - Main.TanyaLevshina|
