---++ About this Document
%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for system administrators and presents a reference to the syntax and structure of the ini configuration files used by various OSG configuration tools, most notably =osg-configure=.
%NOTE% The definition of the options in the ini configurations files is in [[IniOptions][ini options]].

---++ General Layout

The configuration file used by =osg-configure= is similar in format to the ini configuration file used by windows.  Long lines can be split up using continuations as specified in RFC 822.  A config file is separated into sections with each section starting with a section name in square brackets (e.g. =[Section 1]=) .  Lines that begin with a =;= or a =#= are treated as comments and ignored.  Options can be set using either =name : value= or =name=value= pairs.  Finally, variables and variable subsitutions are supported.

=osg-configure= now reads and uses all of the files in =/etc/osg/config.d= that have a ini suffix.  The files in this directory are ordered with a numeric prefix with higher numbers being applied later and thus having higher precedence (e.g. 00-foo.ini has a lower precedence than 99-local-site-settings.ini).  Configuration sections and options can be specified multiple times in different files. E.g. a section called [PBS] can be given in =20-pbs.ini= as well as =99-local-site-settings.ini=.

Each of the files are successively read and merged to create a final configuration that is then used to configure OSG software.  Options and settings in files read later take precedence to previous files.  This allows admins to create a file with settings that can be read last and which will be take precedence over the default settings in configuration files installed by various RPMs and which will not be overwritten if the osg-configure rpms are updated. 

---++ Variables and variable substitution
The osg-configure parser allows variables to be defined and used in the configuration file.  Any option set in a given section can be used as a variable in that section.  Note, this means that you will need to be careful when naming variables in order to avoid an infinite loop when resolving the variable substitution.  Assuming that you have set an option with the name =myoption= in the section, you can substitute the value of that option elsewhere in the section by referring to it as =%(myoption)s= .  Please note that the trailing =s= is required.  Also the variable substitution will only occur when setting an option, so option names can not have a variable substitution in them.
