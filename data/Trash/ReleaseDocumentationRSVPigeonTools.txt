---++ Introduction

The following document explains how to use and configure pigeon tools to monitor storage elements that support a VO.
Pigeon-tools is currently available via the VDT and will be available in the osg in 
%RED% *osg-version 1.2* %ENDCOLOR% (or higher).  This document is aimed towards system administrators or 
site administrators who wish to run pigeon tools using the RSV framework.

Pigeon-tools is based on [[MonitoringInformation/RSV][RSV]] and will use RSV and apache to display results of storage tests.

Further help can be obtained by emailing the OSG-storage mailing list.

---++ Requirements

   * You will need to have a [[ReleaseDocumentation/UserCESimpleTest#Authentication_using_a_Grid_Proxproxy][grid proxy]] certificate signed by your VO (virtual-organization).  This is needed to access grid services.  
   * You will need %LINK_PACMAN% installed in order to install the VDT packages.
   * You will need to create a location for the VDT.  If you already have an existing VDT installation, you can use that.  This location will be later referred to as ==$VDT_LOCATION==.
   * You will need to configure [[MonitoringInformation/RSV][RSV]] as part of the installation.  If you already use RSV, you can use that installation.  If you do not, instructions to configure the minimum RSV needed for pigeon is explained below under "RSV configuration".
   * Root access is generally needed to install RSV.  This procedure assumes that your VDT installation is done as root.  Installs as a non-privileged user may be possible, but it is likely that you will need to create some directories, ports, and permissions by hand.  Dealing with these complications is out of scope for this page and further help should be obtained from the OSG mailing lists.


---++ Pigeon Tools Installation Procedure

Pigeon tools is a package of the VDT and is installed on top of [[MonitoringInformation/RSV][RSV]].  If you already have VDT installed 
and you would like to install it in that location, perform these commands in ==$VDT_LOCATION== (after sourcing ==setup.sh==).

<pre class="rootscreen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION
pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:pigeon-tools
. setup.sh
</pre>

This step will also install [[MonitoringInformation/RSV][RSV]] as a dependency.  

If this is the first VDT package you have installed, you will need to install the certificates. 
For more information, see the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall][CA Certificate instructions]].

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="LocalInstallation" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="EnableCACertificates" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%
 *If you are you using a pre-installed VDT, you do not enable the certificates again.*

%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall" section="EnableCRL" INPUT_SCREEN="rootscreen"}%
 *If you are you using a pre-installed VDT, you do not enable the fetch-crl again.*


---++ RSV configuration

Edit ==$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini==.  *Note:* If you are running RSV/pigeon standalone, you will probably want to 
use the rsv.ini instead of configuring the full config.ini as follows:

<pre class="rootscreen">
cd osg/etc
cp rsv.ini config.ini
vi config.ini
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>

You will need to modify the following attributes:

<pre class="file">
; The rsv_user option gives the user that the RSV service should use.  It must  ; be a valid unix user account                                                  
rsv_user = UNIX_ACCT

; You must use a certificate with RSV.  Either you can use a service certificate
; or a user certificate.  Using a service certificate is highly recommended
; because it will be automatically renewed for you with each job that runs.
;
; To use a service certificate, set the following variables:
use_service_cert = True
rsv_cert_file = server_cert.pem
rsv_key_file = server_key.pem
rsv_proxy_out_file = where_proxy_will_go

; To use a user certificate, uncomment and set the following variables:
;use_service_cert = False
;proxy_file=/tmp/x509_proxy_file
</pre>

You will need to designate a user account for RSV.  You will also have to designate either a service cert/key pair OR a user generated proxy file.
If you use a proxy file, you will probably need a mechanism to automatically update it, as it will expire after some time.


---++ Pigeon configuration

Next, you will need to configure Pigeon.  

<pre class="rootscreen">
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_pigeon --rsvuser %RED%rsv_user%ENDCOLOR% --vo %RED%vo_name%ENDCOLOR% --server y
</pre>

*Note: If you re-run ==configure-osg==, you may need to re-run the above command to re-enable the pigeon-consumer (which outputs the pigeon results on to the HTML page).*

| *rsvuser* | daemon | The unix account that RSV and pigeon will run as. |
| *vo* |  Engage | The name of the VO that you will query. |
| *server* | y | Whether pigeon should be installed as a VDT service and run regularly as a cron job.  If you specify as "n", then you will need to run "vdt-control --enable pigeon-tools" later to enable the cron job, or you will need to run it manually as described below. |


If you are interested in modifying the configuration manually.  
You can find it in ==$VDT_LOCATION/pigeon-tools/etc/pigeon.ini==.  

<pre class="file">
vo=Engage
timeout=120
surl_metric=org.osg.srm.srmclient-ping
surl_metric=org.osg.srm.srmclient-put
surl_metric=org.osg.srm.srmclient-mv
surl_metric=org.osg.srm.srmclient-rm
surl_metric=org.osg.srm.srmclient-mkdir
surl_metric=org.osg.srm.srmclient-rmdir
turl_metric=org.osg.globus.gridftp-simple
</pre>

| *vo* | Engage | The name of the VO you would like to query.  Pigeon will find all storage elements that advertise support for this VO. |
| *timeout* | 120 | The number of seconds that pigeon will wait before exiting long-running commands and assume failure. |
| *surl_metric* | org.osg.srm.srmclient-ping | The name of an RSV metric that will run for each SRM surl found.  You can specify this argument multiple times as above. A list of metrics can be found at [[MonitoringInformation/RSVOwners][RSV Metrics]].|
| *turl_metric* | org.osg.globus.gridftp-simple | The name of an RSV metric that will run for each Grid FTP url found. You can specify this argument multiple times. A list of metrics can be found at [[MonitoringInformation/RSVOwners][RSV Metrics]]. |



---++ Running Pigeon

Pigeon can be run manually or as a cron/condor_cron script.  

Pigeon comes with a ==pigeon-tools== services.  This allows pigeon to be run nightly.  This will be enabled only if you set the server option above.  To turn on this cron job for pigeon to run nightly, execute the following command:
<pre class="rootscreen">
vdt-control --on pigeon-tools
</pre>

If you are ready to run pigeon right now, you can also run the tests manually.  This can be run as root or as the user specified above as the rsvuser.

<pre class="rootscreen">
$VDT_LOCATION/pigeon-tools/bin/pigeon
</pre>

Note: This will take a while to run.  It will query BDII and test each storage element returned.  This can take several hours.  

---++ Viewing Pigeon Results

You will need to turn on both the apache and osg-rsv services in order to see the results.  

To enable these services so that they will turn on by default:
<pre class="rootscreen">
vdt-control --enable apache
vdt-control --enable osg-rsv
</pre>

To turn them on right now:
<pre class="rootscreen">
vdt-control --on apache
vdt-control --on osg-rsv
</pre>


You will be able to see the results at https://hostname.com:8443/pigeon.  Note that results may take a few minutes (up to five minutes) to show up if this is the first time you are running pigeon.

Results are updated every five minutes.

You should see an output that looks similar to this:

     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/snapshot6.png" alt="Snapshot of an example pigeon output HTML" width='90%'  />    


---++ Debugging Information

Pigeon prints out information to stdout.  If this does not help, you may need to see the !RSV logs.
These can be found in ==$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/logs/probes==.  

There will be a output and error file for each host/probe combination, for instance: ==gw014k1.fnal.gov:8443__org.osg.srm.srmping.log==.

You can also look at the consumer logs (which are the processes that create the html pages and gratia records) at
==$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/logs/consumers==.

---+++ Common Problems

   * No html pages: Run ==condor_cron_q== and see if the html-consumer and pigeon-consumer are running.  If a long run-time shows up next to html-consumer, try running ==vdt-control --off== followed by ==vdt-control --on== to restart it.
   * No pigeon-consumer exists: re-run the ==configure_pigeon== commands.
   * Permission issues: ==$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/output== and its sub directories should be owned by the rsvuser.  If not, you may see permission problems in the logs.
   * Directories missing in osg-rsv: Verify config.ini entries and re-run ==configure-osg -c==.  Then, re-run ==configure_pigeon==.
