---++ Introduction
This page is about the installation of a simple Condor batch system, with a head node and worker nodes, that can be used for an OSG site, a Computing Element (CE), or a Tier 3. 
This is not about Trash.ReleaseDocumentationManagedFork and it is not intended as a general [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor guide]]; OSG is not providing support for installing cluster fabrics, Operating Systems and management software. This is also not about Condor-cron or Condor-G used in client installations. It is a simple installation and collection of examples targeting Tier 3s not familiar with cluster computing. If you have already a cluster with a local resource manager (PBS, LSF, Condor, SGE, ...) you do not need this. Condor has been chosen over other LRMs not because of any special features but because we have in house expertise and distribution packages available. (Note: Condor does come installed as part of the VDT, but this is only recommended for Trash.ReleaseDocumentationManagedFork jobs or for installing Condor clients and these are beyond the scope of these directions. For installing a Condor batch system, we do _not_ recommend using the version the VDT packaged version.)

For our purpose a cluster is a set of computers connected on a (local) network. The cluster is used to run jobs. One of the nodes, head node, has to be also on a _public_ network . _public_ means visible from the hosts used to submit jobs. The other nodes may be on either a public or private network and are referred to as Worker Nodes (WNs).

The software coordinating the jobs in a cluster is a Local Resource Manager, Condor for our purposes. In Condor the configuration and the components running on the head node are different form those running on worker nodes.

The installation below will take care of both.

---++ Preparing the installation
A cluster of machines is assumed
   * one machine available also on the public network is selected as head node
   * other machines are worker nodes

---++ Installation
Condor installation and configuration varies greatly depending on your cluster and network.
The instructions linked below are from the [[Trash/Tier3.ModulesIntro#Phase_2_Quick_guide_for_setting][Tier 3 Condor documentation]]. The documents are mostly self contained but you can read more of the  [[Trash/Tier3.WebHome][Tier 3 documentation]] if you want clarification on the context (names, network topology, ...).

Condor can be installed in different ways.

We recommend to install Condor using the RPM packages provided by the Condor team:
   * Trash/Tier3.CondorRPMInstall - Condor is installed on each node using the RPM packages of Condor
      * no contention for shared files
      * only option if no shared file system
      * cons: some more work to add nodes 
      * cons: updates need to be installed on all nodes 
Alternatively you may install Condor using the TAR file distribution on a shared file system. This may become necessary if you have a platform not supported by the current RPMs or if you need to have multiple version of Condor installed and selectable at the same time: 
   * Trash/Tier3.CondorSharedInstall - an easy way to add Condor to small clusters using a shared file system 
      * supports more platforms (not only RHEL derived ones)
      * allows the concurrent suport of multiple versions
      * it is easy to add new nodes
      * configuration changes and updates are also very quick
      * cons: shared installation may slow down several nodes using it

The Trash/Tier3.CondorTest page shows how to check the status of the Condor installation and how to submit some simple job.
