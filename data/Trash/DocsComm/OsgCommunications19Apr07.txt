   * Allhands broch in DocDB, was that a Todo?   Done by MT

   * webex -- I've registered, done nothing else -- we'll get Margaret V to get us started.
   * from ideas at conference -- how do we do podcasts?  I'm so out of it! We'll need to talk to Ruth about these things. Can we use VMS? Need to pay for tapes, maybe other expenses. MT says keep it in mind, and as things come up, move on it.  Schedule meeting with VMS about this.
