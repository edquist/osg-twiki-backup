Jen's questions this week:  Ruth's twiki calendar of events and how it relates to Mtgs and Events page.  Penelope's criticism of navigation on that page; is this an issue to deal with?  Allhands broch in DocDB, was that a Todo?  CI Days listed on our page(s) ?  twiki privacy - Forrest had one suggestion seemed worth trying, refer to his mail if we want. Also, upcoming events still not much there, what am I missing.
