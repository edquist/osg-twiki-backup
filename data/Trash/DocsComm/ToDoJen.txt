- OSG DocDB changes/review of topics
- Document procedures on twiki -- update RH, create iSGTW contributions, update NewsSearch (posting news items is in BP)
- News search daily.
- News search ongoing. I will do this rather than rotate.

- Edit some test OSG pages to get over learning curve on CMS, refer to Kevin's explanations. It still doesn't work well for me (certificate error, waiting on Kevin's response).

- Continue to use plone, twiki and figure how to manage own work and collaborate efficiently.
