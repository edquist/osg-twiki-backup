Jen's To Do List for OSG Communications

CURRENTLY WORKING ON

- GADU RH: Interview M. Romine 1/24, write draft 2 same day, get Mark with her for image if necessary. DEADLINE = to KY 2/1.

- News search this week. Nothing found so far, just iSGTW Purdue/UCSD article.
d11 1
- Edit OSG pages for news -- learning curve on CMS, seek more instructive documentation.
- Document procedures on twiki -- update RH, create iSGTW contributions, update NewsSearch (posting news items is in BP)
- Getting this list up here! but also make it workable for me and all... continue to think about this.
- News search ongoing. I will do this rather than rotate.
- Meet with KY and Danielle (tentative for 1/22 or 23)
- Edit some test OSG pages to get over learning curve on CMS, refer to Kevin's explanations. It still doesn't work well for me (certificate error, waiting on Kevin's response).
NEAR FUTURE and/or ONGOING
- Continue to use plone, twiki and figure how to manage own work and collaborate efficiently.
- OSG DocDB changes/review of topics
d34 1
d18 1
- Daily quick review of edits to news box and other pages
*NEAR FUTURE and/or ONGOING*
- Obtain and read Zinsser book at least.
- Look for ownership on other tasks so it's not all ad hoc.
- Continue to look for ownership on other tasks so it's not all ad hoc. Here are some ideas:  List maintenance... (and with the ownership some way to track and notify that when a request comes to a group, everyone knows I will take that)
Next news search week of 5 FEB.
- News search daily
