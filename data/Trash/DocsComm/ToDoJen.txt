Jen's To Do List for OSG Communications

*CURRENTLY WORKING ON*

- GADU RH: Deal with last edits.  Crop pictures (Photoshop Elements) and post, then review (make sure RP (others?) OK w/ purple). Goes on osg site Tues 6 Feb, in iSGTW 7 Feb.

- Play with screen shots so when it comes up next it's no delay.

- OSG DocDB changes/review of topics
- Document procedures on twiki -- update RH, create iSGTW contributions, update NewsSearch (posting news items is in BP)
- News search daily.

- I still only use plone as an entryway to twikis. Will attempt to do stuff in plone but am quite maxed out on new tools and processes at the moment.

- Daily quick review of edits to news box and other pages
*NEAR FUTURE and/or ONGOING*
- Obtain and read Zinsser book at least.

- Continue to look for ownership on other tasks so it's not all ad hoc. Here are some ideas:  List maintenance... (and with the ownership some way to track and notify that when a request comes to a group, everyone knows I will take that)
- News search daily
