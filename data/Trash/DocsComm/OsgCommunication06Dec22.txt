---++OSG Newsletter
   MT made list of [[NewsletterPublicationSteps][Publication Steps]] to help remember which pages need updating.

---++ Other OSG News Items 

JN: news search, refreshing news. who owns that task  -- nobody's doing it now, it's hanging. MT looks at GridToday.

 Currently RP is saying what to post.  JN could help out with this. 

OSG-related news
google news alert and gridtoday
If osg puts press release, and gets reprinted -- KY tends not to put the reprints in "in the news" 

Do we want to put isgtw articles, not there now.

last sgtw ref is July 26, there have been osg articles since.  Don't put RHs again, redundant

change media contact to my name. 
KY back in contact on the 8th.
