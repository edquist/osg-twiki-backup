	* Ruth's comments available...

---++ Paul Avery's website Comments

	* All the URLs are huge - I want to add Search Engine Friendly URLs, but I haven't been able to get it to work at IU yet, and I'm not sure if the machine admins would make the changes at Fermi
	* the site feels slow - not sure what to do here
	* difficult to navigate 
	* have to have patience to find a map showing the OSG Grid sites, something that should be seen in miniature even on the front page.

  
---++ Putting documentation into the KB

---++ Getting another IU person access to fermi in case of emergency

	* We think this should be John Rosheck because he is the current machine admin for the GOC.  We'll work on this next meeting.
