	* Ruth's comments available...

---++ Paul Avery's website Comments

	* All the URLs are huge - I want to add Search Engine Friendly URLs, but I haven't been able to get it to work at IU yet, and I'm not sure if the machine admins would make the changes at Fermi
	* the site feels slow - not sure what to do here
	* difficult to navigate 
	* have to have patience to find a map showing the OSG Grid sites, something that should be seen in miniature even on the front page. - will be putting a gridcat image on the main page to look at next week

  
---++ Putting documentation into the KB

	* Baseline documentation needs to go in in the next day or two.

---++ Getting another IU person access to fermi in case of emergency

	* We think this should be John Rosheck because he is the current machine admin for the GOC.  We'll work on this next meeting.

---++ Meetings & Events

---++ Other Topics

	* Finding a unified way to make documentation happen.  Twiki only?  Twiki to something else, but automated?  The GOC will discuss.
