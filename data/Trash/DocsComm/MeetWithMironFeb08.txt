---+ Meet w Miron to discuss vision, communications etc. 2/21/08

---++ general
PR is because we need it, he's cynical about it

Getting word out -- who cares?
   1. bring people in (what does that mean?)  Replace "join" with "participate".
   1. use OSG resources in effective way -- really enhance advancement of research

Do we understand what's needed to "bring them in"?

OSG needs to think more about how we operate (blueprint activity)

Council: users, resources, sw providers  -- want to "bring in" all three?
How do we bring in new s/w?  Miron talks to people, thinks that if he finds something and brings it in, it will be useful, members will figure out how to use it effectively

have we articulated the path: edu -> engage -> OSG VO -> independent VO

---++ Call to Oakridge
I listened in on a call to a prospective app user at Oakridge.  Here's roughly the conversation track Miron followed...

Let's start with an understanding.  You use CHARMM, for what applications? (let him talk about the science)  What add-ons?
Oakridge says he wants to go to a bigger system; they need to analyze 1M atoms in 2ns for neutron scattering
Uses same tool for biofuels and protein/biomolecular complexes (develop method to bue
