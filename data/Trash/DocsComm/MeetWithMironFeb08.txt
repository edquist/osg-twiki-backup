---+ Meet w Miron to discuss vision, communications etc. 2/21/08
%TOC%
---++ Summary

Miron and I discussed the vision of OSG; Important things:
   * welcoming
   * low threshold startup, or help with startup (e.g. engagement)
   * easy for sites to accommodate new VOs, new users 
   * reaching out to different sciences 
   * growth (VOs, resources and software)

less important
   * metrics -- are they just to make us feel good? to make funding agencies feel good?
   * the important metric that he sees: how much effort is required by end use to use OSG resources effectively
   * catering to funding agencies when designing website

OSG still has a lot to figure out:
   * how do we operate
   * what does it mean to join?  Do people/VOs "join" or just participate?
   * how to bring in more people (how to grow)
   * how to make sure researchers use the resources in an effective, efficient way

Important things for website
   * his impression was overall negative
   * audience-focus: logical, consistent navigation keeping user-type in mind
   * who cares if our website looks like we're dynamic
   * articulate path: edu to engage to OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to independent VO
   * echoed Chris G's call for a "I can't find what I want" button
   * twiki -- all WebHome pages should have intro paragraph: short and sweet (didn't look a lot at twiki)

2/25/07  -- starting TestsForNav page

Thinks my time is better spent in documentation than communications; i.e. that it's a more important activity.

---++ Miron
---+++ general
PR is because we need it, he's cynical about it

Getting word out -- who cares?
   1. bring people in (what does that mean?)  Replace "join" with "participate".
   1. use OSG resources in effective way -- really enhance advancement of research

   * Do we understand what's needed to "bring them in"?  What does it mean to join?
   * OSG needs to think more about how we operate (blueprint activity)
   * He wants to change the way people think about computing -- can they simplify by breaking job into many simpler pieces?

   * Council: users, resources, sw providers  -- want to "bring in" all three?
   * what to do with them once they're in?
   * do we need "doc for dummies" and "doc for experts"?
   * How do we bring in new s/w?  Miron talks to people, thinks that if he finds something and brings it in, it will be useful, members will figure out how to use it effectively
   * have we articulated the path: edu -> engage -> OSG VO -> independent VO?
   * metrics -- who are they for; what meaning is there (he's not sold)

---+++ Call to Oakridge
I listened in on a call to a prospective app user at Oakridge.  Here's roughly the conversation track Miron followed...

   * Let's start with an understanding.  You use CHARMM (and NAMD), for what applications? (let him talk about the science)  What add-ons?
   * Oakridge says he wants to go to a bigger system; they need to analyze 1M atoms in 2ns for neutron scattering
   * Uses same tool for biofuels and protein/biomolecular complexes (develop method w neutron scattering to later use with biofuels)
   * looking for 300k hrs/yr; to run "many" simult simulations (Miron asked how many; ans was 2-3! "Many" is relative)
   * Miron asks in essence, can you think differently about your jobs; can you break them down into many smaller jobs 
   * efficiency is both queue time and execution time; for large jobs needing big resources, you'll have to wait longer (balance accessibility with size of resource)
   * M asks: can you run w less than 1M atoms in sim?
      * can you run on 512?  256?  128?  well, not sure, concerned with memory problems
      * think about different way of computing; redistributing work over different kinds/sizes of jobs
      * opportunistic resources more likely to be smaller; might get faster results this way (priorities, availability etc)
      * tell me what you CAN run on; remember OSG doesn't own resources or HW
   * gets him to think about it differently then boom -- oh, I see where we can help!
---+++ Vision
Miron's

   * much like Condor. High throughput computing (read his Condor chapter in the grid bible)
   * democratic, local autonomy
   * easy to implement changes in local site policies (no software updates, just a tweak in a config file)
   * 

---+++Website
He hadn't reviewed previously

   * Bottom line: looks like patchwork, designed by committee; not one vision. Should be one person responsible.
   * font too small (but after comparing with other sites, it's comparable)
   * home page needs text on "what is OSG"
   * mission statement isn't a mission statement
   * usage stats not very important
   * who cares about RHs
   * are there tools to measure navigation
   * grey bars not clickable -- BAD  (likes EGEE's drop down structure; knows we don't have the money they do)
   * calendar terrible -- can't see what's scheduled easily
   * Look at it from audience perspective.  Do use cases.  Start with one: security
   * Be positive, e.g., join OSG mentions too many regulations, etc, makes it "scary"
   * osg-contact should be 'first contact' -- continuous monitoring, rotate betw eot and engagement maybe
      * (Alain) at bottom of page "contact" should go to the contacts page, not osg-webmaster, and in turn, osg-webmaster should be listed on contacts page

   * can't find FAQ, it's too deep; suggests an index and a search that can enable people to answer their Q's.
      * not sure if he thinks it's answering the right questions
   * add a "can't find what you're looking for?" feature!!!
   * what's first link under osg@work -- not "what we do"?
   * broken link to goc on model of operation (also on goc page itself -- to a previous version of goc page?)
   * add a little text on index pages; doesn't like just links
   * see EGEE's "how to join"; it's better, easier and more welcoming
   * Glossary (and other things that take you out of website) should open in separate window
   * he liked old monitoring page (irony of ironies!)
      * good thing: the links open to new pages  (I think this is good when it takes you out of the main site)

   * think "what does it do for you"; think operationally
   * create design by user type to follow navigation down whole tree

   * GOC pages
      * Alain doesn't see (important stuff) at top -- as though it's just a heading. Feels like "this is wrong place for support!"
      * no simple intro to what you're there for
      * needs restructuring and better melding with osg site
      * why doesn't goc use same CMS as OSG does -- it's "similar but different" and thus confusing
      * "recent presentations" don't belong on main goc page
      * 
Action item for me: %BR%
Start with one topic: security. Follow it down from top to bottom with all audiences in mind.  Some issues w security:
   * incident reporting should be top level, easy to find, easy to shoot off message
   *  security vs abuse maillists -- which to use, then also email goc?  too much verbiage and unclear
   * is incident response plan protected? say so
---+++ ci days page
   * tail wags dog; don't pander to the funding agencies; what does it DO for you
   * doesn't like logos twice
   * doesn't like logos on all pages
   * smaller calendar (fills whole page)

But bottom line: if they don't need us; let them go ahead.  He sees CI days as small meetings, just discussions of type he had with Oakridge person; doesn't need website.  Maybe Sebastien can pull it over to the right model...

---++ Alain
   * the menu popup structure isn't visually obvious or logical
   * what to call twiki slash "collaborative workspace" slash "osg at work" 
   * can we rename deployment web to management?
   * doesn't like the redirect pages; likes to see the url to see where it's taking him
   * "about us" -> organization; he didn't expect to find about OSG members there (osg members should be first level link)
   * ask Kyle about VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo twiki page connect to GOC -- is it updated auto?
   * Alain and co. are watching daily gratia reports (not sure what this had to do with)
   * "about osg members -- need one for sites -- links on "resources" page; can't get to list of sites
   * calendar: when is the next meeting? can't tell. Hates indico calendar view cause has to move cursor.  
      * can we get rid of numbers at end of entry? (0) is misleading

Documentation:
   * doesn't like idea of "installation workbook", for release-spec doc likes "installation instructions" or "instal... guides"
   * likes my test page better than current 
   * archived versions need better linkage
   * "all install guides" implies archived versions too
   * where to put version number on doc home page... not for whole page, just for release doc

---++ Greg Thain
    * doesn't like term "doc hub" -- "what ISN'T a doc hub?"
    * why add word "technical", everything is technical
    * "information and help" -- what ISN'T information?
    * asked: what sites can I run on?  Don't know to look at VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS.  Couldn't find.
    * website is better than before; likes link-rich pages
    * avoid pages where there's a break and stuff below (no example cited)
    * use words that indicate what's behind link. E.g., monitoring bad because it says how you got something, not what info was monitored
    * doesn't like heading "osg at work"  sounds like success stories
3 user types:
   * admin, end user, funding agencies

   * articulate "principles of OSG" in website (blueprint sec 3)
   * read Edward Tufte (Yale) about website design
   * replace "osg at work" w sth like "members and staff"
   * make separation for users vs admins clearer on home page
   * can we do log file analysis to get some usability metrics (Google analytics)
   * get 2-3 people to look for 3 things in 10 min; see how well site works
   * how do other interdisciplinary fields organize info?

   * doesn't read newsletter. Do we need RSS feed instead?  
   * Is newsletter more for funding agencies or for consortium members?
   * is there anything in newsletter that's not in the website?  (yes -- but does it need to be that way?)
