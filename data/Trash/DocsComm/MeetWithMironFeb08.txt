---+ Meet w Miron to discuss vision, communications etc. 2/21/08

---++ general
PR is because we need it, he's cynical about it

Getting word out -- who cares?
   1. bring people in (what does that mean?)  Replace "join" with "participate".
   1. use OSG resources in effective way -- really enhance advancement of research

Do we understand what's needed to "bring them in"?  What does it mean to join?

OSG needs to think more about how we operate (blueprint activity)

   * Council: users, resources, sw providers  -- want to "bring in" all three?
   * what to do with them once they're in?
   * do we need "doc for dummies" and "doc for experts"?
   * How do we bring in new s/w?  Miron talks to people, thinks that if he finds something and brings it in, it will be useful, members will figure out how to use it effectively
   * have we articulated the path: edu -> engage -> OSG VO -> independent VO?
   * metrics -- who are they for; what meaning is there (he's not sold)

---++ Call to Oakridge
I listened in on a call to a prospective app user at Oakridge.  Here's roughly the conversation track Miron followed...

   * Let's start with an understanding.  You use CHARMM (and NAMD), for what applications? (let him talk about the science)  What add-ons?
   * Oakridge says he wants to go to a bigger system; they need to analyze 1M atoms in 2ns for neutron scattering
   * Uses same tool for biofuels and protein/biomolecular complexes (develop method w neutron scattering to later use with biofuels)
   * looking for 300k hrs/yr; to run "many" simult simulations (Miron asked how many; ans was 2-3! "Many" is relative)
   * Miron asks in essence, can you think differently about your jobs; can you break them down into many smaller jobs 
   * efficiency is both queue time and execution time; for large jobs needing big resources, you'll have to wait longer (balance accessibility with size of resource)
   * M asks: can you run w less than 1M atoms in sim?
      * can you run on 512?  256?  128?  well, not sure, concerned with memory problems
      * think about different way of computing; redistributing work over different kinds/sizes of jobs
      * opportunistic resources more likely to be smaller; might get faster results this way (priorities, availability etc)
      * tell me what you CAN run on; remember OSG doesn't own resources or HW
   * gets him to think about it differently then boom -- oh, I see where we can help!
---++ Vision
Miron's

   * much like Condor. High throughput computing (read his Condor chapter in the grid bible)
   * democratic, local autonomy
   * easy to implement changes in local site policies (no software updates, just a tweak in a config file)
   * 

---++Website
He hadn't reviewed previously

   * Bottom line: looks like patchwork, designed by committee; not one vision. Should be one person responsible.
   * 
   * Look at it from audience perspective.  Do use cases.  Start with one: security
   * Be positive, e.g., join OSG mentions too many regulations, etc, makes it "scary"
   * osg-contact should be 'first contact' -- continuous monitoring, rotate betw eot and engagement maybe
      * 
      * (Alain) at bottom of page "contact" should go to the contacts page, not osg-webmaster, and in turn, osg-webmaster should be listed on contacts page

   * can't find FAQ, it's too deep; wants it indexed and a search that can enable people to answer their Q's.
      * not sure if he thinks it's answering the right questions
   * add a "can't find what you're looking for?" feature!!!
   * what's first link under osg@work -- not "what we do"?
   * broken link to goc on model of operation (also on goc page itself -- to a previous version of goc page?)
   * add a little text on index pages; doesn't like just links
   * see EGEE's "how to join"; it's better, easier and more welcoming
   * he liked old monitoring page (irony of ironies!)
      * good thing: the links open to new pages  (I think this is good when it takes you out of the main site)

   * think "what does it do for you"; think operationally
   * create design by user type to follow navigation down whole tree

   * GOC pages
      * Alain doesn't see (important stuff) at top -- as though it's just a heading. Feels like "this is wrong place for support!"
      * no simple intro to what you're there for
      * needs restructuring and better melding with osg site
      * why doesn't goc use same CMS as OSG does -- it's "similar but different" and thus confusing
      * "recent presentations" don't belong on main goc page
      * 
Action item for me: %BR%
Start with one topic: security. Follow it down from top to bottom with all audiences in mind.  Some issues w security:
   * incident reporting should be top level, easy to find, easy to shoot off message
   *  security vs abuse maillists -- which to use, then also email goc?  too much verbiage and unclear
   * is incident response plan protected? say so
---+++ ci days page
   * tail wags dog; don't pander to the funding agencies; what does it DO for you
   * doesn't like logos twice
   * doesn't like logos on all pages
   * smaller calendar (fills whole page)

But bottom line: if they don't need us; let them go ahead.  He sees CI days as small meetings, just discussions of type he had with Oakridge person; doesn't need website.  Maybe Sebastien can pull it over to the right model...

---++ Alain
   * the menu popup structure isn't visually obvious or logical
   * what to call twiki slash "collaborative workspace" slash "osg at work" 
   * can we rename deployment web to management?
   * doesn't like the redirect pages; likes to see the url to see where it's taking him
   * "about us" -> organization; he didn't expect to find about OSG members there (osg members should be first level link)
   * ask Kyle about VO twiki page connect to GOC -- is it updated auto?
   * Alain and co. are watching daily gratia reports (not sure what this had to do with)
   * "about osg members -- need one for sites -- links on "resources" page; can't get to list of sites
   * calendar: when is the next meeting? can't tell. Hates indico calendar view cause has to move cursor.  
      * can we get rid of numbers at end of entry? (0) is misleading

Documentation:
   * doesn't like idea of "installation workbook", for release-spec doc likes "installation instructions" or "instal... guides"
   * likes my test page better than current 
   * archived versions need better linkage
   * "all install guides" implies archived versions too
   * where to put version number on doc home page... not for whole page, just for release doc

---++ Greg Thain
    * doesn't like term "doc hub" -- "what ISN'T a doc hub?"
    * why add word "technical", everything is technical
    * "information and help" -- what ISN'T information?
    * asked: what sites can I run on?  Don't know to look at VORS.  Couldn't find.
    * website is better than before; likes link-rich pages
    * avoid pages where there's a break and stuff below (no example cited)
    * use words that indicate what's behind link. E.g., monitoring bad because it says how you got something, not what info was monitored
    * doesn't like heading "osg at work"  sounds like success stories
3 user types:
   * admin, end user, funding agencies

   * articulate "principles of OSG" in website (blueprint sec 3)
   * read Edward Tufte (Yale) about website design
   * replace "osg at work" w sth like "members and staff"
   * make separation for users vs admins clearer on home page
   * can we do log file analysis to get some usability metrics (Google analytics)
   * get 2-3 people to look for 3 things in 10 min; see how well site works
   * how do other interdisciplinary fields organize info?

   * doesn't read newsletter. Do we need RSS feed instead?  
   * Is newsletter more for funding agencies or for consortium members?
   * is there anything in newsletter that's not in the website?  (yes -- but does it need to be that way?)

communications person: Perry Kiewoitz or Melody Bakken (head admin); K will send email when knows for sure
