---++ Notes - OSG Grid Operations and Support page
Jen Nahn 1/23/07

"Support Centers"
This is awkward.  Suggested rewording:

these are the organizations registered as part of OSG Operations. Each support center, in its role in OSG distributed operations, helps the resource administrators within an identified set of VOs.



The Operations Model opens a Word document. Is this intentional, or should someone make a PDF of the file?


The Support Centers Technical Group and Open a Trouble Ticket links open in the same window, unlike all the other links which open a new window.


"Please choose the type of support..."

This sentence doesn't make sense to me. Does this mean the menu on the left of this page, or once you get to the support centers technical group page? It seems like if it's referring to the SCTG, then it should be part of that same paragraph, and otherwise maybe it belongs below the line, then that whole section is generally where to look for help.


---++ OSG Website Review Getting Started page

22 January 2007 - Jen Nahn (NOTE MT has seen/done these, and AH is verifying the content w/ RP)

"Join a Virtual Organization"
QUESTION: The paragraph says OSG is thinking about forming its own VO.  Yet OSG is listed on the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo page (I take this as if it already were a VO.  It seems it should be removed from the list.  Or, if this has been formed, then the content of the "Join a VO" paragraph should be updated.


"Join a Virtual Organization"

VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Formation Process:

http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000059#formvo

Something's up with #formvo  -- It is linked 2 places on the page and doesn't work in either.


"Contribution is required" TANSTAAFL 
I didn't immediately recognize the acronym. Probably I am really out of it, but it would be fun to list it in the glossary, I think - link to the wikipedia definition?  


"I want to Connect"

First paragraph:  The current release (0.2 -- SHOULD BE 0.6.0)    

is defined in the Deployment document.

Is the Deployment document an actual document?  IF so we should refer to it by name and link to it. (I searched User and Release documentation and didn't find an obvious match, maybe this goes without saying to anyone who would use this page?)

Is this it:

http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/0000/000028/006/OSG-Deployment-Activity-v094.pdf

"Your Responsibilities:"

...links below to the current standard services... and general wording about standard services.  This confuses me, again maybe it's just me.  I'm not clear where the reference information is -- I looked under Software and under Grid Operations and Support.  Do we need to reword this to use terms that match better? Or if it's just me, then this section probably reads fine.
