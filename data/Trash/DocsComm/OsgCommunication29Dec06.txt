---++ Planning
Go over Anne's summary (on Communications page)


Go over MT's publication steps

News search, RSS , Google alert

Meet next week with Lisa -- also need to meet with Ruth
plone vs twiki -- what info in each, ...  use plone as interface to twiki? as organizer
meet with Mari to go over best practices, and admin editing role (Penelope)

Question about pages that don't get updated by expert -- how to escalate?

OSg news: can we have preview always at same URL?  Does it have to have month/yr in it?

Gizmo for cheap calling?

Question about organizing twiki, work organized both in twiki and plone?
