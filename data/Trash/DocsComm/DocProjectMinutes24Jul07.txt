---++ Things that have come up

   * Users meeting this Thurs/Fri: for doc, what do we need to communicate?
      * Some details/thoughts about user meeting in [[DocProjectMinutes10Jul07]]
      * One thing: how to encourage VOs to provide their own end-user doc. How much do we need to help them?
      * Chris -- comments on my presentation? (I didn't send draft to whole group; should I?)
      * Shaowen -- progress on consolidating troubleshooting doc?
      * Anne -- I've worked on [[Documentation/WebHome]] and some attached pages

      * Also see [[DocsComm/PlanningForEotDocEffort]]
      * Prep: need to work through spreadsheets with Rob G and maybe Rob Q.  When to do? (I'm updating still this week)
      * Siddhartha (new) from UFL will go through [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]]. 
      * He will be creating sysadmin tutorial materials.  We want these tutorials to overlap with actual sysadmin doc as much as possible.  Planning for this is one important goal for this meeting.

   * RWG:  integration "small group" to look at release doc.  Ideas, status, etc.?
---++ Last time
   * CG to KG: status on sysadmin; waiting to bring up deve area on twiki  Status: waiting (not urgent)
   * AH emailed Gabriele on VOServices. Email exchange ongoing -- I'm asking for structured info to make my life easier!

---++ Tim S
   * Tim to look into consolidating all this authorization info.  Status?
   * Need to figure out how to coordinate that doc for next release.

---++ Alina
   * Will try new "streamlined" guide when I tell her it's ready. (as of Mon 7/23 not ready)
   * Education main page [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Education_and_Training]] - Alina, did/could you go through with Mike W?

---++ Craig
   * %BLUE%Anne put this on hold -- lower priority than sysadmin tutorial doc. %ENDCOLOR% Thinks cert doc progress in 3-5 weeks (Alain R says: "updated its CA certificate distribution to reflect the contents of the IGTF 1.14 distribution." AH has email with ref URLS, but doesn't know significance of this. Will need follow-up please.)
   * Siddhartha (new hire) will come to Fermilab for sysadmin meeting end of July, and stay through Th Aug 2 to discuss doc. 

---++ Forrest (and Chris)

   * Documentation.InstallingOsgClient is the _extended_ version that I created... It will be moved into ITB_0_7. Someone needs to decide if it should replace the version in ReleaseDocumentation. %BLUE%This needs to be part of the discussion for RWG "small group" for 080 doc%ENDCOLOR%
   * app porting page: would be nice to have ready by users meeting, but no time.  FC points to red books for now. Where is this page? (link to from here, please)

 


---++ Anne
   * Ruth's email of 6/28 about VO (in regular website, not twiki) -- AH to address
   * [[Integration/ITB_0_5/LocalStorageConfiguration]] may need some work  -- %RED%volunteer?%ENDCOLOR% Maybe Forrest when hours come in.

   * We need to look at release doc table, figure out how to organize and order it (AH to follow up with RWG)
   * FAQ issues -- Eileen Berman reviewed; I'd like Forrest to take her comments and update the pages.

CE install guide
   * Need to finish 2nd round of install with JW's changes; then to hand over to Siddhartha. He should start soon, though, whether I'm done or not.
   * Need to finish 2nd round of install with JW's changes; then to hand over to Siddhartha. He can start any time though, whether I'm done or not.

From Forrest -- to bring up in talks with RWG and docs meeting:
   * "meta question being avoided here (Tim's Gums issue): why couldn't he accomplish this using the interface provided by the software? There may be a design or integration shortcoming that would eliminate the need for documentation."  Discussion?  Bring it up in integration meeting?
   * "our interface design is very poorly designed. We should move to 4.1 first since it changes some of the underlying technology. But the twiki interface is not serving anyone. Some of that is structural: having every Activity have their own web was a weird design choice that has turned out to be detrimental for the users."  Discussion?
d75 4
---++ Old Links in twiki (page reviews)
   * clean up all old links in twiki -- we should each take a few pages each time.  
      * see previous minutes for what's done
For this week (I didn't have time to plan for this)
 
---++ Action items DONE:
   * AH to go over FAQ with EBerman 
   * AH to bring up to RP & co that doc requires more effort 
   * AH to put together users meeting presentation (include "expectation of simplicity" issue)
   * AH to follow up with Craig about new hire 
   * AH to contact Edu group;  (and we conferred with Chander about WBS for yr 2)
   * Expert review of GridUsersGuide to answer AH's red questions  -- Nicolai Kouropatkin (DSS and DES) (AH sent email 7/23)
   * AH to put together users meeting presentation (include expectation of simplicity issue)
   * AH to follow up with Craig about new hire; no representation at today's meeting
   * AH to contact Edu group; no representation at today's meeting

---++ New action items
   * JWeigand says I should mention gratia probes in my ce install guide.  What sort of info does installer need to know besides "globus-condor-setup includes the probes"? %BR%
CG 10july: note after the install check x config file to be sure it says right thing.  common mech: multiple batch systems on ce. then need to run config command by hand.  CG to provide gratia config info. %BLUE% Not done; AH would like to hand this over to Siddhartha%ENDCOLOR%

   * Integration/ITB_0_5/LocalStorageConfiguration -- could use some work -- volunteer?

d83 1
---++ Other Action items from past meetings
  * AH to think about process for review and maintenance %BLUE%not done (can't seem to get to it!)%ENDCOLOR% 
   * Forrest's certif installation in installing osg client -- %BLUE%Forrest, please make sure Craig and new hire are aware of this%ENDCOLOR%

   * Need expert review of GridUsersGuide to answer AH's red questions  --- %BLUE% Did we pick somebody to do this?%ENDCOLOR% -- ask Nicolai Kouropatkin (prod for SDSS and DES)
   * review pages as listed above
   * AH to check CESiteAdminGuide vs ce install guide (then ask Horst to review)
   * AH to finish 2nd round of "streamlined" ce install guide
   * AH to do website VO changes per Ruth.
   * AH to ask Steve Timm: (from CG): there is need for a cut-down client for someone who wants to submit jobs and no more.  If there's way to do it, say from your laptop, it's not written down.  Way to config condor to shuffle off to submit node?
   * GGarz was asked to organize vo services info (by email, not in meeting)
   * EFC: Once he has OSG hours again: PortingYourApplication, LocalStorageConfiguration

Issues for integration/RWG discussions:
   * replace osg client install in release doc with EFC's InstallingOsgClient
   * organization of release doc table
   * design or integ shortcoming that would eliminate need for some doc?
   * twiki interface design -- move to 4.1 to change some underlying technology; structure is confusing.
