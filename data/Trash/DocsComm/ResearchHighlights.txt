---++ Procedure to Post Research Highlights

1. Get your images ready:
   * A square image inside an orange box ([[%ATTACHURL%/orange_box.psd%ATTACHURL%/orange_box.psd][download here]]) for the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/cms/?pid=1000074][research highlights]] page.
   * An image without the orange box for the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/cms/?pid=1000060][News from OSG]] page (and eventually, the home page), sized 66 px wide x 76 px high.
   * An "artistically-cropped" image for the home page, sized 350 px wide x 72 px high.
   * Upload these with the Image Manager
   
2. Create new web page for RH.
 
   a. In cms, create a new HTML page that is *online, but not visible*.  The title of the page should be the same as the title of the RH.
   a. Copy contents of a previous RH to make it easier so you can just cut and paste. Be sure to update titles, etc.
   a. Images within the tables should be cropped and resized to 200 x 200 pixels
   a. For "click for larger image" use the original files. 
   a. This might be a good time to work with the other versions of images (see steps 4 and 6 below). Be sure to name them logically; the file name shows in the browser.

3. In cms, relocate web page so it is under the About the OSG > > Research using OSG > Research Highlights section.

4. Update [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000074][Research Highlights]] page
   a. Use image with [[%ATTACHURL%/orange_box.psd][Orange box]].
   a. *Use PIDs, not Friendly URL names!  Format:  _/cms/?pid=xxxx_

5. Update [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/cms/?pid=1000060][News from OSG]] page.   Use 66x76 pixel image, without the orange box.

6. Update [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org][OSG home page]]
   a. Use your 350 x 72 px image, or create your own size, but don't make any wider or higher.
   a. Follow the existing design of page, adding the appropriate caption, title and pulling the first paragraph or so of text from the article.
   a. Move the most recent research highlight out of the "featured" spot and to the top of the list of three -- or two, whatever the case may be -- research highlights.  You can use the small image for that rh used on  [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/cms/?pid=1000060][News from OSG]].
   a. Delete the last research highlight (if there are more than two listed or if the page looks crowded.)  

Details and misc. notes:  

   * (jn 7feb07)Could do step 1 and work with images a couple days ahead of time. Also the short text for home page, news & events and science on the osg.  
   * mt:  if using a large image, use the FTP site to upload
