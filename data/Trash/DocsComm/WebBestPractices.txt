---+++ News Items

There are three "news" pages:
   * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&elMenu=Home][Newsbox on OSG home page]]
   * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000060][News & Events page]]
      * "News from OSG" section - for OSG-issued items and press releases, new research highlights (press releases should also be posted in appropriate section of http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000084][News page]])
      * Images in this section should be no wider than 150 pixels.      
      * "OSG In the News" section - for mention of OSG from other sources; (should also be posted in appropriate section of [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000084][News page]])
      * "OSG Newsletter" secton - updated each time a new issue of OSG news comes out;

   * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000084][News page]]
      * News items from above should also be posted in the appropriate areas here.

*News Posting Rules:*
   * Keep the news box on the home page as uncluttered as possible.  Delete old items as they pass.  Keep no more than 3 news items on the home page whenever possible.
   * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000085][Upcoming Events]], are typically posted here, not in the news area on the home page, unless specifically requested.
   * All events that are posted on the home page should also be posted to the appropriate events page, either [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000085][Upcoming]] or [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000096][Past]].

---+++ Images
   * Images in the "News from OSG" section on [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000060][News and Events page]] should be no wider than 150 pixels.
   * Images on [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000074][Research Highlights]] page should be cropped to 200x200 pixels and put in orange box (attached).
   * Always use alt tags on images 


---+++ Links
   * All links pointing outside of the OSG website should be given the target="_blank" attribute.
   * No "click here" or "go to http://..." phrases.  Hyperlinked text should be meaningful


---+++ General Items

   * Avoid bolding text that is not a heading.   There is a difference between leading the eye to certain key points, and creating a distraction so that people do not know what to focus on or where they should read first.
   * Don't change spacing on items.  Keep them as close to how they are now as possible.
   * Keep formatting the same.  For instance, all dates should be formatted the same way.    
   * CHECK YOUR WORK... All changes immediately go into production, unless "visible" is not picked for the page attributes, so be sure to make sure there are no errors after you submit the page. 
---+++Page Review
   * Refer to [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/DocumentationProject/ReviewProcess][ReviewProcess]] to see how often certain pages should be reviewed/updated and by whom.
