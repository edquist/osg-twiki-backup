---+++ News Items

There are three "news" pages or areas:
   
1. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&elMenu=Home][Newsbox on OSG home page]] 
   * Press releases by OSG or partners or consortium members (where OSG is mentioned)
   * Any article in a major publication that prominently mentions OSG or quotes Ruth (Science, Nature, New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Computerworld, etc), 
   * Upcoming OSG and closely-related events

2. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000060][News & Events page]]
   * Generally, everything you post in the newsbox, plus new Research Highlights and items that might not fit on the home page get posted here.
      * "News from OSG" section: 
         * Images in this section should be no wider than 150 pixels.      
         * "OSG In the News" section - for mention of OSG from other sources; (should also be posted in appropriate section of [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000084][News page]])
      * "OSG Newsletter" secton - updated each time a new issue of OSG news comes out;

3. [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000084][News Archives page]]
   * News items from above should also be posted in the appropriate areas here.

*News Posting Rules:*
   * Keep the news box on the home page as uncluttered as possible.  
   * Delete old items as they pass.  
   * Try to keep no more than 3 news items on home page whenever possible.
   * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000085][Upcoming Events]], are typically posted here, not in the news area on the home page, unless specifically requested or a Consortium Meeting.
   * All events that are posted on the home page should also be posted to the appropriate events page, either [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000085][Upcoming]] or [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000096][Past]].

---+++   CMS Tips (tips for Content Management System)
   * Online vs. Visible
         Online:  the page is available over the Internet
         Visible:  the page is visible in the left-hand menu, if it&#8217;s parent is visible also.

   * Editing &#8220;Tools for Collaborators&#8221; section:
      
   1  Log in 
   1. Go to the home page 
   1. Click on your name at the top so that you're using the inline editor 
   1. Click on 'edit' right above "Tools..."




---+++ Images
   * Images in the "News from OSG" section on [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000060][News and Events page]] should be no wider than 150 pixels.
   * Images for [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000074][Research Highlights]] page are discussed on the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/DocsComm/ResearchHighlights][Procedure to Post Research Highlights]]
   * Always use alt tags on images 


---+++ Links
   * All links pointing outside of the OSG website should be given the target="_blank" attribute.
   * No "click here" or "go to http://..." phrases.  Hyperlinked text should be meaningful


---+++ General Items

   * Avoid bolding text that is not a heading.   There is a difference between leading the eye to certain key points, and creating a distraction so that people do not know what to focus on or where they should read first.
   * Don't change spacing on items.  Keep them as close to how they are now as possible.
   * Keep formatting the same.  For instance, all dates should be formatted the same way.    
   * CHECK YOUR WORK... All changes immediately go into production, unless "visible" is not picked for the page attributes, so be sure to make sure there are no errors after you submit the page. 
---+++Page Review
   * Refer to ReviewProcess to see how often certain pages should be reviewed/updated and by whom.
