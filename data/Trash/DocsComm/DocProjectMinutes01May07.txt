---+ Documentation Project meeting agenda/minutes 1 May 07
Attending:
   * Anne, Forrest, Tim, Kyle, 

---++ Things that have come up

---+++ Chris G's Site Test Summary pages [[http://home.fnal.gov/~greenc/site_tests/Engage_20070417/]]

From last time:
   * RQ will ask colleague (Arvend? didn't catch name) to look at CG's stuff, then get back to him.
   * RQ will ask Ruth about hosting CG's web pages at GOC, and get back to CG
   * CG will make decision about whether to host at FNAL under opensciencegrid name, or at GOC.
   * CG will make web site available under the VO twiki; maybe a link from VORS (too soon to tell)

CG to call RQ.

Kyle: this may have more to do with integration than doc,  %BR%
Chris: for doc, where do I host the results of tests that I do?

---++ CE install guide
   * CE install guide too long, unweildy, comprehensive; they suggest adding simpler guide: picking the most usual path and just giving the recipe. See http://t2.unl.edu/documentation/installing_vdt for an example
   * %BLUE%Anne working on cleaning this up -- in progress.%ENDCOLOR%

   * CE guide and other doc frozen for 0.6.0.  Once I revamp the doc, it's been tested, and we agree it's "better", I'd like to unfreeze and replace current with new.  Issues?
   * Talk to Rob Q, Kyle under orders to not let anyone touch that doc.

   * make navigation to it very easy and clear (Forrest?)
   * clean up all old links in twiki -- we should each take a few pages each time.  Here are some to start with; let's assign:

[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/WebHome]] FC %BR%
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/MailingListsSubscribe]] KG %BR%
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/Trash/IntegrationGridWhatIs]] CG %BR%
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/ProductionGridWhatIs]] CG %BR%
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/MonALISA]]  AH%BR%

---+++ Look and feel of doc twiki
   * status?
last time: Forrest: nothing yet in production, implement first on dev twiki, then move to test twiki on cmssrv09...8443, then when EB signs off, move to prod; now: testing on pattern skin.

---+++ End user doc
last time:
   * Forrest: Ruth asked about status of User Guide that you're working on; https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/GridUsersGuide; most recent edit 01 Feb.

last time: Forrest: what is meant by "user", above doc is complete, but not sufficient. Question about testing for accuracy.
Also: Need to know how to create/port app, the JDL, how to run app. Where, what are auth's, can my app get what it needs, etc. 

Forrest sent email post-meeting 3 Apr: I have started documenting what it will take to run a job on the OSG. See:
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianSandboxTesting
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianCanIRun
I think that the Porting The Application, which EGEE covers to great extent
in their documentation, is what we are missing.

   * AH: does someone need to review this?  Is it ready for that?

---++ Action Items
 From above 17 apr 07:
   * AH to update wbs
   * AH -- go through GOC list for VO liaisons, call them %BLUE% emailed most; VOs with no listed support emailed to goc %ENDCOLOR%
   * Add google searches -- AH and FC to discuss how best to implement %BLUE%policy decision to be made by controlling board, implementation: kyle needs robots.txt file. list of each page (naming conventions irregular); why are meeting notes considered by google to be better than others?  Search optimization -- who could look into this?  How to approach Ruth & co.  FC to push to Jen. %ENDCOLOR%
   * Craig -- look over existing doc and old KB stuff

From 24 apr 07 (2nd half of meeting):
   * AH to think about process for review and maintenance %BLUE%not done%ENDCOLOR% 
   * AH to talk to Ruth about who to review FAQ -- docs group already busy at 110%
