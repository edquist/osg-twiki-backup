---+ Restructuring the TWiki for Better Service

The current structure of the TWiki webs serves neither the user nor the administrators. Nor us. I suggest that we aggregate some of these into sub-webs. I suggest the following structure. I am using  "Support Webs" as separate from the Documentation but I can see how you could argue that they belong together. Certainly the OSG @ WORK webs do not need to be displayed to every user: they provide very little for the regular user.

The OSG Governance webs also are not something that most people will be interested in.

They are still available and listed, just not right there in front of people. By making the subwebs, we can take advantage of some listing technologies for the sidebar or even dropdown menus that are supported in future versions.

The moves can be accomplished by the systems administrators in the file system, outside of TWiki.
