---++++ Monthly OSG Newsletter
[[CommArticlePlanning#NewsLetter][List of Planned Newsletter articles]]

Katie Yurkewicz, Marcia Teckenbrock, Anne Heavey and Jen Nahn produce and publish newsletter. Contributors vary by issue. Ruth Pordes always contributes "From the Director".

[[NewsletterPublicationSteps][Procedure to Publish OSG News]] covers which pages to update and how to send the newsletter via email.

Task as of Dec 2006: ask at all activity/TG weekly meetings what members would like to see, how often they want a newsletter, etc. %BR%

Mission of Newsletter: (Anne's 1st draft 22 Dec 06; will evolve as previous task completes) Provide a forum for communication to members of OSG such that they may easily keep abreast of activities, events, goals, issues and milestones regarding both the OSG infrastructure and research that uses OSG resources.

Tasks:
   * determine content: share between Ruth and Anne, Marcia, Jen
   * collect input from OSG members (how is TBD)
   * interviewer/author/editor for OSG stories: share between Anne, Marcia, Jen
   * review: Exec Board
   * final edits: Anne
   * publish: Marcia (needs backup, need to cross-train)

Feature stories may be written by communications team or researcher/developer. Steps for writing/obtaining feature stories:
   1. Identify feature topic and the aspect(s) to cover
   2. If communications team to write, 
Proposed OSG Newsletter Articles:
      * develop questions
To get ideas, go to monalisa plot, see what VO's have been done recently, pick others. Try to vary the type of research month to month.  Also get ideas from Ruth, EB.

Do other non-NEES NSF-funded projects use same form and template?  What's the award number, and does it vary from VO to VO?

KY says we can use research highlights, modified appropriately (sample nuggets in Anne's email from KY 21 Dec 06)

Question: Is there a call for nuggets in 2006-2007?  Who do I contact?
---+++ Coordinate with EOT

#GeneralTips
---+++ General tips for communications role

   * reporting style of writing -- get tutored on basics
   * recommended books: Elements of Style, On Writing Well (Zinsser), AP Stylebook, American Heritage Dictionary
   * read Symmetry, NYT Science Times, GridToday, other grid newsletters, other lab newsletters
   * use rss feed for quick web searching
   * set Google alert on: opensciencegrid OR "open science grid" OR grid OR computing OR cyber
---++ Misc "on the plate" from Dec 2006
   * email 12/21: suggestion to run workshop to train agency officials in basic Grid technologies, Feb-Mar timeframe, from Paul Avery. (I sent email to PA inquiring)
   * invited to contribute education and training article in the IEEE online journal. (Maria Ganzha" <ganzha at euh-e.edu.pl) 21 dec 06 from KY. Goal of edu column: to let the community know about innovative ideas and success stories in courses, student projects, educational programs, and other education-oriented activities related to "distributed systems" topics.
   * work on strategic communication plan
   * Question by KY about iSGTW: is it acceptable to ask people to alter a previously-published article for iSGTW? If you were to submit an article to a publication, how would you react to such a request?
   * Contact organizations listed by Paul (under Contact persons, below)
   * figure out where Mike and Paul in EOT interface to communications
   * attend activity/tech group meetings to ask about what's wanted in OSG newsletter
   * awaiting OSG citation blurb from KY

Upcoming meetings: 
   * OSG: March
   * Teragrid: early June

---++ Contact persons
   * Jon Bashor does computing-related communications at LBL;  he's now doing some communications work for ASCR (the Advanced Scientific Computing something-or-other in the DOE; JBashor at lbl.gov, 510-486-5849
   * From Paul regarding iSGTW contributions: "We can probably identify organizations to send material, but generic ones will need constant reminders since it will not be a high priority. Thinking ahead, I believe that we might be able to exploit places like SDSC, NCSA, TACC, Oak Ridge, Argonne, Indiana/NOC, LSU/CCT/LONI, SURA, JLab, SLAC, PNNL, I2 and NLR because they have existing PR machines and represent groups that have high cluster/network/Grid awareness" 

---++ Anne's other questions/comments
   * How to decide what goes to OSG newsletter, OSG RH, iSGTW article?  
      * 1 RH/mo, does double duty as iSGTW feature?  Also can be NSF nugget?
      * 1 newsletter feature/mo -- only for newsletter? Also can be NSF nugget?
   * list everything that goes into News
   * I want to meet with members of EB to get their input on role of communicator, what they want to see.
