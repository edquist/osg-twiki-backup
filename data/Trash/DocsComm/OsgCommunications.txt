are things organized as they should be? Maybe needs some work %BR%

everyday accounts and things: MT/MH

---++++ iSGTW contributions
      * Interview
   *
Develop and produce talks, brochures, posters, exhibits and other OSG-related materials.
[[http://www.nees.org/Research_Activities/NSFNuggets/MakingNuggets/][NEES Nuggets primer]] and [[http://www.nees.org/Research_Activities/NSFNuggets/MakingNuggets/nugget_template.ppt#256,1,PI Name & Equipment Site  Award #][template (for NEES)]].  

Do other non-NEES NSF-funded projects use same form and template?  What's the award number, and does it vary from VO to VO?

KY says we can use research highlights, modified appropriately (sample nuggets in Anne's email from KY 21 Dec 06)

---++ Contact persons
   * Jon Bashor does computing-related communications at LBL;  he's now doing some communications work for ASCR (the Advanced Scientific Computing something-or-other in the DOE; JBashor at lbl.gov, 510-486-5849
   * From Paul regarding iSGTW contributions: "We can probably identify organizations to send material, but generic ones will need constant reminders since it will not be a high priority. Thinking ahead, I believe that we might be able to exploit places like SDSC, NCSA, TACC, Oak Ridge, Argonne, Indiana/NOC, LSU/CCT/LONI, SURA, JLab, SLAC, PNNL, I2 and NLR because they have existing PR machines and represent groups that have high cluster/network/Grid awareness" 

---++ Anne's other questions/comments
   * How to decide what goes to OSG newsletter, OSG RH, iSGTW article?  
      * 1 RH/mo, does double duty as iSGTW feature?  Also can be NSF nugget?
      * 1 newsletter feature/mo -- only for newsletter? Also can be NSF nugget?
   * list everything that goes into News
   * I want to meet with members of EB to get their input on role of communicator, what they want to see.
