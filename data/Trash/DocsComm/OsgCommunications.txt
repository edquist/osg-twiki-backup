---+++ Weekly report to NSF/DOE
Mail to: editor at isgtw dot org

OSG communicator responsible for contributing one U.S. grid story per week
   * approx once per month should be OSG (can run simultaneously as RH and/or OSG newsletter article?)
   * find contacts in other grids (get lists from KY)

Roles:
   * interviewer/author/editor for OSG stories: share between Anne, Marcia, Jen
   * reviewer: Exec Board
   * final edits: Anne
   * backup iSGTW publisher: Anne (and Owen of EGEE)
   * contact for non-OSG contributing editors from U.S.: Anne?

---+++ Monthly report to NSF/DOE
Hasn't been started, just suggested.  FNAL OPA does one.  KY email 11 dec 06.

---+++ Assist with OSG Scientific Publications
   * Maintain DocDB
   * Work with end user scientists to Cite use of OSG services, resources, middleware, appropriately in their publications and talks. 

Roles:
   * DocDB admin: Marcia (backup?)
   *
---+++ Provide "Nuggets" to NSF
[[http://www.nees.org/Research_Activities/NSFNuggets/MakingNuggets/][NEES Nuggets primer]] and [[http://www.nees.org/Research_Activities/NSFNuggets/MakingNuggets/nugget_template.ppt#256,1,PI Name & Equipment Site  Award #][template (for NEES)]].  

Do other non-NEES NSF-funded projects use same form and template?  What's the award number, and does it vary from VO to VO?

KY says we can use research highlights, modified appropriately (sample nuggets in Anne's email from KY 21 Dec 06)

Question: Is there a call for nuggets in 2006-2007?  Who do I contact?
---+++ Coordinate with EOT

#PrDocsMaterials
---+++ PR Documents and Materials
General: Develop and produce talks, brochures, posters, exhibits and other OSG-related materials.

See Paul's folders, understand Ruth's objections to glossy brochure.

Collected Documents and Materials:

   * [[SC06Materials][SC 2006 Materials]]
   * OnePageHandouts
   * FNAL OPA uses 
   * recommended books "Elements of Style", "On Writing Well"
---+++ Attend Meetings and Conferences
   * Determine which to attend (Anne to attend 2 OSG, 1 Teragrid per year)
   * May be 1 iSGTW editorial board meeting per year (Anne)
   * Other grid, science, communication-writing?
---++ Misc "on the plate" from Katie Dec 2006
Role at meetings:
   * Find people in different roles/groups, talk with them about what they're doing (not a formal interview)
   * NWICG press release announcing partnership with OSG -- no link to it yet (from email 11 dec 06)
   * maybe set up interviews ahead of time
   * attend talks
   * reporting style of writing -- get tutored on basics
d227 1
   * recommended books: Elements of Style, On Writing Well (Zinsser), AP Stylebook, American Heritage Dictionary
   * read Symmetry, NYT Science Times, GridToday, other grid newsletters, other lab newsletters
   * OSG March
   * use rss feed for quick web searching
   * set Google alert on: opensciencegrid OR "open science grid" OR grid OR computing OR cyber
---++ Misc "on the plate" from Dec 2006
   * email 12/21: suggestion to run workshop to train agency officials in basic Grid technologies, Feb-Mar timeframe, from Paul Avery. (I sent email to PA inquiring)
   * work on strategic communication plan

d242 1
   * OSG: March
   * Teragrid: early June

---++ Contact persons
   * Jon Bashor does computing-related communications at LBL;  he's now doing some communications work for ASCR (the Advanced Scientific Computing something-or-other in the DOE; JBashor at lbl.gov, 510-486-5849
   * From Paul regarding iSGTW contributions: "We can probably identify organizations to send material, but generic ones will need constant reminders since it will not be a high priority. Thinking ahead, I believe that we might be able to exploit places like SDSC, NCSA, TACC, Oak Ridge, Argonne, Indiana/NOC, LSU/CCT/LONI, SURA, JLab, SLAC, PNNL, I2 and NLR because they have existing PR machines and represent groups that have high cluster/network/Grid awareness" 

---++ Anne's other questions/comments
   * How to decide what goes to OSG newsletter, OSG RH, iSGTW article?  
      * 1 RH/mo, does double duty as iSGTW feature?  Also can be NSF nugget?
      * 1 newsletter feature/mo -- only for newsletter? Also can be NSF nugget?
   * list everything that goes into News
   * I want to meet with members of EB to get their input on role of communicator, what they want to see.
