---+++ Review one-page handout draft by Marcia

---+++ Grid Cookbook

Katie: I was 
to provide some case studies from OSG. A little information about what OSG 
is, plus how some experiments are using it. There would need to be some 
technical detail; it's something that is supposed to be a resource for 
people interested in the grid (either just at a high-level or people who 
actually want to do things).

Outline & status as at http://www.videnet.gatech.edu/gtcb/draft %BR%
Evolving Cookbook is at http://www.videnet.gatech.edu/gtcb/outline

---+++ OSG website (Anne's thoughts)
Why doesn't home page have 1-liner or obvious link to "what is OSG"? I think it should (besides the "About OSG" nav button).

---++++ Popup menus
About OSG: 
   * Remove Glossary (add it to "Getting Started")
   * Add "Grid Architecture" (maybe rename to OSG Architecture and add definition of "service"); remove it from " Getting Started"
   * Add "See the OSG Working" (short description/illustration of workflow showing submit node, CE, SE, then show how you can use Monalisa and gridcat to "see it working")

We used to have animation about how grid works. Why taken out? Can we restore and link from "what is grid computing"?

About OSG -> Who is OSG
   * Do we maintain a list of individuals anymore?  Or a list of institutions with a contact name?

About OSG -> OSG Organization ->
   * Computing and Data Storage Resources   <---- Add this beneath VO in menu

Getting Started:

   * Add: How to Participate (We used to have a "how do you want to participate?" page. Where did it go? Can we restore?)
   * Replace "How to guide" with "Technical Documentation" (add short paragraph about different roles/tasks, then point directly to twiki doc page)
   * Software, Policies, Support, OK
   * Add Glossary
   * Remove Architecture

Contacts:
   * Can we have each institution listed with at least one contact? (I've needed this info, even if end users haven't...)
