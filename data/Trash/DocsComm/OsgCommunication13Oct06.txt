---+++ Review one-page handout draft by Marcia

---+++ Grid Cookbook

Katie: I was 
to provide some case studies from OSG. A little information about what OSG 
is, plus how some experiments are using it. There would need to be some 
technical detail; it's something that is supposed to be a resource for 
people interested in the grid (either just at a high-level or people who 
actually want to do things).
