---++ Content Changes - from previous meetings (still to be done)

	* On each "main level link" make it policy that every "sublink" is described on the main content page. - long term (Content provider responsible.)
	* Documentation Menu - removing the second link on the left menu is just fine.

	* Want to move with the new layout and the new box simultaneously.  Ruth wants this asap.

---++ News Box
 

---++ Topics

	* Review of TwikiWebs - will send out email to web owners asking for web to be looked over
	* 0.4.1 Documentation - Was the transition smooth?  What could be better?
	* New server - still working on service agreement, but Kyle has access to server and can start putting new template on the server, but, I don't have access to create new files, which will make the new template fairly impossible to install.
	* Fermi mySQL script


---++ Other Topics

	* Doublecheck that Ruth will come to SC/Ops meeting 1 day early to talk with Kyle, etc.
