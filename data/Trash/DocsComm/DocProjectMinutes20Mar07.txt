---++ End-user doc
   * idea: move current end-user doc from twiki to web site (mostly contextual/explanatory/introductory info)
   * point users to VO sites and to VO/WebHome for links to those sites and/or actual info provided by VO
   * identify and approach VO liaisons for end users
   * help users find accurate site information -- Is their VO supported? Does their app run?
      * it sounds like VORS is missing some info relative to !GridCat ... Rob, can you summarize situation?
      * what are users doing
      * what are VOs doing to take care of this for users?

---++ Admin doc
   * Identify different roles -- what are we missing on Documentation/WebHome ?

---++ Twiki structure
