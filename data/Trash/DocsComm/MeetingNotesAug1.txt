---++ Last Meeting's Notes



---++ Trouble Tickets

   * 2281 - News and Events box simlinks
   * 2282 - Broken links - This should be taken care of, but again, without rolling through the whole site, it's hard to know.

---++ Content Changes - from previous meetings (still to be done)

   * On each "main level link" make it policy that every "sublink" is described on the main content page. - long term (Content provider responsible.)  -- I suppose this will be taken care of by Xenomedia
