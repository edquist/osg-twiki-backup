---+ Documentation Project meeting agenda/minutes 15 May 07
Attending: FC, AH, CG, KG, FL, RQ

---++ Things that have come up
   * Mats Rynge from RENCI to review FAQ
   * AH asked FC to create stable link for users to access latest training doc in education twiki
   * we can restrict !DocsComm, just need to make it clear on twiki home page and left nav bar (Marcia to do)  (use allowwebview, then set web to be private)  member of griduser or admin group, can see, 
RQ: gridgroup
KG: allowtopicview anyone can do, can do robots too, needs full path to each file, needs to be more exact, have to go through KG to change. %BR%
Decision: Let's set top level with robots, and everything below should be restricted too.

From FC's status rpt:
   * twiki skin, look&feel handoff to RQ and KG; FC to resend email about nat skin; apply first in test env, used by U of Hamburg and twiki.org, solves prob of CSS creating issues w lockup in firefox; pattern skin currently overly complex; nat skin changes our env, allows us to change left bar to be hidable, jump bar elim, adds wikiwig editor, but is major addition, lots of plug-ins; look won't change much; will take EB decision; can roll out web by web, but install affects entire twiki installation%BR%
RQ and KG to talk about the test env.

   * install of CE client (testing [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide]]?) may require install as root, KG has installed as nonroot -- FC to discuss with him; it installs but it won't run.
   * certif installation -- how does this compare with what's in CE install guide? [[ReleaseDocumentation/CEInstallGuide#Configuring_the_Public_Key_Infra]] Need info on how to transform it into what it needs, p12 to whatever. FC found instructions -- we need to enhance our instructions with this.
   * please explain the app porting issue; CG: have app, want it on grid, come in with constraints, make existing sw operate in grid env; putting together start-up info from CG's experience; FC capturing CG's story (miniboone); CG: what questions to ask yourself about existing setup: what do you need to change and how to change;  end of June
   * let's not keep helpful instructions buried in the sandbox, but link to them from the Doc twiki as "under construction but useful"
   
---++ Chris G's Site Test Summary pages
Can CG give status? Where are you going to host results?
Status: CG got reply: approved by Ruth : have user-support.opensc... domain hosted by fnal, run out of afs space; can put results there. Then we can point into it from wherever.

[[http://home.fnal.gov/~greenc/site_tests/Engage_20070417/]]

From last time:
   * RQ will ask colleague (Arvend? didn't catch name) to look at CG's stuff, then get back to him.
   * RQ will ask Ruth about hosting CG's web pages at GOC, and get back to CG
   * CG will make decision about whether to host at FNAL under opensciencegrid name, or at GOC.
   * CG will make web site available under the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo twiki; maybe a link from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS (too soon to tell)

---++ CE install guide
   * AH created [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]["streamlined" guide for root install, Condor, full priv, no SE]]; still needs work, testing (not sure about firewall stuff; is Monalisa going away?). 
   * Need another common scenario to streamline -- JW says use gridmap instead of full priv
   * Need to go through UNL's guide to compare

---++ Old Links in twiki
   * clean up all old links in twiki -- we should each take a few pages each time.

porting and client install

Forrest sent email post-meeting 3 Apr: I have started documenting what it will take to run a job on the OSG. See:
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianSandboxTesting
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianCanIRun
I think that the Porting The Application, which EGEE covers to great extent
in their documentation, is what we are missing.

   * FC mentions tagging plug-in, heavily used, stable

Action items from 15 May:
   * AH to think about process for review and maintenance %BLUE%not done%ENDCOLOR% 
   * AH to follow up with VOs for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/webhome page%BLUE%not done%ENDCOLOR%
