---+ Preparation for starting co-editorship of !iSGTW
---++ General
   * meet with Xenomedia to learn about updated content mgmt sys for isgtw (Apr 22 10am)
   * attend 4/21 adv board meeting 
   * think about how to keep up on conferences, events, what to read
   * read isgtw from different point of view: what kinds of announcements, what kinds of stories, balance of topics, etc.
   * approval process for articles should be "lite"
   * talk to Sheila Cisco about video conf options (EVO)?

---++ Agenda for three-way phone meeting with Cristy and Dan (one of Apr 18-24)
   * Go over the documents she sent 4/16
      * passwords file:
         * 2nd item: news login and pw for netscape -- what URL? How used?
      * vague mailing list -- used for what? Are they all subscribed?
      * who's been in isgtw -- useful to expand this to have columns for topic, project name, institution(s), contact?
      * annual status report: visibility - how to measure? How to create partnerships?
      * marketing report 31 Aug 07: what's been done since? (I know posters, post cards, Also, in upcoming OSG RH brochure.)
      * I think we have list of everything to do for an issue; weekly to-do list?
   * gridcafe-isgtw connection status, direction
   * 

From phone meeting 4/18:
   * takes two weeks to produce an issue; content and layout go hand in hand; layout is tedious
   * work a couple of issues ahead
   * constantly generate content
   * ping conferences 2-3 months in advance; ask about keynote speakers, other speakers 
   * Cristy does a lot by email less by phone; Dan likes to work by phone
   * plan to present at adv bd meeting
      * alternating responsibilities, week by week; Dan & Cristy 4/23; Dan to publish 4/30; and , Dan & Anne 5/7, 5/14 (Dan to publish); Annd 
      * alternating lead feature US, EU every other week
      * 

Idea: add Dan to my google calendar

   * More questions for Cristy
      * list of contacts from grid projects (who else?)
      * what google alerts do you have set? What RSS feeds?
      * who do you regularly or occasionally get articles from (Sarah Pearce? Faith? anybody at SDSC?)
      * distribution lists
      * how much do you travel to conferences to get stories; if don't travel, do you contact presenters? How do you pick what to cover?
      * things currently on the plate that we should know about -- articles in the pipeline
      * are there any emails to send introducing Dan and myself to contributors (e.g., if a personal relationship has formed)?
      * what her goals, strategic direction, philosophy have been, where she sees isgtw headed
      * reporting structure, approvals for articles
      * advertizing: do you send poster to conference organizers to post?  Who can we send postcards to?
      * business cards -- just make our own?

      * What works, what doesn't?
      * How many articles get sent to the sharing sites listed at bottom of article pages?
      * feedback: what are people looking for and reading?
      * how do you use !SciVee?

   * Questions for Dan
      * verify dates of my trip to CERN are ok; Tues 5/6 - Tues 5/13
      * my responsibilities up to 4/25? (furlough 4/28-5/4)
      * brainstorm initial ideas about isgtw
      * my summer schedule (70% time, taking about 4 more weeks off before Sept 30 for furlough, training and mandatory vacation)

---++ Once I get to CERN May 6-13

   * go through Cristy's "story ideas" link (and find other links?), make tentative schedule of articles to shoot for
   * goals, messages, direction of isgtw (write/update strategic plan?)
      * so far science and grid technology, some opinion; what about policy (e.g., funding agency goals), 
   * collaborative workspace wiki for coordinating content
   * do I need CERN account so that we can share a storage/working area?
   * balance: EU, US, rest of world
   * tools (for image management, video conferencing, communication, searches, etc.)
      * Google alerts, RSS feeds -- from what pages?

      * BIOCOMP, Las Vegas July 14-17 http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp08/ws

My figuring and planning
   * see my CommArticlePlanning page for OSG-related articles
   * OSG articles needed before Sept 30: 1/mo = 5  (CDF/DO Higgs, LIGO, CMS data xfer, Virial-Shultz, maybe VCell?, rework Catherine Blake article?)
   * US articles needed: 2/wk - 1 every other week for non US, non EU story. 21 weeks = about 30 (not including links, images)
   * If Danielle does 3/mo, that's about 15 which is about half.  Need to direct her to the stories, though. If no Danielle, yikes!
   * That leaves me with about 10 non-OSG stories to write/commission.
      * NG is good site, maybe  a couple from http://www.ngp.org.sg/applications/index.html
      * Get 2 or 3 from Faith on !TeraGrid
      * NCSA http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/ Angela Wilson, U of N Texas, Chemistry
      * IBM's world community grid http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/  Maybe African climate?
      * maybe something happened at CLADE in March; http://www.cs.okstate.edu/clade2008/
