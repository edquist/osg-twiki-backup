---+ Agenda and Minutes for 10 Nov '06 meeting

---++ A few things on Anne's mind
   * I need to get back up to speed; have spent a couple of weeks exclusively on CMS. What's happening?
   * OSG news: do we want to have internal type news too, e.g., "VDT just dropped packages x,y,z from release a.b.c"
   * Star Grid question: Jerome says best to use OSG/STAR grid in title
   * Next consortium meeting planning: Ruth will just talk to Katie and Frank at 11:30, and will bring AH and MT in later. Penelope will be doing some of the organizing, it sounds like.
   * SC06 material prep: Post mortem, lessons learned?
   * Any response to MT from Mike W or Paul A re: cookbook?

---++ And on Katie's mind:
   * iSGTW launch scheduled for next week. OSG/FNAL participation? OSG content for future issues?
   * Everything else ready for SC06?
   * Next OSG news - still trying to track down LHC articles
   * Does Ruth need any new one-pagers after SC06?
   * Next research highlight - CDF?
