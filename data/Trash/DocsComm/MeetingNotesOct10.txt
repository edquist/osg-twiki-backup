---++ Agenda for osg-docs meeting Oct 10, 2006
%TOC%

---+++ Possible CMS news item
Combined Computing, Software, and Analysis challenge of 2006 launched

Possibility for later Oct or Oct/Nov newsletter?  Research highlight?

How best to link?

---+++ Review VO twiki

Anne's thoughts: %BR%
Define use better:

Change intro text to include something like:

Record your VO-specific practices, configurations, etc. for users and admins. (Because in the OSG-wide doc area, I can't document VO-specific things, and I need a place to point readers.)

   * Each VO to have page on which
      * there's some introduction (ATLAS' is good, http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/ATLAS, iVDGL's is also good http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/VO/IVDGL)
      * Link to experiment/project home page
   * VO-specific implementation of OSG (e.g., which Privilege components, use VOMRS or not, ...)
   * VO Application info, both for user and for administrator
   * How-to join VO, for user
   * What CAs users should use to get certificates
   * How do users run application (app doc should be on VO home web site, link to info)
   * How do users select resources when submitting job (I think this is VO-specific...)
   * VO app-specific troubleshooting info
   * VO-specific support info
   * Define VO-specific OSG admin roles if different from defined in Documentation web
   * List VO groups and roles used for authorization
   * Link in news articles

Idea: have table (one row per VO, as is) with more columns, columns would link to pages with info as listed:

Add legend to explain headings (per Penelope)

| VO name | Util Status | User info | Application | Support | Groups/Roles | Success/Failure |
| intro, link to home pg | (as is) | how to join  | how to run app  | support info | list grps,roles, associated privileges | rate at each site |
| VO implementation of OSG | | how to select resources | app admin info | | experiences |
| link to news | | what CA to use |  | | gripes, suggestions, etc. |

---+++ Documentation Twiki

I rearranged doc twiki, complaints? suggestions?

I'll need to get content/reviews on variety of topics.

---+++ New website
Anne's proposed changes http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/OsgCommunication11Oct06#OSG_website_Anne_s_thoughts

Content providers list %BR%
http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/DocumentationProject#Content_Tsars %BR%
How to get the "unconfirmed" to confirm?

---+++ Doc-DB
Ruth said: I still think this page needs more text and introduction etc. http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/

---+++ OSG Graphics
(Our) need and interest in a  graphic artist who could create useful graphics for your new open  grid web site:

Marcia and Anne to proceed with a  requisition to cover this activity on the OSG task code
