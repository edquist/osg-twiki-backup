---+ OSG Communications weekly Meeting Agenda and Minutes 26 Apr 07

Attending:  AH, MT, JN 

---++ What's come up recently
   * Too much work, not enough FTE's -- gotta prioritize, get others to contribute, and maybe let some stuff go
   * Set up clearer division of responsibilities: let's look at [[OsgCommunications#TasksAndRoles]] and discuss

   * JN to take contacting media outlets; AH to pass on info to JN
---++ OSG newsletter
[[CommArticlePlanning#NewsLetter][List of Planned Newsletter articles]]

   * This is Marcia's responsibility; communication and EB offer ideas, contribute (sometimes) and review.
   * Ruth wants it smaller (than this month and last), and not to require so much work and time.    
   * Don't include RH's, just link to the latest
   * Remember to contact activity leads to ask for news; provide them with deadline and follow up with phone call
   * for next month: Contact Ted H for SRM/dCache and John McGee for CI days

---++ Web site review
[[ReviewProcess][Review Process Page]]

   * Everybody's stretched, will have to still identify reviewers and pound on them to review
   * Ruth would like us to use this as a working meeting too, and pick one page to review during the meeting.  Best if we pick one ahead of time, and read it so that we can discuss effectively.  MT as webmaster should choose.  Let's start this week.  Looks like "contacts" and "mailing lists" are up for April. 

   * Mailing lists: recommendation: put link also under contacts.  MT to check lists by mailing; and ask about missing lists, ask for confirmation, email listserv admin
   * JN to check instructions on page
   * contacts page done; it's ok

---++ Research Highlights
[[CommArticlePlanning#ResHigh][List of Planned Research Highlights]]

Congrats to Marcia on finishing her first one!

   * For future: I want to come up with guidelines that we should all follow. I need to discuss with Vicky and some EB members first. 
   * Probably stick closer to 400 words, get scientist review 1st, Mike P 2nd, comm team 3rd, then Ruth and EB (for substantial edits, check with scientist)
   * Changing how we do edits: in general, we won't edit each others' articles; we provide comments and suggestions, but author makes all edits. 
   * Publish to osg site first, isgtw reprints and thus does not edit (goal)
   * Name and date accompany RH on osg web page

---++ iSGTW Contributions   
[[CommArticlePlanning#IsgTw][List of Planned iSGTW articles]]

   * new hire to replace Danielle in June, Christy
   * idea for isgtw from Kent: add a "send this link to a friend" link
   * Rosetta article should be ready soon

---++ News items

---++ DocDB

---++ "On the plate"
