---+ Notes from users meeting 26-27 Jul 07

8:30
   * Ruth has a slide on OSG scope 
   * Focus on storage areas this year -- we have directories, but need more
   * sw contributed from outside
   * consortium: all instit and projects that contribute (once you register a resource, vo, user, you're part of consort.)
   * project funded to provide staff
   * longer term issues (from nsf presentation)
   * slide on becoming a full osg "citizen" -- fit into "getting started"
   * 
Anand Padmanabhan (now at Urbana Ch) -- troubleshooting
   * problem-oriented documentation, troubleshooting guide ; will work with user support and users on how best to do this
   * idea: make sure Chris has talked with Anand before Aug 1 meeting...
   * CG question: what problems are appropriate to troub as opposed to GOC: Anand: any day to day problem, user problem
   * troubleshooting button gets your problem to both GOC and troubleshoot or VDT -- the man behind the curtain distributes appropriately
   * Mike Diesburg: turnaround time; AP: differs depending on complexity of issue, but will respond quickly RQ: within 24 hrs; but solution may be later!
   * started in May, have had 5 problems
   * AK: Rob will cover when to submit here, when to submit elsewhere
   * Qusetion about whether to go straight to goc or to site sysadmin -- KC: go through goc so they can see patterns;
   * AR: there are some tickets that have been open for a long time; RQ: don't have access to each site, VO SC is responsible; goc can ping; goc did a site survey, goc is waiting on response
   * VOs claim there are sites that that say they support vo but don't. AP: says they can follow up; RQ: there is a test tool, not perfect; would need a cert for each vo to test absolutley but don't want to do that.  There is MIS vo, only cert they hold.  Too much ops overhead.  DB: glidein jobs that work on some nodes not others in one site  RQ: MIS tests will pass on that, CG: spot a poison node, send to GOC; KC: worker nodes are not covered on these tests
   * AP: also have to work with sw devs. As link between sites and vos, need to put in place processes to penalize "bad" sites
   * RQ: sites are not required to support any partic vo
   * CG: but it's meant to be open; 
   * RQ: there are some who only are open to own vo; we can maybe enforce min num of vos, but can't force them to support given vo; 
   * AK: problem is where they say they support, but don't
   * CG: maintian list of ones who nominally support a vo, and those that 
   * and site admins needs to know; can be admin error and list
   * RQ: we are actively removing sites that "don't play game"

Gabriele: info systems  right now (RESS, BDII, VORS) then Chris on info systems, what's been happening lately (gratia)

Gabriele
   * slide of IS goals: realtime info, monitoring tools, ... resource selection
   * propagate info from site: vors and cemon (based on info prov)
   * IS: branch to condor/schedd: can support multiple ress's; any vo/usr can attach to the osg ress today.    Other branch (to condor matchmaker) used by engagement (right branch in slide)
   * ress is scalable to current requirements
   * ress motivations
   * used today by D0 and engagement; do users need it?
   * scalability: what are the req's; can you handle 40k job/day; gg: reqs are published; main stakeholder was D0; if diff needs, can extend architecture; can use ress as source of info and do matchmaking elsewhere like engage does
   * walk through how to get to ress doc: twiki, resource selection, planning doc, d0 requirements
   * user and admin doc sec on the twiki page
   * ~garz/ReSS/ReSS-prd... fancy plot

Chris -- VORS
   * DB: easy way to tell size of site? CG: vors doesn't tell # of WN.  RQ: this is available but not thru vors (lost what, GIP?); keep track of total num; 
   * VORS is snapshot
   * VORS vs RESS: complementary; read about res VORS, num of total jobs RESS (glue schema); info programatically: RESS, BDII have interfaces; real question: if I can implement an interface, what's most effecient way to do: read:VORS, other:RESS (runs on sites 0.6.0)
   * Nik Kur: how many sites rporting correct info: GG or Mats: sites and how big: 1/2 rpt correctly; some report site-wide, some vo-spec, so things will show up mult times; engage isn't using that info, looking for how many jobs can get on sites; thinks size of site is bad metric
   * wants dynamic info: how many wn's avail: GIP provides this; if config'd properly, is reliable

Gratia
   *
