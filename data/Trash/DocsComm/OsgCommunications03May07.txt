Lots of these are "homework" rather than easily reviewed in our meeting (for example, checking that consortium, partners, VOs are up to date). Maybe look at Who is OSG or What is Grid Computing together.  Also -- what about that home page and the campaign alert? Is this now final?

---++ Research Highlights
[[CommArticlePlanning#ResHigh][List of Planned Research Highlights]]
Jen has a question for Anne about Biomoca, how do we define "results".
