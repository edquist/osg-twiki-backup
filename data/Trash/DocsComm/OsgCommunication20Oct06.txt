---++ OSG website (Anne's thoughts)
%BLUE%
%ENDCOLOR%

Why doesn't home page have 1-liner or obvious link to "what is OSG"? I think it should (besides the "About OSG" nav button).
---++ Add tech publication info?

Miron: It would be good to have this information on our web site so that we can refer people to it. Also, we should have "recommended" text for including OSG in the acknowledgements of a publication. 

---+++ Popup menus
About OSG: 
   * Remove Glossary (add it to "Getting Started") done 10/20 AH
   * Add "Grid Architecture" (maybe rename to OSG Architecture and add definition of "service"); remove it from " Getting Started" (renamed it 10/20 AH)
   * Add "See the OSG Working" (short description/illustration of workflow showing submit node, CE, SE, then show how you can use Monalisa and gridcat to "see it working")  10/20 Still to do

We used to have animation about how grid works. Why taken out? Can we restore and link from "what is grid computing"? (MT sent to AH, I need to look at it)

About OSG -> Who is OSG
   * Do we maintain a list of individuals anymore?  Or a list of institutions with a contact name? 
No

About OSG -> OSG Organization ->
   * Computing and Data Storage Resources   <---- Add this beneath VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in menu (NO, changed my mind AH 10/20)

Getting Started:

   * Add: How to Participate (We used to have a "how do you want to participate?" page. Where did it go? Can we restore?) 10/20 AH -- it's there
   * Replace "How to guide" with "Documentation" (point directly to twiki doc page) done 10/20 AH
   * Software, Policies, Support, OK
   * Add Glossary
   * Remove Architecture (rethink)

Contacts:
   * Can we have each institution listed with at least one contact? (I've needed this info, even if end users haven't...)
NO

Under Documentation.Tools for Collaborators %BR%
Add a direct link to the documentation twiki (/Documentation/Documentation.WebHome), and call the link "User Documentation" or "User/Admin Documentation".  Done 10/20 AH

Changed VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo page in site %BR%
pid=1000068, VOs: Add "what is a vo"  Done 10/13
