---++ Agenda
---+++ Paul and sending isgtw to fund agencies
Rp; continue process KY had, change person.
KY: have rp talk to PA

---+++ Clearly define terms
   * partner
   * member

Marcia thinks this was an agenda item at an EB meeting? %BR%
RP sent her defs to Bill Kramer, no response, now she'll send to council and cc us.

---+++ Publications
(from email from Marcia):
This is essentially the information included in ArXiv:

Abstract%BR% 
Version/s of document:  (URL or PS, PDF, etc.)%BR% 
Title:%BR% 
Authors:%BR% 
Comments:%BR% 
Journal Reference (if applicable):%BR% 

Is this sufficient?

-Marcia
minutes: %BR%
RP: cdf will put text in their papers, we can index their papers. Try it with
We'll provide them a sentence -- go to previous cdf papers, how do they ackno other people

KY: we should provide standard text %BR%
all papers after date, or all papers using data set?  Ans: all papers since some date, we say 9/1. (look in spires...)

We have email agreement from fkw, cdf was not copied; we're following up %BR%
KY to come up with draft text Wed 9/22

---+++ Vision for new OSG newsletter

Like LCG newsletter or LCG bulletin?
http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/LCGnews/LCGSepOct06.pdf, wider audience, LONG articles, published much less frequently %BR% 
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/LcgBulletins, for consortium members only, "what everyone should know", and appears every two weeks, no inline articles

KY suggests doing survey -- is current OSG news helpful, widely read? what info are consortium members looking for? 

audience is OSG consortium on weekly level, not involved in all tech mtgs

don't want the bulletin w just links. want more content, less structured articles, have 2-line updates, assumes context/history known.

mining the mails that come out, the mtg minutes

what do we want people to know %BR%
RP: problems, offers of help, what we're trying to accomplish at the moment, next goals, next release, key facts, leigh's biweekly ops rpt should be part of it (doesn't synthesize enough), 

how much is current one: MT a full week (format, emails, iterations, edits); want to keep columns, may want a new design, MT says it's fine. 

Ok, leave it as a monthly;
cover the meetings, go to them at the beginning, ask for input from the meetings, ask what they want to see; audience is ourselves%BR%
KY suggests: outreach to recipients ask what they want to see

KY: this what RP tries to do in her "from the dir"

RP: keep on as we are now until we get feedback

---+++ Webmaster responsibilites and reviews
Do we have A webmaster?  Who should it be and what should their responsibilities be?

Clarify desired review cycle.

Tasks:
Review pages for content and currentness (is that a word?) %BR%
Review pages for look and feel, grammar, spelling, other typos.  %BR%
Evaluate requests for changes  %BR%
Respond to requests for changes  %BR%

Ideas:
Each page should have a "responsible person" concerned with content and if it's up-to-date.

RP: MT is webmaster
KY explains: re updates, somebody needs to check for bad links, old pages etc. 

RP: MT to delegate admin stuff to MH and Selitha and others, as needed.  If DP needs somebody in security.  Need to ping people to update pages, etc.
---+++ Grids in China talk
Where will it be given?  Who is audience? What is thrust of information that brochure should convey?  Internationalism, interoperability -- but need more specifics

RP: CANS conference, tech people, talking to workshop mainly networking people, in general need to start more about data move, ntework, in pages, etc.  One of key contribs is hi trhuput, data movement. Don, Matt Phil -- use to get words

D0 has some sam install in china, haven't installed osg there yet

EU has EU-china initiative (not OSG) AH to ignore this!

contributing to wlcg, want to
ASGC -- running nanohub? get quote from Simon Lin connection at ASGC. KY to send info about him.

put in something from GGarz about D0 thing

Start with just changing the back.

show phedex picure of data xfer, in ruths sc talk

no feeback from osg brochure at sc06, slide show wasn't running. bummer.  was very science focused. quarknet had osg mentioned. 

was useful to have the brochures, ruth handed them out, but no feedback. RP suggests to ask Paul for feedback.

Various aspects of interoperabilty:

   $ The OSG works actively with partners, including grid and network organizations and international, national, regional and campus grids to create a grid infrastructure that spans the globe. OSG has established computing sites in the U.K., South Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil in addition to its sites throughout the U.S.

   $ The OSG and the European grid project Enabling Grids for E-SciencE (EGEE) use the same middleware infrastructure, the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT), thus facilitating interoperability. Both OSG and EGEE are partners with the worldwide LHC Computing Grid (wLCG). Academia Sinica Grid Computing (ASGC) participates in the wLCG's Distributed Deployment of Databases for LCG (LCG 3D), and (???) thus is an OSG partner.

   $ GLUE Schema v1.3: Joint activity among several largescale Grids with OSG included to enhance the GLUE Schema 1.2. Specifically, this activity reflects the interest of OSG to continue to promote the interoperability with peer Grids.

   $ OSG Information services GIP (OSG-GIP): has been developed to enable LCG-OSG interoperability, OSG resource selection services, GridCat?, etc. The GIP is a grid information service that aggregates static and dynamic resource information for use with LDAP-based information systems such as the BDII. The GIP produces information based on the GLUE Schema.

   $ There has been a lot of progress on Interoperability with the EGEE and WLCG projects: The deployment of a common Information System based on the BDII and Glue Schema and the development and deployment of Information Providers for the OSG are now available for installation on OSG Compute and Storage Elements.

   $ Other services that have been considered to support Grid interoperation include: Security (Authentication / Authorization / Accounting / Auditing), Data Storage (catalogues, storage interface, data transfer), and Job Management (submission, monitoring, resource selection, scheduling), VO-specific services.

   $ GRIP plan included work to make UNICORE resources available from Globus: (UNICORE used by German and Japanese grids...)
