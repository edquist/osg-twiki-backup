Marcia thinks this was an agenda item at an EB meeting?

Is this sufficient?

---+++ Vision for new OSG newsletter

Like LCG newsletter or LCG bulletin?
http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/LCGnews/LCGSepOct06.pdf, wider audience, LONG articles, published much less frequently %BR% 
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/LcgBulletins, for consortium members only, "what everyone should know", and appears every two weeks, no inline articles

KY suggests doing survey -- is current OSG news helpful, widely read? what info are consortium members looking for? 

---+++ Webmaster responsibilites and reviews
Do we have A webmaster?  Who should it be and what should their responsibilities be?

Clarify desired review cycle.

Tasks:
Review pages for content and currentness (is that a word?) %BR%
Review pages for look and feel, grammar, spelling, other typos.  %BR%
Evaluate requests for changes  %BR%
Respond to requests for changes  %BR%

Ideas:
Each page should have a "responsible person" concerned with content and if it's up-to-date.

---+++ Grids in China talk
Where will it be given?  Who is audience? What is thrust of information that brochure should convey?  Internationalism, interoperability -- but need more specifics

Various aspects of interoperabilty:

   $ The OSG works actively with partners, including grid and network organizations and international, national, regional and campus grids to create a grid infrastructure that spans the globe. OSG has established computing sites in the U.K., South Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil in addition to its sites throughout the U.S.

   $ The OSG and the European grid project Enabling Grids for E-SciencE (EGEE) use the same middleware infrastructure, the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT), thus facilitating interoperability. Both OSG and EGEE are partners with the worldwide LHC Computing Grid (wLCG). Academia Sinica Grid Computing (ASGC) participates in the wLCG's Distributed Deployment of Databases for LCG (LCG 3D), and (???) thus is an OSG partner.

   $ GLUE Schema v1.3: Joint activity among several largescale Grids with OSG included to enhance the GLUE Schema 1.2. Specifically, this activity reflects the interest of OSG to continue to promote the interoperability with peer Grids.

   $ OSG Information services GIP (OSG-GIP): has been developed to enable LCG-OSG interoperability, OSG resource selection services, GridCat?, etc. The GIP is a grid information service that aggregates static and dynamic resource information for use with LDAP-based information systems such as the BDII. The GIP produces information based on the GLUE Schema.

   $ There has been a lot of progress on Interoperability with the EGEE and WLCG projects: The deployment of a common Information System based on the BDII and Glue Schema and the development and deployment of Information Providers for the OSG are now available for installation on OSG Compute and Storage Elements.

   $ Other services that have been considered to support Grid interoperation include: Security (Authentication / Authorization / Accounting / Auditing), Data Storage (catalogues, storage interface, data transfer), and Job Management (submission, monitoring, resource selection, scheduling), VO-specific services.

   $ GRIP plan included work to make UNICORE resources available from Globus: (UNICORE used by German and Japanese grids...)
