Full:%BR%
I would like to commend OSG on the quality of both general, high level documentation describing the project's goals and mission as well as the technical documentation needed to describe site planning and software installation requirements and procedures. In addition to the thorough documentation I have experienced very good response to the questions I posed and help I requested during the initial steps of preparing NCSA to provide resources to the OSG community. I look forward to taking an active role in the OSG community in the context of providing NCSA HEC resources and facilitating access to other TeraGrid sources.

Looking through the Engagement presentations, I've gleaned a few more potential testimonials.  Some could use a bit of work, but they're starts: 1/30/08

D0, Brad Abbott (U of Oklahoma)

"Prior to 2006, we ran limited Monte Carlo production. Since using OSG, our MC output has doubled, enhancing our ability to perform analyses.  OSG will play a major role in D0 publications for many years."

"One analyzer needed 300,000 CPU hours to run -- this was impossible on our local D0 cluster. OSG provided resources, and the analysis was completed."

LIGO, Patrick Brady (UW-Milwaukee)

"LIGO is running Einstein@home on OSG sites to search for continuous sources of gravitational waves.  We've been able to make an impact on Einstein@Home scientific analysis."

STAR, Tim Hallman

"Using OSG we've achieved a 97% efficiency in simulation production, exceeding our expectations.  A several-thousand CPU hour emergency loan from FermiGrid made a difference, too. "

ATLAS, Jim Shank, BU

"U.S. ATLAS is still in the midst of a large simulation exercise, computing system commissioning and now the full dress rehearsal. OSG is delivering the CPU cycles we need, on a robust and stable fabric."

CMS, Lothar Bauerdick, FNAL

"CMS is preparing for data taking and data analysis, readying its systems for recording of collision data, running Monte Carlo simulation, and preparing to extract physics results. OSG is playing a crucial role in all these aspects for us.  OSG is active and supportive, and is solving real-world problems."

"CMS is using OSG in the U.S., and EGEE in Europe and Asia. 
Interoperability of grids is a major achievement -- driven by OSG."

"OSG has become a dependable facility for CMS on which the success of LHC physics computing can fully rely."

Information and Library Science (Engagement), Dr Catherine Blake Asst prof in School of Information and Library Science at UNC-CH

&#8220;Using the OSG for this task has reduced NLP analysis time for the TREC collection from weeks to only a few days. The dramatic reduction in running time has allowed us to experiment and to fix problems iteratively in the text preprocessing and NLP that would not have been possible on a multi-week time scale.&#8221;

Luettich: Coastal Modeling, Brian Blanton

"(The OSG Engagement team) and I set up a test to run on OSG. We set the coarse/fast ADCIRC system on 50,000 Monte Carlo simulated tracks that impact NC.  This was fairly easy to do, and this will allow us to explore sensitivities to track selections for the Flood Plain Mapping simulations."
