#NewsLetter
---++ List of Planned Newsletter articles
In past was KY and RP to figure out what articles to run. How to do it from here out?)
MT took newsletter from KY when KY went full-time.  Need to decide if MT continues, or who to take over what.
Need to do survey to find out what people want for internal newsletter.

To get ideas, go to monalisa plot, see what VO's have been done recently, pick others. Try to vary the type of research month to month.  Also get ideas from Ruth, EB.
