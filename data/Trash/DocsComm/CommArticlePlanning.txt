   * CHARMM (Jen for now) used by Molecular Dynamics group at U of Chicago. Mike Wilde will send JN info. Schedule this for late January perhaps.

#IsgTw
---++ List of Planned iSGTW contributions

Use our research highlights once a month; find other things from other grid projects in between.
   * JN Sergio Novaes - for what date?
   * maybe a profile on a Teragrid/OSG bi-grid person -- AH
   * PNNL is potential new user -- look into article/press release in October 07 time frame



#NewsLetter
---++ List of Planned Newsletter articles
As of Feb 2007: do not write separate application article each month; use research highlight. Write a technical article, profile, etc.

To get ideas, go to monalisa plot, see what VO's have been done recently, pick others. Try to vary the type of research month to month.  Also get ideas from Ruth, EB.
