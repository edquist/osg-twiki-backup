#IsgTw
---++ List of Planned iSGTW contributions

Use our research highlights once a month; find other things from other grid projects inbetween.

#NewsLetter
---++ List of Planned Newsletter articles
As of Feb 2007: do not write separate application article each month; use research highlight. Write a technical article, profile, etc.

To get ideas, go to monalisa plot, see what VO's have been done recently, pick others. Try to vary the type of research month to month.  Also get ideas from Ruth, EB.
