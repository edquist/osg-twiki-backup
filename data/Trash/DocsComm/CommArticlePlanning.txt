Use our research highlights once a month; find other things from other grid projects in between.

As of Feb 2007: do not write separate application article each month; use research highlight. Write a technical article, profile, etc.

To get ideas, go to monalisa plot, see what VO's have been done recently, pick others. Try to vary the type of research month to month.  Also get ideas from Ruth, EB.

   * Other Ideas for later:
      * AH: Overview of all the VOs (including or especially the testing VOs like MIS, OSG, gridex, ops...)  

   * Things dropped from past newsletters:
      * Networks article (Don)

   * Possible Profiles:
      * Craig Prescott, U Florida
      * Ben Clifford, University of Chicago
      * Miron Livny
      * Greg Sharp, Cornell (not 'til at least July)
