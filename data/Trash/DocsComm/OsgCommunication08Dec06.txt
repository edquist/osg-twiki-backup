   * Meeting with Paul Avery: 
      * Paul feels we need a brochure (KY agrees) %BR%
He has someone who no longer works for him who worked on layout last year if doing a brochure, we need to hire a professional.  Ruth thinks the old brochure is outdated.  
 
Paul may have a UFL person to help us; we need to finish strategic plan, then see what we need and whether Paul has someone to help.

   * *Graphic Artist*
      * MT:  PO issued  for graphic artist. Can he do brochure?
      * Ruth wants work done.  MT will find out what and will ask Ruth whether we can have graphic artist do brochure or hire someone else to make one.
We need to make sure we get files so we can make changes!!!
      * Other than that, football pool problem picture is first priority.

      * Need to get Ruth's opinion
      * We think it's too large, either rotate between news items or use list;  lose logo;   
      * [[http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/][http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/]]  is a nice, cutting-edge site.
      * What happened to live map?    
      * MT will ask Kevin if there is a way for us to edit so we can cycle through all news items and lose the list.  (KY:  either have list or have banner)
