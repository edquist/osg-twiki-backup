Are people reading it?
   * They scan it
   * Read profile
   * Read/scan "from the director"
   * Look at calendar
   * Nobody admitted to reading the feature article. Hmm.

Do they want it more often?  Nobody said yes.

How to tell me about newsworthy items for me to disseminate to consortium?
   * maybe email to osgnews-request at opensciencegrid.org
   * maybe twiki tag "newsitem" for me to do rss feed on (talk to Forrest)

What do they want to see?
