---++ To discuss with Ruth
   * Rosetta article -- John M wants original article published in OSG website.  It's over 700 words and written by people who typically write scientific journal articles. I'd prefer to put abridged version with a "read more". Your thoughts?

   * CI days meeting agenda and outcome -- website hosting at fnal, etc.

   * Oliver's demo -- Burt working on problem 6/12 ff.
   * John M doesn't think rosetta would make compelling demo. The researchers get out flat files from their grid jobs.  Then they search these files to find the right protein configurations. People unwilling to write interfaces just for a demo. 
   * proposed meeting at RENCI with John -- haven't heard back
   * meetings for OSG to attend in next 12 mos:  OSG meetings late July, CHEP07, OSG All-hands RENCI, March08, Supercomputing08, AAAS08, Maybe Asian Grid meeting next Feb-Mar,  Any wLCG events?

   * graphic put on back burner
   * Vo/WebHome -- sent out reminders, got a couple of responses, but still largely empty.
   * who's getting results on OSG for near future research highlights?  Clemson/Goasguen? GPN? biomoca? charmm?  
   * thinking of doing joint Accounting article with GridPP (Sarah Pearce)
      * done recently: d0, ligo nov06, atlas cms 3/07, star 10/06, cdf 12/06, atlas 7/06
   * think about doing multimedia for OSG
   * blog for installation and user issues in OSG -- idea on hold
