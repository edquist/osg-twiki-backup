---++ About Creating Twiki Pages
---+++!!Call for Contributions for Documentation Activity

The is the twiki space to be used to organize various OSG web development activities. It is a resource available to, and editable by, all OSG users (if you're new, register at [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TWikiRegistration][TWikiRegistration]]; Leigh will then have to add you to the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GridGroup][GridGroup]] to allow write access. To edit content, click on the 'Edit' button at either the top or bottom of any page and you will see how the pages are constructed. Simply add new text and click 'Preview' then (if it looks okay) click on 'Save'. Creating new pages happens automatically whenever you write a new (i.e. currently unused) [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/WikiWord][WikiWord]]. This is denoted by a ? after the word - clicking on the ? creates the new [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/WikiWord][WikiWord]] (also known as a 'topic'). Please feel free to correct any mistakes, and to add new information (using _[[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/GoodStyle][GoodStyle]]_ of course)!

---+++ Process for Changing Public Operations Pages
   Since we will be making recommendations and changing things rapidly in the next few weeks, while needing to retain consistency and coherence, content Tsar's have been appointed for each of the sections to have direct content control to the development Mambo instance. The intention is to have a nightly update of the prodution operations pages. There is a 4:30 phonecon scheduled every day to provide opportunity to discuss issue regarding the update. Persons with concerns about the daily update are expected to attend.

---++++ Best Practices for OSG Public Website
