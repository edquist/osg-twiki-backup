AH and MT to coordinate pages in website

The three last items under "tools for collaborators" on the home page should 
be more uniform. What I mean is, Monitoring and Support both point to web 
(non-twiki) pages, whereas Security now points directly to a twiki page.  I think we should pick one or the other.
   * AH to talk to Mine to make twiki page nicer and have intro
