---+ Documentation Project meeting agenda/minutes 10 Jul 07
Attending: kyle, chris, forrest, anne, tim

---++ Things that have come up
   * Craig has new hire that can work on documentation. 
   * RWG needs to organize the integration "small group" to look at release doc. Not sure who will be involved.
   * AH and MW are starting to organize edu/doc coordination. Status: 
      * Aug 1 doc meeting on hold; trying to make a plan before schedule a meeting
      * MW was going to make a page under Education -- Alina, do you know (I don't see it)?
      * Plan to discuss x-ref of edu and doc pages in these biweekly doc meetings.  
      * Conduct separate phone meetings as necessary.
   * I'd like to get ReleaseDocumentation.AdminDocCE in better shape soon.  Knowledgeable volunteer to review and suggest/make improvements? %RED% Horst was suggested.  AH can no longer find this page, however.  THere's CESiteAdminGuide%ENDCOLOR% Was it ce install guide?

Bottom line is that there are four main doc threads:
   * Integration, release doc
   * Doc and edu pages coordination
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-specific info
   * Documentation hub and pages to which its spokes point (needs to point appropriately to above three areas)

We need effort to go into them. AH can only offer .35 FTE, and will be responsible for helping reorganize integration stuff.

---++ Last time
   * CG to KG: status on sysadmin; waiting to bring up deve area on twiki (26 Jun; AH doesn't remember what action item was for this) CG: requires testing on dev stand and it's not ready, admin on vacation. Machine is there, but not ready. Status: waiting (not urgent)
   * AH emailed Gabriele on VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoServices. Email exchange ongoing -- I'm asking for structured info to make my life easier!

---++ Tim S
   * Status on resolving differences between the doc you created and what's at [[ReleaseDocumentation/OsgCEAuthorization]]. J Weigand says what you wrote is less complete than what was already there in the CE install guide.  Found 3 different sources in twiki.  He just wanted steps.   Tim to look into consolidating all this authorization info.  Talk about again at next meeting.
   * Need to figure out how to coordinate that doc for next release.

---++ Alina
   * Will try new "streamlined" guide when I tell her it's ready.
   * Education main page [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Education_and_Training]] - Alina, did/could you go through with Mike W?
   * Any news from Education/outreach?
   * How much time/effort can you contribute to doc and edu coordination effort?

---++ Craig
   * Hired a student (AH doesn't know name yet)
   * Thinks cert doc progress in 3-5 weeks (Alain R says: "updated its CA certificate distribution to reflect the contents of the IGTF 1.14 distribution." AH has email with ref URLS, but doesn't know significance of this. Will need follow-up please.)
   * New hire will come to Fermilab for sysadmin meeting end of July, plus extra day or two to discuss doc. 

---++ Forrest (and Chris)

   * Documentation.InstallingOsgClient is the _extended_ version that I created... It will be moved into ITB_0_7. Someone needs to decide if it should replace the version in ReleaseDocumentation. %BLUE%This needs to be part of the discussion for RWG "small group" for 080 doc%ENDCOLOR%
   * Forrest and Chris: update on app porting; (from last meeting ETA:  end of June)  Documentation.PortingYourApplication.  Status? %RED%If Forrest has no hours, can Chris work on this doc?%ENDCOLOR%
CG: would be nice to have ready by users meeting, but no time.  FC: will point to red books for now.

---++ Chris
   * I've pinged VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo contacts to fill in info in [[VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/WebHome]]; got limited response.  See previous meeting minutes to see status. Can you please follow up and get more compliance?

CG: users expect grid to be black box. how to tell them it's not?  we are not and cannot be just a tool.  Conceptions of "it should be simple" remain, even at level of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo admin.   AH to address this in talk at meeting. two audiences: raw user and vo people who put layers on top; to put layer on top, this is how you need to pass it on so we can point people to it.  AH to talk to Shaowen to coordinate.

at Users meeting: expecting VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo delegates, some smaller expts under fermi umbrella, some smaller indep's under OSG and Engagement.

   * JWeigand says I should mention gratia probes in my ce install guide.  What sort of info does installer need to know besides "globus-condor-setup includes the probes"?
CG: note after the install check x config file to be sure it says right thing.  common mech: multiple batch systems on ce. then need to run config command by hand.  CG to provide gratia config info.

---++ Anne
   * Ruth's email of 6/28 about VO (in regular website, not twiki) -- AH to address
   * for scidac handout I looked through and made some changes to:
      * edited Documentation/CertificateGet
      * ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide doesn't say upfront that you need linux; doesn't say why you might want to install as root or not; when it links to Pacman Guide, there needs to be a sentence at end of pacman install "you've finished pacman install"; ITB vs OSG instructions unclear; points to ReleaseDocumentation/CertScripts#FAQ (need to reconcile with cert stuff in FAQ); 
      * Forrest's client install is at Documentation/InstallingOsgClient.   IT IS BETTER THAN THE OFFICIAL RELEASE DOC GUIDE.
      * [[Integration/ITB_0_5/LocalStorageConfiguration]] may need some work  -- %RED%volunteer?%ENDCOLOR% Maybe Forrest when hours come in.

   * We need to look at release doc table, figure out how to organize and order it (AH to follow up with RWG)
   * FAQ issues remain -- (previous meeting minutes).  I would like to work with an "expert" to clean this up. Suggestions?  CG: Eileen Berman

CE install guide
   * [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]["streamlined" guide for root install, Condor, full priv, no SE]]; . 
   * AH talked w John Weigand about my CE install guide-- he had comments; I will retry install
   * Need another common scenario to streamline -- JW says use gridmap instead of full priv, generalize to any job manager (can't do yet)

From Forrest -- to bring up in talks with RWG and docs meeting:
   * "meta question being avoided here (Tim's Gums issue): why couldn't he accomplish this using the interface provided by the software? There may be a design or integration shortcoming that would eliminate the need for documentation."  Discussion?  Bring it up in integration meeting?
   * "our interface design is very poorly designed. We should move to 4.1 first since it changes some of the underlying technology. But the twiki interface is not serving anyone. Some of that is structural: having every Activity have their own web was a weird design choice that has turned out to be detrimental for the users."  Discussion?

---++ Old Links in twiki (page reviews)
   * clean up all old links in twiki -- we should each take a few pages each time.  
      * see previous minutes for what's done
For this week
   * Integration/ITB_0_5/LocalStorageConfiguration -- could use some work -- volunteer?

---++ Last time's Action Items
   * AH to think about process for review and maintenance %BLUE%not done (can't seem to get to it!)%ENDCOLOR% 
   * Forrest's certif installation in installing osg client -- %BLUE%Forrest, please make sure Craig and new hire are aware of this%ENDCOLOR%
   * Need expert review of GridUsersGuide to answer AH's red questions  --- %BLUE% Did we pick somebody to do this?%ENDCOLOR% -- ask Nicolai Kouropatkin (prod for SDSS and DES)
   * review pages as listed above
 
---++ Action items:
   * AH to check CESiteAdminGuide vs ce install guide (then ask Horst to review)
   * AH to finish 2nd round of "streamlined" ce install guide
   * AH to go over FAQ with EBerman
   * AH to bring up to RP & co that doc requires more effort
   * AH to do website VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo changes per Ruth.
   * AH to put together users meeting presentation (include expectation of simplicity issue)
   * AH to ask Steve Timm: (from CG): there is need for a cut-down client for someone who wants to submit jobs and no more.  If there's way to do it, say from your laptop, it's not written down.  Way to config condor to shuffle off to submit node?
   * AH to contact Edu group; no representation at today's meeting
   * AH to follow up with Craig about new hire; no representation at today's meeting
   * GGarz was asked to organize vo services info (by email, not in meeting)
   * TS to coordinate privilege doc
   * EFC: Once he has OSG hours again: PortingYourApplication, LocalStorageConfiguration

Issues for integration/RWG discussions:
   * replace osg client install in release doc with EFC's InstallingOsgClient
   * organization of release doc table
   * design or integ shortcoming that would eliminate need for some doc?
   * twiki interface design -- move to 4.1 to change some underlying technology; structure is confusing.
