---++Other Items

---+++OSG Workshops and Meetings Pages
   * We need to know what process Mari goes through to set up a meeting page and dupicate inside current webpage framework.
   * This includes registration, agenda, uploaded presentations, etc...
   * Mari may have this already set up, we should look at it and see if we can work it into the pages. We can then write a procedure to get this posted.
   * If a meeting is enterd, who is responsible for entry in the calendar.
   * Where does mail get sent for meeting page support? (Suggestions: OSG-MEETINGS list, *webmaster*, does Mari already have an answer to this?)
   * How do we request new meeting pages? (Through mailing in above point.)
   * How is the registration connected and done. (Using Mari's inside OSG page format.)
   * What is the recomended schedule of notifications? (Up to the meeting planner, no internal mechanism unless Mari already has one?

---+++Current VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo List
   * This should be pulled directly from the Registration DB. It will be the responsibility of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to keep their DB entry up to date. Once VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo approval occurs this will be entered automatically to the list.

---+++Is someone writing the Grid User Guide?
   * Should someone from the community support center take this on? Sending to Burt and Fred for discussion during tomorrows meeting. 

---+++Site Administration Guide
   * This should be updated on the Mambo with new production releases. Anytime the Twiki is linked from the Mambo site there should be a note that it is a draft document.

---+++Monthly OSG newsletter 

   * we need to know Katie's level of involvement, from there we can put together a template and determine what is next. 

Should we add a search box to the pages? Kyle will add this to the Dev site.
