---+++ OSG Newsletter Scope and Process
%TOC%

---++ Scope

The newsletter is to let people know specific things happening in OSG and to provide technical and practical information for readers, ie. what internet2 tools will be in VDT and when, what insight to using them is available and at what URL, etc...

Each technical brief should be no more than 100-120 words.

---++ Process

   * MT attends Area Coordinators meeting monthly and determines activities people are doing.  She makes a list of their responses with their names. 

   * MT forwards the list to JL and AS.  They press people for paragraphs about their activities. They receive paragraphs and may edit. They forward the result to MT who may do further editing (grammar, case, semantics; articles that are very long or out of scope will be sent back to the author by MT for re-writing).

   * MT sends completed pieces back to JL and AS.  They send out as an html formatted e-mail.  Those whose e-mail readers are set to not have html turned on are able to read it because it is basically simple formatted text anyway.  Those who have html turned on can read it directly (i.e., no application, like Acrobat, has to be loaded to view it.

---++ Other Notes
(Marcia estimates this to be one (MT) to two (DR) days per cycle. Cycle
right now is once per month although noises have been made about twice a
month but a lot there depends on the willingness of the authors to write
technical briefs; Marcia will charge her activity on this to some OSG activity code.

Briefs are expected from those with the expertise in their area. Marcia will author briefs for VO Group, web site or other communications activities, but is not a regular contributor of content.
