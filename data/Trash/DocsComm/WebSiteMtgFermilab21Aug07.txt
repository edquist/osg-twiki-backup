---+ Minutes for Web Site Review meeting Aug 21, 2007

_Attendees:_  Christy Burne, Chander Segal, Suzanne Gysin, Elizabeth Clements, Anne Heavey & Marcia Teckenbrock

---+++Audience for OSG.org:

   * At a grid school, Christy noticed there was a big gap between people wanting to port their apps, for example, and these people knowing how to actually do it.  (Scientists w/o a CompSci background are at a loss.)
   
   * CS:  It&#8217;s hard to know exactly who your audience is, so try to have a layered hierarchy where you start general.  
   
   * Before Chander came to work for OSG, he tried to learn about it from the website to no avail because the right info wasn&#8217;t there.  It was both a content and a navigation problem.

---+++Home Page
   * What info should the home page have?
      * What is OSG?
      * What is unique about OSG, what is the value added?
      * What can OSG do for you?  (That's really what the research highlight is supposed to get across) 

   * Should we put buttons for each audience?  But this presumes we know who are audiences are&#8230;

   * CB: Some people just want to know if they can do their science on the grid.  This info is not readily-available.

   * EC: The ILC website had tabs for &#8220;For the press,&#8221; etc. but found they were repeating content.  That might not be the case for OSG, so worth a thought.

   * EC: Figure out who key audiences are and draft 5 or 6 messages fo rthem.  Once this is done, everything else will fall into place.  This should be done every year or so.

   * CS:  Figure out what the most important aspects of the site are and focus on them.

_Research Highlight:_  
   * SG:  Why is a chemistry link (protein sequences) on the OSG homepage?
   * EC: Maybe rotate main image each time someone visits the page.  Have a short caption with a link to more info rather than having a static image at the top?

_News items:_
   * We don&#8217;t have that many news items.  Everyone thought our current news items looked okay.  

   * EC: Maybe do a profile on someone new:  &#8220;Who&#8217;s new on the grid this week?&#8221;

   * CB: It would be nice to have something that is always updating on the homepage (ie, CPU hours &#8211; something impressive).  Christy also likes the way the &#8220;Research Highlights&#8221; page is laid out.  It would be nice to have a series of smaller images on the home page in place of the map (or in addition to a smaller globe).

---+++About the OSG section:

   * CS: page is very vague and is a more organizational, more political page &#8211; not info for most users or for people to really learn about OSG.

   * CS: 3 audiences/purposes:
   1. Learn (for media or interested scientists)
   1. Use (for people who want to get started using OSG)
   1. Build (for people to run apps)

   * The ILC page has a lot going on &#8211; OSG looks less impressive based on the home page.  (EC:  ILC page is being redesigned.  There&#8217;s a little too much going on, but it is important for people to know)

---+++ Getting Started section:
   * SG:  Would first go to &#8220;At Work&#8221; to learn more about technical details (someone less experienced might not, but Suzanne found the info she was looking for in twiki).  She would not go to &#8220;Getting Started.&#8221;

   * Section should say how does a user engage in OSG and what it can do for me, if I&#8217;m a scientist. Currently, it doesn&#8217;t answer questions people have:  

   * What can the grid do for me:  Give me computing resources without a capital investment!
 
   * Move this section closer to OSG@Work

   * Perhaps this section is misnamed?  What about changing section to &#8220;Using the OSG&#8221; and keeping the first link under that section &#8220;Getting Started?&#8221;

   * Twiki home page needs a good redesign.  It serves two important functions:  (1) docs for site admins, resource providers and users; (2) for work people are doing on activities.

   * _Getting Started page itself:_  
   * add links at top to different questions
   * break up page into smaller chunks; start at a very basic level and link to successively more detail.
   * Focus most on the people *we want to join OSG*

---+++  Grid status map:

   * CB:  The map takes up 1/3 of the real estate and there is a lot of space within the map with no info (most of Asia, South America, etc.).  Make the map a smaller globe and people click on it for more information?  The concept behind it is cool, but currently there&#8217;s no payoff when you click on the link.

   * The map may confuse people (SG wondered why there were no CERN sites because she knew they used the grid). The [[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000465][April &#8217;07 Issue of Symmetry]] has a nice conceptual image that shows the cogs of a machine with CERN at the center.  Maybe we could do an animation or something similar with OSG in the middle and CERN as one of the cogs?

---+++ Tools for Collaborators:

   * SG:  Likes this section; if we are trying to make our website more functional, Apache.org is a good model.

---+++ Overall Comments:

   * Some pages are too wordy or info is repeated.

   * EC:  Give people an option of getting less or more info:  give a taste on the first page.  Then &#8220;click here for more info.&#8221;  ilc.fnal.gov has examples of this.

   * EC: there are very few images with people in them.  Funding agencies like to see people!  

   * Should we have a FAQ for more general questions (vs. Twiki FAQ for more technical issues)?

   * CS/CB: There are four ways to look at OSG in terms of customers:
   1. value delivered (funding agencies)
   1. how to work on/run jobs on OSG*
   1. how to bring resources*
   1. organizational structure, internal info and technical details 
* concentrate on these points to bring new people into the OSG

   * AH/MT to talk to Paul Avery and Frank Wurthwein about key ideas to get across.

   * MT to talk to Xeno Media to ask them to implement google search (there have been a lot of complaints about the built-in search function.)

   * Change &#8220;News & Events&#8217; to &#8220;News, Events & Media&#8221; so that logos, brochures and images fit nicely.  It&#8217;s not a bad idea to have these things available should people want them.

   * Overall opinion seems to be: Remove a lot of the extraneous information and point to the Twiki when necessary; Give people small bites of info and the option of learning more.

%RED%The following Agenda was created, but meeting was more free-form%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Welcome and Purpose

   * confusion of what's in  website vs. what's in twiki, 
   * navigation, content, organization.  
   * General   length of pages in website.

---++ Determine audiences

---+++ Some initial thoughts from JN, MT, AH
   * funding agency (statistics, research highlights, contacts, "what is osg")
   * potential consortium member ("what is osg", stats, software stack info, how to get started, find people to talk to)
   * application owner (doc on porting their app,)
   * end-user, (how to join (if not in established vo), how to run my app)
   * Resource provider (how to setup resource)
   * new OSG staffer/activity members  ("what is osg", osg organization,  find meetings, contacts, "at-work")

---++ Go through site map (includes home page discussion)
   * [[WebSiteMap21Aug07]]

---++ Identify and Prioritize content to provide/update, etc
