---++ Integration Meeting ReviewAll - 24 January 2008

attendees use Twiki and enter at Twiki. Even new people would reference Twiki, not osg.org

Pages/things people do look at:
   * monitoring/gratia
   * calendar of events
   * quick links : latest release release
   * footprints link (but now it's gone)

"When I can't find something, I go to the home page (and usu can't find it from there)"  But haven't looked
recently.

Would like to see:
   * VOs by site -- link exists under organization -- should there be another under monitoring?
   * If you can't find what you're looking for, click here:  -- get them right when they're having problems.

Should "For resource admins" link directly to twiki?
   * No comment.

Forums for finding general users:
   * Site Admin specific call about once/month
   * Email osg-users
