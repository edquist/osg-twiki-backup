---++ Graphics Requirements for OSG Images

All images used should meet these guidelines in order to be used for OSG promotional or online material .  The person responsible for the article/research highlight/etc. is also responsible for relaying this information to their contact for the article.

   *A. Artwork & Graphics are best when submitted in vector art (line art).*
Many of these types of files are generally created in Illustrator, CAD, or any variety of software programs that have the ability to create VECTOR ART graphics.

   *B. Images should be provided in high-resolution formatted files.*
A high-resolution pixel-based image is generally about 300 dpi at its size of reproduction (print quality) .

For example: an image that is 8" x 10" with the resolution of 300 dpi is equivalent to 2400 pixels by 3000 pixels. 

* Accepted pixel-based Image formats (in high-resolution) are the following: 

   * Eps
   * Tiff 
   * PDF 
   * Psd (native Photoshop files) 
   * Jpeg
