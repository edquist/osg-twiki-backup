---+ Schedule for renci trip

Things to accomplish
   * meet w Shaowen about troubleshooting FAQ, and also Rob Q about survey (we have no survey monkey license)
   * attend training on Thurs
   * maybe attend part of council mtg to discuss mission statement
   * meet w/ integ doc team to brainstorm about 1.0
   * discuss with Paul how to work together and then Pam stuff
   * Catherine Blake

   * meet w Cristy, Alina, Ruth about gridcafe-isgtw (they met; no clear agenda)
   * meet w Kyle - twiki issues (email sent 2/29) (done)
      * how to help twiki page owners update regularly. Automated emails? What tools does twiki have; use idea of Rob G's to make table of resp persons and when last updated by them; google search problem
   * Michael Thomas from Caltech
      * has job monitoring tools for admins, not for end users; maybe there'll be something in ws-gram
   * meet with Britta about LIGO (email sent 2/29 p.m.) (done)
      * also talked with kent blackburn about ligo (done)
   * meet with Anand? about OIM (met w Rob Q, Kyle, Tim)
   * be available Tues 12-3 to help with photo shoot; 12:30 group shot in atrium (done)
   * meet w Doug Olson about Xeno CMS tutoring (done)
   * got two more testimonials: Leesa and Doru Marciesiu (marciesiu@ncsa.uiuc.edu)

Meeting notes (Kyle, Tim, Rob)
   * There's a "default" web: ...bin/view/_default but it won't affect existing pages
   * Kyle isn't expert on twiki, suggests that I look stuff up myself, post to forums etc; says they're pretty helpful
   * will be updating to new version, maybe good time to clean up list of webs (I should come up with a plan)
   * fixed user registration for editing twiki page so people know they need to be vetted.
   * they can track twiki stats
   * will set up development/test twiki where we can test resetting preferences, etc. and test plug-ins
   * they're busy on OIM -- will replace and enhance registration db (for res, vo, sc); all reporting stuff will be in one place (will take care of all vors info too); will allow for finer grained info and querying.  oim.opensciencegrid.org
   * communications wants "can't find what you want" button to go directly to form that emails osg-docs.  I can set up standard webform in twiki then action will point to script in goc site that will send (after 1.0)
   * want separate security form, too, to send to security@fnal.gov (robq to talk to mine)
   * GOC site is not for linking from home site -- all the info people need should be in twiki!!!

---++ Tues 3/4 mission statement conversations:
   * the one most people liked best (at least as a starter): "To enable sharing of and democratic access to integrated, autonomous High Throughput Computing resources in order to broaden the opportunities for participation n global 21st century research." Comments:
   * John M: misses key point Miron made: OSG is a place where communities can come together to open their research systems to the broader scientific communities
   * Doug O: "research communities"
   * Chander: I'm going about it all wrong, it's for the PIs and exec team to draft. That said, ditch "democratic", ditch "global" (funding agencies fund national grid), his off-the-cuff "Promulgate shared cyper infrastructure 2nd to none; enables science for stakeholders use and evolution of the facility"
   * Miron: ditch 21st century; should be timeless. Find vision statement (Chander emailed to me today). We're changing landscape of interaction between science and computing. Both a technology factor and a human factor.  Grid as a "movement" ( see his CHEP 07 talk) also Interview in Symmetry with Vicky and him.  Fundamental component both consumer and provider -- everybody gives something and everybody gets something -- need self interest; sharing, compute and data-intensivve science. Mission to have impact on science, democratize science.  Grid is a sociology, a way of doing business
   * Abhishek: increase effectiveness of usage and broaden participation, also "enable"
   * Paul: HTC is a Miron word; shouldn't be in mission statement; missing "shared resources" or "shared computing infrastructure", enable seamless access to shared resources.
   * Kent: ditch "democratic"; tone down political-speak; add "community sharing"; parallel computing, MPI is orthogonal to HPC. Maybe use "hpc" (lower case).
   * Fred L: lose "sharing", just "enable democratic access", drop "in order";  try "integrate autonomous, world-wide" and "efficient use of".
   * Marco: "enable and coordinate" , be authority to set rules, ditch "21st century", express differently, maybe "data-intensive", distributed system.
   * Kate K, Ann C: parallel vs HTC; add HPC, distributed
   * Mark G (at same table): but it IS HTC


Vision statement approved by ML and RP:%BR%
We envision the permanent operation of a large-scale, robust, flexible and secure cyber-framework by a consortium of stakeholder research communities and institutions. The framework leverages members' shared computing resources and human expertise, making it possible for them to address far more challenging problems than what would be possible using isolated resources. Both the consortium and the framework serve the interests and goals of the stakeholders, who make all decisions.

My new mission statement from this and remarks gotten today:

To enable, transform, and broaden participation in data-intensive science through a community-driven, efficiently shared, mutually-beneficial cyber-framework.

Kate and Alina: too many adjectives, artificial, hype, made her want to laugh.

 
---++ Comments on website from Paul, Rob Q, ...
   * couldn't find info about allhands meeting -- big events need to be bigger on home page
   * don't link directly to GOC -- it's for "so what the $##%!! is "GOC"? Links to ticketing, security, etc. should be in twiki
   * 

---++ LIGO talks with Britta and Kent

Sw upgraded constantly; currently in preparation fro a science run starting in about year and a half.  Data taking for preparation involves calibrating device. Artificially stimulate it and measure resonances/response.  Then do "science run": no stimulation, measure resonances/responses. Then calibrate again: discern trends, changes; interpolate to analyze science data.  Liken to shaking a bridge, measuring  response, then let cars go on, extract info from natural resonance of bridge, shake again.

(Kent) ligo data analysis could be off, they're setting upper limits (like x-sections in HEP)

There are 4 search groups:
   * binary inspiral ( 2 neutron stars spiraling, may give off grav waves?) we have good understanding of what analysis involves. LDG is scaled for this.
   * burst analysis (supernova, other short-lived bursts)
   * stochastice background (analogous to microwave background in astron); more computing for imaging required, still working to understand challenges
   * pulsar source (Anne: like lighthouse) <??> quadrupole moment; due to doppler, there's a diff frequency at each position it's measured. Requires interpolation. Theoretically could measure forever. (uberDAG vs little DAGs: lots of little calibrations, and a big calibration; gives something to interpolate between)

So why does LIGO care about OSG?  LDG (ligo data grid) uses similar technology (VDT, globus) and want to keep these tools evolving in direction that serves them; OSG provides leverage.  LIGO apps could literally use ALL the computers on earth, there's so much data. 

Took the seti@home approach, and as part of NSF's "100 anniversary of Einstein" program, LIGO launched einstein@home.  It processes about 1TB/day, and over 2 yrs is about 1PB of data.  OSG and LDG together would add only a few % to what einstein already provides (40k CPUs).

Computing side: 
   * UberDAG -- works with all data -- no distinction at boundaries, not enough disk space ANYWHERE (looking into SRM)
   * scientists restructuring their analysis to break up into smaller units; split into little DAGs, Britta has to force boundaries into it.
   * so for science run, data is split
   * uberDAG manages DAGS (DAG is concrete description of job, DAX is resource-independent abstraction -- the "what" not "how")
   * currently the uberDAG is running successfully on LDG using condor_submit_dag uberdag
   * LIGO scientists want it just as easy and very similar to submit on OSG -- no extra layers of complexity.
   * Britta's part: split into little DAGS (have dependencies on each other, but not MPI), implement Pegasus workflow on DAX.
   * Little DAX -> Pegasus -> Little DAG -> run on OSG.

---++ more stuff
   * linda akli -- grid cookbook should be linked properly


Mission statement and standard one-liner for PR materials.

Any chance to talk to council?
