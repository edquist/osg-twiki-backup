---+ Schedule for renci trip

Things to accomplish
   * meet w Cristy, Alina, Ruth about gridcafe-isgtw
   * meet w Kyle - twiki issues (email sent 2/29)
      * how to help twiki page owners update regularly. Automated emails? What tools does twiki have; use idea of Rob G's to make table of resp persons and when last updated by them; google search problem

Meeting notes (Kyle, Tim, Rob)
   * There's a "default" web: ...bin/view/_default but it won't affect existing pages
   * Kyle isn't expert on twiki, suggests that I look stuff up myself, post to forums etc; says they're pretty helpful
   * will be updating to new version, maybe good time to clean up list of webs (I should come up with a plan)
   * fixed user registration for editing twiki page so people know they need to be vetted.
   * they can track twiki stats
   * will set up development/test twiki where we can test resetting preferences, etc. and test plug-ins
   * they're busy on OIM -- will replace and enhance registration db (for res, vo, sc); all reporting stuff will be in one place (will take care of all vors info too); will allow for finer grained info and querying.  oim.opensciencegrid.org
   * communications wants "can't find what you want" button to go directly to form that emails osg-docs.  I can set up standard webform in twiki then action will point to script in goc site that will send (after 1.0)
   * want separate security form, too, to send to security@fnal.gov (robq to talk to mine)
   * GOC site is not for linking from home site -- all the info people need should be in twiki!!!

   * Michael Thomas from Caltech
      * has job monitoring tools for admins, not for end users; maybe there'll be something in ws-gram

   * meet w Shaowen about troubleshooting FAQ, and also Rob Q about survey (we have no survey monkey license)
   * meet with Britta about LIGO (email sent 2/29 p.m.)
   * meet with Anand? about OIM
   * be available Tues 12-3 to help with photo shoot; 12:30 group shot in atrium
   * attend training on Thurs
   * meet w Doug Olson about Xeno CMS tutoring


Mission statement and standard one-liner for PR materials.

Any chance to talk to council?
