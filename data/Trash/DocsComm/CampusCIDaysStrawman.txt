   * rotate a highlight about one of the 4 major participants, 
   * rotate a highlight of a participating campus, 
   * rotate a research highlight enabled by campus CI,
   * include short blurb of NSF's 21st century CI goal (strawman follows)

NSF has put forth a vision for cyberinfrastructure in the 21st century with the goal of encouraging and facilitating the future progress of science and engineering and to allow broad participation in these fields. The CI technology is advanced enough for a coordinated investment to make HPC tools, shared resources and important data available to all fields of research. 

NSF wishes to foster community-based CI planning and implementation, support for emerging and underserved communities. and forums for input and discussion between academia, federal agencies and private sector organizations.

| At the heart of the cyberinfrastructure vision is the development of a cultural community that supports peer-to-peer collaboration and new modes of education based upon broad and open access to leadership computing; data and information resources; online instruments and observatories; and visualization and collaboration services. Cyberinfrastructure enables distributed knowledge communities that collaborate and communicate across disciplines, distances and cultures. These research and education communities extend beyond traditional brick-and-mortar facilities, becoming virtual organizations that transcend geographic and institutional boundaries. This vision is new, exciting and bold. - Arden L. Bement, Jr. Director of NSF |

EDUCAUSE, Internet2, Open Science Grid and TeraGrid, all of whom are at least partially funded by NSF (true?) have come together to help implement NSF's vision. These organizations wish to share their expertise and resources with colleges and universities in the U.S., and to learn more about the needs of these institutions in order to evolve their tools and services to better meet these needs.

---+++ About campus CI
First let's tackle Cyberinfrastructure. We think of CI as a distributed computer with computation, storage, input/output, software, and management all at different locations, using the network as its backplane. The different pieces and functions of the computer are provided and used by many people in many different locations, and as such, combine to form a complex system. With the aid of good user management tools, user interfaces and workflows, the complexity is largely hidden from the researcher.

Campus CI may be a "distributed computer" shared campus-wide or among certain departments.  It may consist of campus computing facilities shared  with other campuses or with a regional or national CI. There is no single definition!
 
---+++ Mission
The mission of the four participating national CI projects is very much aligned with NSF's mission: to introduce CI to a broad range of academic researchers and facilitate their entry, via campus-centered efforts, into the HPC and data-sharing communities, with the goal of promoting progress of science and engineering.
 
The campus-centered efforts are designed to bring together players from campus, regional and national CI projects to share information and plan how to provide CI functions for the campus.

---++++ What's involved? 
(This is mish-mash from UCD presentations --)
   * Identify strategic directions for IT investments that enable campus to meet its distinctive needs (Walker 4/7 ppt)
   * Consultation with campus stakeholders, governing bodies
   * Study critical success factors: common artictecture, end-user support, collaboration infrastructure, network services, ubiquitous access 
   * Assess current infrastructure; determine needs (h/w and s/w)
   * Identify Wide Area Connection Points (Hess 4/7 ppt)
   * Learning and workforce development
   * Coordination of campus data center, networking, research groups

Players: 
   * Campus IT, Network Providers, Security/Access coordinators, supercomputer sites, grid organizations, collections organizations, policy/leadership/funding, discipline groups (researchers) (from Russ' 4/7 ppt)


---++++ Determine your goals 
(Maybe this is part of "what's involved" ...)

---++++ Request CI Day visit  
Link to the contacts page?

---++++ Prepare for visit
(again... Maybe this is part of "what's involved" ...)

   * Formulate questions to address with Campus CI days participants

---+++  Technologies


---++++ networks 
   $ Internet2:

---++++ distributed resources 
   $ OSG: The OSG Consortium brings petascale computing and storage resources into a uniform grid computing environment. Members of the OSG Consortium contribute effort and resources to the OSG infrastructure, and reap the benefits of a shared infrastructure. Computing and storage resources are integrated from more than 50 sites in the United States, Asia and South America. (link to list of sites with info about each)
   $ TeraGrid: ...

---++++ grid tools and services
(from OSG website) A grid is made up of four layers of resources (hardware) and software. Each layer of grid architecture depends on the one underneath it:

   * The network layer is the base. It connects...
   * ...the grid's resources, which make up the second layer. In addition to processing power and files, this layer may include data storage, databases, software repositories, and even sensors like telescopes, microscopes, and weather balloons!
   * On top of the resources sits the third layer, the middleware, the "brains" of the grid. This software does all the work to connect users' jobs to computing resources, thereby hiding the grid's complexity from the user.  It has the unenviable job of making many different networks and resources appear unified.
   * Most people only interact with the fourth and uppermost layer, the application. This is the most diverse layer, as it includes virtually any program an end user wishes to run.

The structure and layers may vary somewhat from grid to grid, but these are the essential components. 


   $ OSG: The software stack relies on the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) middleware, which is itself a packaging and distribution based on the NSF Middleware Institute (NMI) releases of Condor, Globus and other standard Grid middleware.  (link to info about software stack and its components)

   $ TeraGrid: ...

---+++ Services
This is meant to describe services provided by the participants, not "cyber-services"...
---++++ documentation 

---++++ access to resources
   * EDUCAUSE's Net@EDU program provides administration of campus and state networks
   * Internet2 provides network capabilities and collaboration tools and services
   * OSG provides opportunistic access to computing and storage resources
   * Applications can be adapted to run on OSG; many successfully running on OSG
   * TeraGrid provides free resources to academic researchers 
   * TeraGrid supports large set of running applications and gateways

---++++ software 
   * OSG Provides integrated, common software infrastructure, with software stack for download to servers and clients. (link)
   * don't know about others

---++++ security
(from OSG website) Stringent requirements for security and accounting differentiate grid computing from other distributed computing models. Grid user authorization, for example, is handled through Virtual Organizations. A VO  must authenticate and register its members, and enter into agreements with the other VOs on the target grid to define which resources are shared, who is allowed to share them, and the conditions under which sharing occurs. The middleware implements these agreements.  

---++++ training 
   * OSG offers training at sites around the U.S. and abroad
   * OSG offers training at its annual all-hands meetings
   * OSG's training materials are online (link)

---++++ support 
   * OSG relies on VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo for first level user support; provides Grid Operations Center for second level.
