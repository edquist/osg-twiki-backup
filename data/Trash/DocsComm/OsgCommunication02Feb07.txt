   * AH and RP to write for newsletter (then also for Getting started page in website) "what does it take to join OSG?"
   * Can we track how many hits we get to given twiki pages?  How many people hit the very top twiki page? If enough, we could add a section on "techy news", and advertize it in the newsletter.
