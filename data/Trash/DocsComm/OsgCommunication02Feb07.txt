---+ OSG Communications weekly Meeting Agenda and Minutes 02 Feb 07

Attending:  AH, MT, JN, KY

---++ OSG helpdesk tickets and info flow to Xeno Media
MT believes we need to start using GOC more for issue tracking.  
   * Twiki maintainers need to let osg-webmaster know of issues.
   * Add Kevin Munday to osg-webmaster?  
   * Should we submit a ticket to GOC for everything for Xeno Media?  MT thinks no, but we need to make sure GOC knows when there is/will be a web outage.   Note from JN:  How?

minutes:
   * ok with goc folks, yes.  Means just cc goc@... on emails, and tell them when it's resolved and what solution is. For website and twiki.
   * Kevin still hasn't responded about being on webmaster list, probably not.  Continuing purchase order? Yes says MT.
   * Thought about communic list, probably don't need cause osg-webmaster has all right people -- web, twiki, etc.  Maybe best to leave K off.

   * AH and RP to write for newsletter (then also for Getting started page in website) "what does it take to join OSG?"
   * Can we track how many hits we get to given twiki pages?  How many people hit the very top twiki page? If enough, we could add a section on "techy news", and advertize it in the newsletter.  MT to ask Kyle
