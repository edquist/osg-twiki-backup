---+ Documentation Project meeting agenda/minutes 12 Jun 07
Attending: 

---++ Things that have come up
   * Gabriele: "VOServices provides an infrastructure for user registration and access authorization on the OSG" ; Ruth: " at the moment it is !Identification/Authorization/Policy ... in the end I come down on renaming PolicyPublicationTrust to whatever Gabriele, Kyle and Anne agree on as the web"

---++ Marcia
   * generate the membership page automatically when there are new physical  institutions that appear in the registration %BLUE% they'll give marcia the info she needs to email new member and get info to post.%ENDCOLOR%  Status?
   * MonaLisa graph needs to be replaced (on "What is OSG" page). ML is deprecated and not  showing accurate information. MT is merging that page with http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About.  Status?

---++ Craig
   * Agreed to work on certificate doc; tentative deadline late July, I think I said  (Alain R says: "updated its CA certificate distribution to reflect 
the contents of the IGTF 1.14 distribution." AH has email with ref URLS, but doesn't know significance of this. Craig to follow-up please.)

---++ Forrest
   * Need expert review of GridUsersGuide to answer AH's red questions
   * Technical problem with twiki attachments: status?
   * "Started a new way so that readers could put in their own parameters and have them instead of our grid school ones. Unfortunately, that is what created the TWiki problem" (no reply yet from twiki community?)
   * (Condensed instruction materials available at [[Documentation/InstallingOsgClient]]. There are still links to [[ReleaseDocumentation/ClientInstallationGuide]]. What's difference?  Which should be used? done as root or nonroot?
   * update on twiki and skin
   * edu doc?  AH had asked FC to create stable link for users to access latest training doc in education twiki. Status?
   * certif installation -- how does this compare with what's in CE install guide? (see prev mtg minutes for more cert issues) Status?
   * Forrest and Chris: update on app porting; (from last meeting ETA:  end of June)  Where in twiki is it going?

---++ Chris
   * Site Test Summary pages: up and running?  Linked to from where? under the VO twiki? VORS?
   * Any doc for this (requested by Ruth)?

---++ Anne
   * in FAQ: MonaLisa deprecated. What to replace "What is ML" with?  Gratia? "how do I monitor my usage?" (from Mats Rynge)
   * FAQ main page needs updating (has all my notes)
   * from my Gums page review:
      * Is this [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/][priv proj site]] still maintained? 
      * Is the [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_config_gums.html][bnl site]] still maintained? 
      * pacman -get ITB:gums <-- should be OSG:gums
      * Uses VDT link for getting GSI certs -- we need to consolidate the cert info. (handed to Craig)
      * There's a comment: gums.config needs to be maintained to include mappings for all active VOs in OSG - has this been remedied? how?
      * Bad link: OSG CE Authorization

---++ CE install guide
   * AH created [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]["streamlined" guide for root install, Condor, full priv, no SE]]; still needs work, testing (not sure about firewall stuff; is Monalisa going away?). 
   * Problem with my making the docs under ITB_0_5?
   * *need review* of [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]] -- Forrest, can you try?
      * haven't tested full privilege -- confirmed CE-PRIMA communication, that's all
      * haven't done WN, globus web services, monalisa, site verify
      * need to extend to any job manager (currently just for condor)

   * Need another common scenario to streamline -- JW says use gridmap instead of full priv
   * Need to go through UNL's guide to compare

---++ Old Links in twiki
   * clean up all old links in twiki -- we should each take a few pages each time.
