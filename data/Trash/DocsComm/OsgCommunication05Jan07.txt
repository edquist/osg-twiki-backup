AH to attend integration meeting Thurs to get feedback.

MT is backup to MH to posting items, and will do that; JN will add reviewing this to her daily routine. %BR%
MT to list all pages that need to be checked: home page, news page. (see WebBestPractices)

[[CommArticlePlanning#IsgTw][List of Planned iSGTW articles]]

---++ News items

news from osg:
press releases, res highlights, any big osg news

how to separate sections on news page, where to put osg newsletter -- think of suggstions

do google alert -- rotate week to week. %BR%
Ah to start next week, followed by JN, followed by MT, then AH again. (alpha by first name or last name. wow!)
---++ DocDB

JN review the categories, make a few changes

---++ "On the plate"
   * Look at new [[CommMtgTemplate][meeting agenda template]]. What to add/change?
   * Set up reservation for future meetings -- or use Gizmo?  AH is installing Gizmo.
      * MT to set up a few weeks of meeting place (through esnet), then can try gizmo or other
      * JN: quarante-et- un - vingt-deux-767-0718 (w), 41-vingt-deux-328-2527 (m)
   * boilerplate OSG citation for scientific publications
   * Anne needs to get contacts -- needs to start getting articles for isgtw from other grid projects.
   * Ideas for collaborative calendar?  Don't need one, put dates on todo lists -- can be weekly. 
   * Can put one in plone -- do we want to use plone? Hold off on plone
   * Awaiting definitions of "member", "partner" from exec bd -- AH checks
   * Searching for news -- should we rotate this responsibility? yes we'll rotate
   * We want to include all scientific pubs in the OSG docdb. To find articles that scientists are publishing using data run through OSG, put notice in newsletter? Send out email? What did we decide?  What is keeping us from doing it?  Draft of email sent to EB, seems to be forgotten.  And how do we list them?  Ruth has ideas.  Wait for boilerplate, then MT to follow up with EB (also with reference format that we'll use).
