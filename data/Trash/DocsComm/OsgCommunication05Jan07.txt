---+ OSG Communications weekly Meeting Agenda and Minutes 5 Jan 2007

Attending:  AH, MT, JN 

---++ OSG newsletter
[[CommArticlePlanning#NewsLetter][List of Planned Newsletter articles]]

Ruth suggests "report on the Copenhagen Information Services meeting from  
Anda anda at cse.usf.edu, Steve Timm and Shaowen. Anda has sent me a  
report you can copy/paste from."  

MT to do?

Marcia wrote [[NewsletterPublicationSteps][instructions for newsletter publication]]. Let's go through the process together, and add more details to the instructions.

AH to attend integration meeting Thurs to get feedback.

---++ Web site review
[[ReviewProcess][Review Process Page]]

The review process tables don't have space for saying "done by xyz on date xyz".  How do we keep track of what's been done?  For instance, Marcia did a lot of reviewing this week, but I don't know which pages. (The auto emails don't do the trick!)

---++ Research Highlights
[[CommArticlePlanning#ResHigh][List of Planned Research Highlights]]

---++ iSGTW Contributions
[[CommArticlePlanning#IsgTw][List of Planned iSGTW articles]]

---++ News items

---++ DocDB

---++ "On the plate"
   * Look at new [[CommMtgTemplate][meeting agenda template]]. What to add/change?
   * Set up reservation for future meetings -- or use Gizmo?  AH is installing Gizmo.
   * boilerplate OSG citation for scientific publications
   * Anne needs to get contacts -- needs to start getting articles for isgtw from other grid projects.
   * Ideas for collaborative calendar?  Can put one in plone -- do we want to use plone?
   * Awaiting definitions of "member", "partner" from exec bd
   * Searching for news -- should we rotate this responsibility?
   * We want to include all scientific pubs in the OSG docdb. To find articles that scientists are publishing using data run through OSG, put notice in newsletter? Send out email? What did we decide?  What is keeping us from doing it?
