---++ General

   * Meet JP Navarro Tues afternoon (or Wed p.m.)
Talk about VDT and software. how the merge and cooperation is going. How much TG is using the VDT base and/or build and test. *This is hopefully an iSGTW and OSG article.*  

From Alain: OSG and TG aligned on same version of Globus for CE node install.  Big accomplishment because: TG had new features, OSG had other patches, had to make it work together.  Have not yet aligned on environment, common GIP standards, etc.

Nanohub is submitting to both; using condor-G.

      * Collaboration and cooperation between TeraGrid and OSG -- how does he see it going? what needs to happen? what is he waiting for from OSG?
      * RP thinks we should put some interoperation activities into the Year 2 plan -- technical and communications, both for others and for you. Any sound bytes you get for this would be good.
