---+ Communications mtg 17 Nov 06

---++ From Anne
   * MT and I met with RP last Fri afternoon.  Unresolved issues from that:
      * ask Kevin about ticker tape for news items on home page. 

MT/AH to ask Ruth: what should home page do -- wants map and wants science.  willing to give up some science real estate?  Will page get too busy? MT to email Kevin.  Under news and events have next flyout be next consort mtg, or reduce science text.  Ask Kevin for ideas about how to incorporate the news, consort meeting item.

      * MT reformatted images on research highlights page -- comments?

KY suggests small images, almost like thumbnails. KY thinks the page should just grow; shows scientific use.  Put date with them (mon and yr)   MT or MH to do

      * AH reworked Getting Started page; MT commented. Jen commented on orig; my changes did not modularize it; is that what it needs?  AH to do.

KY: old site just had links to the info, move more info up. modularize
      * Grid Arch page needs reworking (AH?)

      * MT working on reference docs page; "program of work" doc and others will be accessed directly from docdb. Status?

Haven't worked on it yet. Ruth wants auto update of ref doc, needs scripting.  MT to learn; timescale is... by Xmas.  Hope to start in next couple of weeks. In meantime, put ref docs on docdb home page.

      * animations wanted; to see the old flash animation go to http://home.fnal.gov/aheavey/images/grid_animation.swf; text needs revising. SHould I see if I can get source from Kyle Romberg? Was 2 or 3 yrs ago...  Text should say this is arch for OSG ; not generalize to other grids. AH to ask Kyle Romberg. Jen to forward me his email addrss %BLUE%AH sent mail to kyle 17nov%ENDCOLOR%

      * publish OSG newsletter every two weeks; can be less formal (look at LCG's for example, http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/LCGnews/LCGSepOct06.pdf -- It's HUGE!  Maybe she meant the bulletin https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/LcgBulletins, billed as "what everyone should know", and appears every two weeks); brainstorming meeting Dec 18 in FCC (AH and MT to plan meeting?)

Ask R what she wants it to do. Just say whats going on; leave off scientific?  KY suggests doing survey -- is current OSG helpful, widely read? what info are they looking for?  Right now 2 audiences: collab and external.

      * need brochure with int'l and interoperability focus for RP's "grids in China" talk Dec 7 (let's talk about where to get this info... I've started notes below)

Leigh G knows. what's working and what's not. Where is talk and to whom?

      * prioritize web pages for review  (Jen reviewed, need content experts? who else to review)


   * Jen reviewed website; sent comments.
      * Did you check all links? This needs to be done...
      * Is there pattern of always opening links in same page? What is reason?
      * On the partners page, could there be a more clear definition of a partner?  
      * What IS grid computing -- need def; Katie, can you find what you wrote?
      * move KY's 2 articles up... which articles?
      * Ha! I purposely moved the glossary DOWN --maybe it was a mistake. Please say what made you want to see it, maybe I've got motivation wrong.
      * ahh - let's just look at your email...

AH to move glossary up to about the osg. %BR%
KY to write "what is grid" short and sweet. %BR%
Move up KY's articles. %BR%
Outreach -- need explan. (AH) %BR%
MT check on publications page status (need to solicit these) %BR%
News: %BR%
MT to: Change "breaking news" to "News from OSG", "in the news" as is, Where has osg been mentioned in external publications, remove lines from  %BR%
MT or MH to add consort mtg to mts and events.

Jen to write draft of GADU research highlight for OSG news, etc.

Discovered funny bug when widen/narrow browser window in Firefox: all but the top orange nav bars drag a bit before snapping into place. MT to alert KM.

MT made http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/ReviewProcess %BR%
KY -- add "responsible person" for who does updates %BR%
Give wbmaster task to review quarterly and ping resp persons

Ruth wants list of pages to be reviewed for particular,  need to clarify.  Try for mtg with R Mon or Tues a.m.,  about 10:30 fnal time. Tues is best.

Need webmaster would actively review pages periodically, organize the schedule, make changes, assign changes. Responsibility of 

---++ From last week:
   * Progress on grid cookbook and contacting Mike W and Paul A?  Did MT call?
MT will call MIke.

   * next newsletter -- status? spotlight on Horst done (VDT is NOT news)
almost ready to go (MT), SC06 wrapup not there. MT to put up Ruth's letter, add link to sc06 materials area.  GLExec, Atlas.  Maybe put sc06 wrapup in Dec.  MT to send out version today Fri 17 nov.

   * KY launched iSGTW -- congratulations!  NOw for next week...
   * CDF research highlight: in process of scheduling interviews for wk after Tgiving

---++ Notes about Interoperability (more like Anne's ramblings, so far; don't bother with till I pare down):

   * Thinking about back side of brochure for international/interoperability
      * OSG: The OSG works actively with partners, including grid and network organizations and international, national, regional and campus grids, to create a grid infrastructure that spans the globe.
      * EGEE and wLCG:
[[http://www.eu-egee.org/]] The Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project brings together scientists and engineers from more than 90 institutions in 32 countries world-wide to provide a seamless Grid infrastructure for e-Science that is available to scientists 24 hours-a-day.

[[http://info.web.cern.ch/Press/PressReleases/Releases2005/PR06.05E.html]] The goal of LHC computing is to use a world-wide grid infrastructure of computing centres to provide sufficient computational, storage and network resources to fully exploit the scientific potential of the four major LHC experiments: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. The infrastructure relies on several national and regional science grids. The service challenge used resources from the LHC Computing Grid (LCG) project, the Enabling Grids for E-SciencE (EGEE) project, Grid3/Open Science Grid (OSG), INFNGrid and GridPP.
      * NorduGrid deploys ARC, not VDT. It has no US sites. It's not part of EGEE. How do OSG and NorduGrid interoperate?
      * ASGC (Academia Sinica Grid Computing) participates in LCG 3D &#8220;Distributed Deployment of Databases for LCG&#8221;; part of service definition and implementation workgroup, and also participate in CA/Oracle authentication study.
      * TeraGrid: I see no ref on their site to OSG; there is ref to some institutions that are part of OSG (UCSD, IU, UofC). Shaowen Wang did presentation in 2005 about OSG-TeraGrid interop: http://grow.uiowa.edu/education/meetings/Blutprint_OSG-TG_Shaowen.pdf (pretty terse)


http://osg.ivdgl.org/pub/InformationServices/Documentation.WebHome/OSG-IS-Plan-v0.9.2.pdf %BR%
Service discovery interfaces and definition address service discovery on OSG,
which also takes the interoperability with EGEE into preliminary consideration.

Definition of the GLUE Schema [2] v1.3 is a joint activity among several largescale
Grids with OSG included to enhance the GLUE Schema 1.2. Specifically,
this activity reflects the interest of OSG to continue to promote the
interoperability with peer Grids.

Information services interoperability with peer Grids such as EGEE, NorduGrid,
and TeraGrid is necessary for OSG to achieve interoperation with these Grids.

The Open Science Grid (OSG) GIP (OSG-GIP) has been developed to enable
LCG-OSG interoperability, OSG resource selection services, GridCat, etc. The
GIP is a grid information service that aggregates static and dynamic resource
information for use with LDAP-based information systems such as the BDII. The
GIP produces information based on the GLUE Schema.

The goal of interoperable information services: To support VOs for their end-to-end interoperability use cases that access OSG common
services.

Several methods have been investigated to achieve interoperable information services,
which include
1. deployment of common information services (e.g., BDII and GIP for LCG and
OSG) and standards (e.g., the GLUE Schema) among different Grids,
2. development and deployment of bridging information services (e.g., a translator
service) between Grids,
3. the migration of the current Grid infrastructures to a Service Oriented
Architecture.

In addition to information services, other services that have been considered to support
Grid interoperation include Security (Authentication / Authorization / Accounting /
Auditing), Data Storage (catalogues, storage interface, data transfer), and Job
Management (submission, monitoring, resource selection, scheduling). Also, there are
VO-specific services that may require interoperability validations, as their configuration
might be different on different Grids.

our twiki: There has been a lot of progress on Interoperability with the EGEE and WLCG projects. The deployment of a common Information System based on the BDII and Glue Schema and the development and deployment of Information Providers for the OSG are now available for installation on OSG Compute and Storage Elements. 

Where does GGF and GRIP fit in?
GRid Interoperability Project (GRIP): An interoperability layer will be created that will allow clients from a UNICORE Grid to access resources wholly within a Grid controlled by Globus. The GRIP developers will work with the Globus team at ANL to implement this interoperability layer, with respect to transfer of resource management and security across the boundaries of the different Grids.

[[http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/information_technology/report-25023.html]] In the United States, a toolkit has been developed, called Globus, that enables application developers and middleware developers to use the Grid, and its resources, in a consistent way. "You can visualise this as a kind of horizontal approach," adds Erwin, "which covers the areas that have to be addressed. It provides application programming interfaces [APIs] to high-level services that will make use of Globus program calls."

Part of the original GRIP plan included work to make UNICORE resources available from Globus, i.e. in the reverse direction. "This was an entirely logical and consistent objective, but then events overtook us," comments Erwin. "The Global Grid Forum started work on the definition of OGSA (Open Grid Service Architecture), so it became much more important to focus our resources on interoperability between UNICORE and Globus Toolkit 3. The latter is essentially Globus with an OGSA wrapper around it...


Draft text (don't read yet, please! not ready!):

The OSG works actively with partners, including grid and network organizations and international, national, regional and campus grids, to create a grid infrastructure that spans the globe.  OSG has established computing sites in the U.K., South Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil in addition to its sites throughout the U.S.

The OSG and the European grid project Enabling Grids for E-SciencE (EGEE) use the same middleware infrastructure, the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT), thus facilitating interoperability.  Both OSG and EGEE are partners with the worldwide LHC Computing Grid (wLCG). Academia Sinica Grid Computing (ASGC) participates in the wLCG's Distributed Deployment of Databases for LCG (LCG 3D), and thus is an OSG partner.
