---++ From Anne
   * MT and I met with RP last Fri afternoon.  Unresolved issues from that:
      * ask Kevin about ticker tape for news items on home page
      * MT reformatted images on research highlights page -- comments?
      * AH reworked Getting Started page; MT commented. Others?
      * Grid Arch page needs reworking
      * MT working on reference docs page; "program of work" doc and others will be accessed directly from docdb. Status?
      * animations wanted; to see the old flash animation go to http://home.fnal.gov/aheavey/images/grid_animation.swf; text needs revising
      * publish OSG newsletter every two weeks; can be less formal (look at LCG's for example, http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/LCGnews/LCGSepOct06.pdf -- It's HUGE!  Maybe she meant the bulletin https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/LcgBulletins, billed as "what everyone should know", and appears every two weeks); brainstorming meeting Dec 18 in FCC (AH and MT to plan meeting?)
      * need brochure with int'l and interoperability focus for RP's "grids in China" talk Dec 7 (let's talk about where to get this info...
      * prioritize web pages for review  (Jen reviewed, need content experts? who else to review)

   * Jen reviewed website; sent comments.
      * Did you check all links? Should get done...

   * Progress on grid cookbook and contacting MW and PA?

   * Ideas for back side of brochure for international/interoperability
      * EGEE and wLCG:
[[http://www.eu-egee.org/]] The Enabling Grids for E-sciencE project brings together scientists and engineers from more than 90 institutions in 32 countries world-wide to provide a seamless Grid infrastructure for e-Science that is available to scientists 24 hours-a-day.

[[http://info.web.cern.ch/Press/PressReleases/Releases2005/PR06.05E.html]] The goal of LHC computing is to use a world-wide grid infrastructure of computing centres to provide sufficient computational, storage and network resources to fully exploit the scientific potential of the four major LHC experiments: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. The infrastructure relies on several national and regional science grids. The service challenge used resources from the LHC Computing Grid (LCG) project, the Enabling Grids for E-SciencE (EGEE) project, Grid3/Open Science Grid (OSG), INFNGrid and GridPP.
      * NorduGrid deploys ARC, not VDT. It has no US sites. It's not part of EGEE. How do OSG and NorduGrid interoperate?
      * ASGC (Academia Sinica Grid Computing) participates in LCG 3D &#8220;Distributed Deployment of Databases for LCG&#8221;; part of service definition and implementation workgroup, and also participate in CA/Oracle authentication study.
      * TeraGrid: I see no ref on their site to OSG; there is ref to some institutions that are part of OSG (UCSD, IU, UofC)
