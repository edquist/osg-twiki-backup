---++ From Anne
   * MT and I met with RP last Fri afternoon.  Unresolved issues from that:
      * ask Kevin about ticker tape for news items on home page
      * MT reformatted images on research highlights page -- comments?
      * AH reworked Getting STarted page; MT commented. Others?
      * Grid Arch page needs reworking
      * MT working on reference docs page; "program of work" doc and others will be accessed directly from docdb. Status?
      * animations wanted.
      * publish OSG newsletter every two weeks; can be less formal (look at LCG's for example); brainstorming meeting Dec 18 in FCC
      * need brochure with int'l and interoperability focus for RP's "grids in China" talk Dec 7
      * prioritize web pages for review  (Jen reviewed, need content experts? who else to review)

   * Jen reviewed website; sent comments.
      * Did you check all links? Should get done...

   * Progress on grid cookbook and contacting MW and PA?
