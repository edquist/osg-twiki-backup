---+ Documentation Project meeting agenda/minutes 29 May 07
Attending: FC, AH, MT

---++ Things that have come up

---++ With Marcia
   * "Could you talk to Kyle and Rob about how you might generate the membership page automatically when there are new physical  institutions that appear in the registration?" from Ruth
      * Sounds like there's manual intervention involved -- how to handle?
   * we can restrict !DocsComm, just need to make it clear on twiki home page and left nav bar (Marcia to do)  (use allowwebview, then set web to be private)  member of griduser or admin group, can see, 
Decision: Let's set top level with robots, and everything below should be restricted too.
   * there was something else that Ruth mentioned...

---++ Forrest
   * update on twiki and skin, test environment
   * update on user doc 
   * update on CE client install as nonroot (KG had successfully installed as nonroot)
   * certif installation -- how does this compare with what's in CE install guide? 
   * update on app porting;  ETA:  end of June
   * doc on [[Sandbox/ForrestChristianSandboxTesting]]
   * [[Sandbox/ForrestChristianCanIRun]]
   
---++ Chris
   * update on Site Test Summary pages: user-support.opensc... domain hosted by fnal, run out of afs space; 
   * Still true?  CG will make web site available under the VO twiki; maybe a link from VORS (too soon to tell)

---++ Anne
   * need review of [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]]
   * haven't tested full privilege -- confirmed CE-PRIMA communication, that's all
   * haven't done WN, globus web services, monalisa, site verify
   * need to extend to any job manager (currently just for condor)

---++ CE install guide
   * AH created [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE]["streamlined" guide for root install, Condor, full priv, no SE]]; still needs work, testing (not sure about firewall stuff; is Monalisa going away?). 
   * Need another common scenario to streamline -- JW says use gridmap instead of full priv
   * Need to go through UNL's guide to compare

---++ Old Links in twiki
   * clean up all old links in twiki -- we should each take a few pages each time.
