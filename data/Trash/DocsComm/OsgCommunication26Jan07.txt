---++ Metrics pages

Based on gratia output what info is useful to pull out, wants it under monitoring under tools for collaborators, get kevin involved for formatting. Philippe has cron job with output to put in afs space.  What do we want?
OUtput is just text.  Next step: examine output, decide what we want, ask him to put the desired info into a web page. Eventually, rP wants nice diagram (like ribbon diagram).  Get John U involved for that part.

MT to contact Philippe

---++ News items
MT: grid today press release from Jen, written by new OSG person (LONI). It appears that we had input, so it's on home page, posted it in "news from osg" and asked for graphic (got email from ruth with contact info).

MT to subscribe JN to osg-webmaster.

Anything specifically about OSG can go on home page.  Look for contact info in any press release that we find.

AH wants to consolidate the two news pages; it's confusing.
