   * AH proposes the following text to provide for researchers using OSG resources (I looked at the astrogrid link to get ideas):

When you make use of Open Science Grid resources, services or tools, we would be grateful to have you acknowledge this use in any resulting publications. We suggest the following or similar text:

"This research has made use of software or computing resources provided 
by the Open Science Grid, which is supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science"

   * discuss job postings page (rq email of 1/5/07):
"While troubleshooting some problems this afternoon at Hampton  
University I was on the phone with Ken McFarlan. He mentioned that  
Lawrence Sorrillo, the previous site admin had left Hampton, and  
wondered if there was a job posting page for OSG jobs, as he is  
looking for a replacement. I told him that I have not seen such a  
page, but it sounded like an excellent idea. Do you know if there is  
anything, or if one is planned? If it has not been discussed, I think  
it is worth looking into."
