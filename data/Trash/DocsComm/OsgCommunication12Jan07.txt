---+ OSG Communications weekly Meeting Agenda and Minutes 12 Jan 2007

Attending:  AH, MT, JN %BLUE%(adjust by week)%ENDCOLOR%

---++ OSG newsletter
[[CommArticlePlanning#NewsLetter][List of Planned Newsletter articles]]
   * do we ping Ruth weekly for OSG news?   MT to take
   * AH to report on feedback so far -- look at GEON, SDSC short
   * mailing lists associated with newsletter -- is: osgnews

---++ Poster for SciDAC PI Meeting  Feb 5-6 
[[http://outreach.scidac.gov/kickoff/ ][Meeting web site]]

Ruth asked for this -- a resource center or a scientist?  2 sessions. find out.
8' by 4' BIG! or several smaller ones  ; talk to Fred about costs 

osg funded partly by scidac, pi's of other projects -- know computing, but not necessarily grid computing.

---++ Web site review
[[ReviewProcess][Review Process Page]]
   * MT to report on progress
       * rp to look at council page
       * mailing lists page -- MT to look at, look through listserv
   * AH proposes to consolidate contacts and media contacts pages -ok
   * AH proposes the following text to provide for researchers using OSG resources (I looked at the astrogrid link to get ideas):

When you make use of Open Science Grid resources, services or tools, we would be grateful to have you acknowledge this use in any resulting publications. We suggest the following or similar text:

"This research has made use of (software or computing) resources provided 
by the Open Science Grid, which is supported by the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science"

ky thinks is fine, maybe get rid of sw or comp.

   * discuss job postings page (rq email of 1/5/07):
"While troubleshooting some problems this afternoon at Hampton  
University I was on the phone with Ken McFarlan. He mentioned that  
Lawrence Sorrillo, the previous site admin had left Hampton, and  
wondered if there was a job posting page for OSG jobs, as he is  
looking for a replacement. I told him that I have not seen such a  
page, but it sounded like an excellent idea. Do you know if there is  
anything, or if one is planned? If it has not been discussed, I think  
it is worth looking into."

If put it up, has to be kept current. High maintenance but small job. Ask Ruth.  Send to osg, if no responses, don't make page!
