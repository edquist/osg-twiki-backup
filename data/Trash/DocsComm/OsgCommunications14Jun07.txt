Attending:  AH, MT, JN %BLUE%(adjust by week)%ENDCOLOR%

---++ OSG newsletter
[[CommArticlePlanning#NewsLetter][List of Planned Newsletter articles]]

   * MT and RP talked; wants to change format, RP says people don't read it. wants it simpler, more announcements less stories. Won't change appearance yet -- see how new format works.
   * need to find a profile person; have some announcements
   * AH wants to link to isgtw from newsletter each time

---++ Web site review
[[ReviewProcess][Review Process Page]]
   * JN: I could review and suggest a mini-reorg of New/Events pages. MT and AH both think this is good idea!
   * AH to look at About the OSG structure to respond to Chander's concerns
   * discussing possible changes to home page -- right hand image not space well used. AH suggests calendar plus maybe something bigger from isgtw. MT doesn't like idea. Nor does JN.
   * If you don't know what isgtw is, the link doesn't tell you -- people aren't seeing it.
   * How to show osg - isgtw relationship appropriately -- MT and AH will talk to Ruth about

---++ Research Highlights
[[CommArticlePlanning#ResHigh][List of Planned Research Highlights]]

Marcia's doing interviews and article on Rio Grande  (Brownsville) grid school -- status? (not sure if it'll go just in newsletter, or in isgtw, in any case will be good for web site and to give to NSF)

---++ iSGTW Contributions
[[CommArticlePlanning#IsgTw][List of Planned iSGTW articles]]

OSG responsible for 1 article a month; due the 14th of each month -- nice and regular.  Upcoming (not written in stone):

   * July: OSG-TG interoperability
   * Aug: user workshop (July meeting) (or maybe MT's school article)
   * Sept: campus ci days
   * Oct: great plains network

Now -- besides the OSG stuff, there's room for another U.S. story once/month, plus an opinion piece. So we can contribute MORE!!
