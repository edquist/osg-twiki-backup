   * Next meeting: talk to Chris/Abishek about VORS VO urls and VO web links 

---+++ Updates of VO web for Ops and Atlas
   * schedule?
Tim: will make some progress in next couple of weeks

John (sent email): I am in the process of establishing the
right group of people to get the information needed to update the ATLAS
VO information. 

---+++ CE install guide test on JW test server
   * status?
Forrest -- haven't done yet; see how urgent it is, what prompted it -- take offline

---+++ Look and feel of doc twiki
   * status?
Forrest: nothing yet in production, implement first on dev twiki, then move to test twiki on cmssrv09...8443, then when EB signs off, move to prod; now: testing on pattern skin.

   * search function from Abishek: Please see the Edge Services twiki (towards the bottom of the 
page) - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/EdgeServices/WebHome

<verbatim>
<table align=right bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><tr valign="top"><td></td>
<td width="150" align="left" valign="top">
<form action="http://www.google.com/search" method="get">
<input type="hidden" name="sitesearch" value="twiki.grid.iu.edu">
<input type="hidden" name="q" value="+site:+twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/EdgeServices">
<input type="text" name="q" size="18" /><br /><input type="submit" value="Search ESF" /><br /> 
<font size="-2">Using Google</font>
</form>
</td></tr></table>
</verbatim>

Discussion on search: adv and disadv to both twiki and google searches. Best solution may be to provide both. Jen had asked to hide some twiki pages from google; this goes against.  But individual pages can be hidden with 
<verbatim>
Set ALLOWTOPICVIEW = Main.TWikiAdminGroup, Main.GridGroup
</verbatim>
This will limit viewing your topic to only valid TWiki users who have authenticated. Those people who do not have a TWiki account would not be able to see the topics.

---+++ End user doc
   * AH needs to work on; see "old knowledgebase pages" below
   * Ruth nixed the idea of moving user doc to web site; keep in in twiki
   * Forrest: Ruth asked about status of User Guide that you're working on; https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/GridUsersGuide; most recent edit 01 Feb.

Forrest: what is meant by "user", above doc is complete, but not sufficient. Question about testing for accuracy.
Also: Need to know how to create/port app, the JDL, how to run app. Where, what are auth's, can my app get what it needs, etc. 

Forrest sent email post-meeting: I have started documenting what it will take to run a job on the OSG. See:
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianSandboxTesting
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianCanIRun
I think that the Porting The Application, which EGEE covers to great extent
in their documentation, is what we are missing.

---+++ VORS VO urls and VO !WebHome links
   * Talk with Chris G and Abishek
   * Want to point users to VO sites and to VO/WebHome for links to those sites and/or actual info provided by VO
   * as first pass, should we point to VORS VO links from !VO/WebHome?

CG: not necessarily -- different objective in VORS (getting registered); no pattern to the URLs; better to ask the VO contacts (get from GOC)

   * identify and approach VO liaisons for end users  (AH to do; KG sent me url with names)
   * help users find accurate site information -- Is their VO supported? Does their app run?
   * what are VOs asking for?  What do their users need?
   * (nixed) possible action item: go through some of these VO urls, see if easy to navigate to instructions; if not, notify VO responsible person

---++ Old knowledgebase pages from early '06
   * I have original text for each one
   * Which are relevant and can be used?
   * Which need updating?
   * What are other general topics that users would find helpful?
   * Some have already been transferred to the twiki by me last fall (I'll have to look at my records to see which ones)
   * Craig -- what do you plan to have your writers work on relative to this type of thing?  Can they start from these topics?

CP: Haven't hired yet, will be engineering students involved in all aspects of OSG. Write "how stuff works" articles, _empowering stories_,  e.g., "how does PKI work in context of grids"

   * Possible action item: AH, CP (interested in contextual doc) and CG (user liaison)  to go through topics, organize by user type or admin type, then check contents to see if need updating; get each page reviewed by expert
