---+ Planning for coordinated effort between documentation and education

---++ Four areas of documentation that need attention
   * Integration, release doc
   * Doc and edu pages coordination
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-specific info
   * Documentation hub and pages to which its spokes point (needs to point appropriately to above three areas)

This page concentrates on the second bullet item.  The fourth item is also involved to an extent.

---++ Doc and edu pages coordination: who's involved
Needed for Chander's yr 2 spreadsheet

   * Anne H - .35 FTE for doc -- total (including all four above bullet points)
      * principal coordinator for doc hub
      * help integration activity with reorganization of release doc for 0.8.0
      * 
   * Forrest C - ~100 hrs remaining till Sept
      * application porting doc (w/ Chris G), update FAQ, 
   * Ben C - ?FTE?
      * provide end user education tutorials
   * Alina B - 1.0 FTE?
      * coordinate education materials
   * Siddhartha E-S - 0.5 FTE (for combination of EOT and doc; 20 hr/wk during school yr)
      * consolidate certificate info
      * provide sysadmin education tutorials and materials 
   
---++ What are goals for OSG doc?

   * Identify all types of audiences
   * Identify pieces of info each audience needs, and in what order.
   * Make sure doc hub is easily navigable for each type of audience, with each piece of info in the right order
   * Have one and only one page on which a particular thing is documented; eliminate redundancy
   * Make it easy to transition doc from one OSG release to the next.

---++ What are goals for Edu doc?
   * Formulate tutorials so that they can be leveraged for real users and admins
      * Issue: the steps only work when you're sitting in the workshop. Can we have an appropriately-secured, sandbox-type resource that can be accessed by anybody who wants to go through the tutorials? (MW 7/16: yes, and we're not that far from it)
 I.e., Engagement users, new small VOs, etc.  
   * What is difference between sysadmin tutorial and plain sysadmin instructions? Can they be the same?  MW and AH think yes.
      * This requires coordination between integration, docs and EOT.
   * Admin tutorials are in early planning stages; what scenarios will/should these tutorials cover? 
      * CE Install: for starting doc, use [[Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE][OSG CE 0.6.n Installation Instructions, Install as root, use Condor, do not have an SE]] which takes you through one scenario (lite-weight, can throw away), you don't have to make many choices;  Siddhartha's job would be: improve on this doc, then present the other options (e.g., job managers, privilege options, and so on), and provide/point to good instructions for those options.
      * Improve full-fledged CE install instructions to work for "tutorial graduates" and any other sysadmin.
      * What about VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, GUMS, etc. admins?
   * Mike suggests: have student provide own resources (or maybe we provide virtual machines)


MW: in grid school, 1/2 day to introduce: need quick path through doc to get first site working; condense the experience of initial install
Don't want lots of extra tutorial info that 
---++ Outstanding questions
   * How much of Siddhartha's time will be dedicated to OSG doc and OSG Edu doc?

PA: Craig and Paul agreed: 25% on docs and 75% EOT; in fall he'll be 20 hr/wk; summer 40 hr/wk; he'll help w workshops %BR%
MW: let's just identify deliverables, don't try to figure out %. Siddhartha will try to enhance sysadmin edu doc; %BR%
AH: first priority for S. is sysadmin doc; move cert info to 2nd priority

   * What "standard doc" pages would education like to refer back to?  The tutorials should introduce new users to the "real" documentation.
   * Does Engagement have special needs?
   * Can Paul come to Aug 1 meeting in Chicago area? yes

---++ Action items
   * Go through docinventory.xls spreadsheet which lists audiences and required/desired documents (map of all documentation)
   * Coordinate with audiences in rel_doc_twikis.xls which lists release documentation pages, tries to order them and correlate them with appropriate audiences (map of release documentation)
   * (AH proposes a meeting prior to Aug 1 with AH, MW, RG (?) to discuss, coordinate and update the two aforementioned spreadsheets)
   * Organize Aug 1 meeting:
      * Ask Ruth for strawman agenda
         * review edu materials [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Education/RioGrandeGridSchool2007Syllabus]]
      * Revise/enhance agenda
      * Invite people
      * Create materials needed for meeting (e.g., twiki pages, spreadsheets...)
   * Siddhartha to go through [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_5/AH_CEInstallGuideRootCondorNoSE][streamlined CE install guide]] ahead of time (arrive 7/29, stay through 8/2)
