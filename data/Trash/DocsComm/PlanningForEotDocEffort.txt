---+ Planning for coordinated effort between documentation and education

---++ Four areas of documentation that need attention
   * Integration, release doc
   * Doc and edu pages coordination
   * VO-specific info
   * Documentation hub and pages to which its spokes point (needs to point appropriately to above three areas) 
This page concentrates on the third bullet item.  The fourth item is also involved to an extent.

---++ Doc and edu pages coordination: who's involved

   * Anne H - .35 FTE for doc -- total (including all four above bullet points)
      * principal coordinator for doc hub
      * help integration activity with reorganization of release doc for 0.8.0
      * 
   * Forrest C - ~100 hrs remaining till Sept
   * Ben C - ?FTE?
      * provide end user education tutorials
   * Alina B - 1.0 FTE?
      * coordinate education materials
   * Siddhartha E-S - ?FTE?
      * consolidate certificate info
      * provide sysadmin education tutorials and materials
   
---++ What are goals for doc?

   * Identify all types of audiences
   * Identify pieces of info each audience needs, and in what order.
   * Make sure doc hub is easily navigable for each type of audience, with each piece of info in the right order
   * Have one and only one page on which a particular thing is documented; eliminate redundancy
   * Make it easy to transition doc from one OSG release to the next.

---++ Outstanding questions
   * How to formulate tutorials so that they can be leveraged for real users and admins
      * Issue: the steps only work when you're sitting in the workshop. Can we have an appropriately-secured, sandbox-type resource that can be accessed by anybody who wants to go through the tutorials?  I.e., Engagement users, new small VOs, etc.
   * Admin tutorials are in early planning stages; what scenarios will/should these tutorials cover?
   * How much of Siddhartha's time will be dedicated to OSG doc and OSG Edu doc?
   * What "standard doc" pages would education like to refer back to?  The tutorials should introduce new users to the "real" documentation.
   * Does Engagement have special needs?
