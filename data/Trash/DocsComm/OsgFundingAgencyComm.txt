---++ Provide "Nuggets" to NSF
"Your approved nugget is one of several elements used by the Advisory Committee for GPRA Performance Assessment (AC/GPA) in its annual effort to determine significant achievement of NSF's program portfolio and the fulfillment of its overall mission.... The outcomes are reflected in the NSF Performance and Accountability Report (PAR), and the Budget Request to OMB. In addition, NSF staff often use the nuggets in developing Congressional testimony.... Nuggets provide the reader with useful information by being  understandable to a non-scientist, demonstrating a notable outcome, and addressing one  or more indicators (objectives) in the Strategic Plan. Images can greatly enhance their usefulness in showing outcomes from your programs, especially in light of their many uses as noted above"  Marvin Goldberg

Do other non-NEES NSF-funded projects use same form and template?  What's the award number, and does it vary from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to VO?

KY says we can use research highlights, modified appropriately (sample nuggets in Anne's email from KY 21 Dec 06)

Question: Is there a call for nuggets in 2006-2007?  Who do I contact?
