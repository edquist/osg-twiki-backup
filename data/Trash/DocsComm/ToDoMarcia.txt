Xeno PO # 579393 - $2100 left as of 3/20/08

   * Outstanding Issues
      * For Xeno: "I can't find what I need button": 3/20 - %RED%Xeno will come up w/ mockup. Not good to have it appear on gray bar; gray bar for things that aren't clickable, things that do things for orange.%ENDCOLOR% MT: Xeno needs to create form in CMS. (Users get prompted for a cert each time they access, the web host is the appropriate place for this.
      * For Xeno: Gray "buttons" are confusing people (many complaints): %RED%Xeno will play with css.  (Using graphical headings will require recoding; changes must happen through CSS!)%ENDCOLOR%
      * Does osg-webmaster cause ticket creation each time? %RED% emailed GOC 3/20%ENDCOLOR%
      * Req to Tilted Planet for permanent test site.  Cost: $35 setup + $35/month + ~ one hour work from Xeno. Email to give go-ahead once req submitted.
      * Need to meet w/ Anne re: Publications
      * Need to meet w/ Anne re: Organization
      * GOC link -- to be removed?

---+++OSG USERS (communication w/ OSG users)  

   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/UserGroup/UserSupportMeetings][User Support Meetings]] Thursday, 1:30PM 


---+++GRAPHICS
   
   * Photos from VMS on bluearc in images\osg\, including mock-up of triangle poses.
   * Anne and Marcia to provide content for Cindy's second poster (what's currently going on with OSG).
   * Anne and Marcia to give Cindy new research highlights for third poster (people and research highlights).
   * "Triangle" captions need to be written as if spoken.  (and clarification needed for whether it needs to be written for community/regional/national or easy/welcoming/...).
   * OSG needs to get pictures of people in poses.

---+++FOR RUTH

   * Clarification needed on newsletter role.
   * Indico needs work; probably need a different tool for overall calendar list and use Indico only for bigger meetings. New version of Twiki has Calendar function; AH will ask Rob Q to try.
   * Clarification needed on User Group role - still part of even though now on "External" Communications?


---+++FOR LATER


---+++DONE/ISSUES RESOLVED

   * Brian B: plots moved to gratia server.  Done: http://gratia.fnal.gov/Files/osg_gratia_display/today/ 
   * For Xeno:  What is cost of having case-insensitive URLS?: %RED%Kevin Munday: "That's not how URLS work"  See NY Times site; everything after the slash is case sensitive!  Would cause a lot of problems with coding; not worth it. %ENDCOLOR%
   * Remove "Home" button?  %RED%KM: not advised; has found that people prefer a button to clicking a logo. %ENDCOLOR%
