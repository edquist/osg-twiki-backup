---++ Understand division of responsibilities GOC and Security

   $ GOC: provides a single point of operational support for the  Open Science Grid (OSG). The GOC performs real time Grid monitoring and problem tracking, provides support to users, developers and systems administrators, maintains grid services, provides security incident response, and maintains information repositories.The GOC provides the OSG Registration Catalog for the Support Centers, Virtual Organizations, and Services. Validation and monitoring tools include: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS, Information Systems, and RSV.

(one time I pulled up goc page, orange nav bar didn't come up; had to refresh; oooh, it's happening more often)

So you go to GOC to answer what questions or accomplish what tasks?
   * select a resource
   * submit a ticket
   * review tickets
   * report an incident
   * find tools to run your own queries
   * join the ops mail list
   * find news on all things "operation"
   * current maintenance
   * register a resource, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo or support center

   $ Security: provide a security framework that enables science and promotes autonomous and open science collaboration among VOs, sites, and software providers.

You go to security to answer what questions or accomplish what tasks?
   * report security incident (directs you to GOC)
   * learn about your security responsibilities
   * get a certificate

---++ Define one clear path from home page
---+++ Urgent Incident reporting (needs work)
Security -> Submit a trouble ticket -> Form on GOC pages

Or are you supposed to call if it's really urgent? Clarify

Edits for Security/IncidentDiscoveryReporting page:
   * too many words
   * either security@... or abuse@... -- pick one and give it to them.
   * list of info to include in email to goc -- get rid of, point to form on GOC pages
   * Remove incident response plan from this page -- wrong audience

---+++ How to get a certificate (ok)
Security -> Get DOEGrids...

Technical Documentation -> Get DOEGrids

---+++ Register a resource, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo or support center (ok)
   * GOC -> Register resource, vo, etc.
   * Documentation -> register resource -> ReleaseDocumentation/RegisterResourceWithGOC -> link to GOC webform
   * Documentation -> register VO --> RegisterWithOsg
   * Documentation -> register support center -> RegisterWithOsg

---++ GOC front page
Make it Short and sweet:

Remove stuff at top -- many eyes think it's a heading and skip it. Go figure.

One SHORT sentence : GOC is... then link to "about the GOC"

Bullet points (links only, point to info on another page):

Contact us:
   * in case of emergency (give instruction, e.g. call, submit ticket, or whatever they're supposed to do)
   * contact phone
   * contact email
   * form to submit trouble ticket

Site/resource status and availability:
   * select grid resources based on your VO (point to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS user doc http://vors.grid.iu.edu/documentation/index.html; add link to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS display from doc page. Also, is it appropriate to point to Chris G's test suite? If not here, where?)
   * (what are other questions VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS can answer?)
   * Find xzy information (what exactly does Monalisa show you? point to it)
   * Why would you check the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS monitor?
   * Run series of site functional tests (site_verify) http://scan.grid.iu.edu/
   * View complete GLUE schema results from LDAP query http://is.grid.iu.edu/
   * link to information systems (points to http://is.grid.iu.edu/, but says nothing about what this is or what it does)
   * run your own tests on resources using provided probes (link to RSV doc http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/) FIX LINK to NEW RSV PAGE

General:
   * register a resource
   * register a VO
   * register a support center
   * join operations mailist
   * recent presentations
   * working documents and files

Remove "recent presentations", put somewhere else; not sure where. Maybe include bullet point for them then put them on separate page.

---++ GOC trouble ticket form
   * add in fields specifically for each type of info you need
   * add in urgency or a check box if it involves security
   * 

Questions:
   * http://www.grid.iu.edu/systems/ Tim Silvers should incorporate all this into the monitoring twiki page; and remove this page.  Or coordinate appropriately. Each piece of info should be in one easy-to-find place.
