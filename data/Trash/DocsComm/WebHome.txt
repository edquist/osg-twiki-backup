%TOC%

---++ Development Objectives and Scope 

The main objectives of the Documentatin activity are to define:
   * what are the areas of OSG requiring documentation, i.e. the different sections that will have distinctly managed web presence
      * Presenting OSG to the public (Xenomedia-crafted website)
         * Communications (news/events, newsletters, research highlights, contacts, and so on)
         * Layperson-friendly descriptions of grid technology used by OSG
      * Information for OSG developers, activity members (twiki, not for public)
      * Information for OSG users, resource admins (twiki, for public)
   * who's responsible for each part
   * what are the technology/tools needs of each
   * review and administrative processes of each
   * time frames
   * both public, and private (non-public sausage making, and operational)
<!--
Of the areas, we decided to concentrate on:

   * OSG consortium pages, plus communications (e.g., OSG newsletter)
   * OSG grid pages 
   * operations pages
-->
 Collaboration pages
   * [[DocsComm.DocumentationActivity][Documentation Activity]] -- [[DocsComm.DocumentationActivity#Meetings][(Doc Activity Meetings)]]
