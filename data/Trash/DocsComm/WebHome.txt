---++ Objectives and Scope: Documentation and Communications Activities
---+++ Documentation
The objectives of the *Documentation* activity are to define and manage:
   * the areas of OSG requiring documentation, i.e. the different sections that will have distinctly managed web presence
   * responsible activities and/or individuals for each part
   * the technology/tools needed for each part
   * the review and administrative processes for each part
   * time frames
   * coordination with activities that require their own documentation (e.g., education, operations)

There are currently the following "web presences" (responsible in parentheses):
   * [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/][OSG web portal]] (communications)
   * [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/][Grid Operations Center]] (operations)
   * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/][OSG collaborative workspace (twiki)]] (different responsible for each web)
   * [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/][Document Repository]] (communications)
   * [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/osgedu/schools/gridlab/][EOT's self-paced grid course]] and other course material on =www.ci.uchicago.edu/osgedu= (EOT).

Technical areas requiring documentation include:
   * Information for OSG developers, activity members (activity webs in twiki, not for public)
   * Operations pages (GOC pages; for all OSG members)
   * Information for OSG users, resource admins (twiki, for public)

---+++ Communications
The *Communications* group is responsible for presenting OSG to the public, thus maintaining the content of the Xenomedia-crafted website. This includes:
   * news/events, newsletters, research highlights, contacts, posters, brochures, images, some outreach activities
   * Layperson-friendly descriptions of OSG and general grid computing concepts
   * this overlaps heavily with the website maintenance listed under "Documentation activity".

---++ Meetings
   * Documentation group meetings have been temporarily suspended as of fall '07; work was being handled in the [[Trash/Trash/Integration/MeetingMinutes][integration meetings]] for the technical doc for 0.8.0.
