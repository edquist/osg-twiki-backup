%TOC%

---++ Objectives and Scope 

The objectives of the Documentation activity are to define and manage:
   * the areas of OSG requiring documentation, i.e. the different sections that will have distinctly managed web presence
   * responsible individuals for each part
   * the technology/tools needed for each part
   * the review and administrative processes for each part
   * time frames
This activity encompasses technical and non-technical documentation; education, training and outreach; the OSG web portal; and the OSG Twiki.

Technical areas requiring documentation include:
   * Information for OSG developers, activity members (twiki, not for public)
   * Operations pages
   * Information for OSG users, resource admins (twiki, for public)
The Documentation Activity manages a project to create and maintain this information.

The communications group is responsible for presenting OSG to the public, thus maintaining the content of the Xenomedia-crafted website. This includes:
   * Communications (news/events, newsletters, research highlights, contacts, and so on)
   * Layperson-friendly descriptions of grid technology used by OSG


<!--
Of the areas, we decided to concentrate on:

   * OSG consortium pages, plus communications (e.g., OSG newsletter)
   * OSG grid pages 
   * operations pages
-->
