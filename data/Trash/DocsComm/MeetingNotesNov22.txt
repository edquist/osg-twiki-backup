---++ OSG.org Defacement



	* On Nov 17, somewhere around 11:15AM CDT, a recently discovered exploit was used to deface the www.opensciencegrid.org website.

	* Shortly thereafter, Fermilab brought the site down, and a backup mambo instance was patched and brought online at IU. All accounts were shut off on mambo and the database passwords were also changed. Fermilab instituted a redirect from www.opensciencegrid.org to osg.grid.iu.edu. Due to php configuration differences between the Fermilab and IU sites, the IU site was not vulnerable to the exploit.

	* Here is what is currently online:
<ul>
<li>TWiki - all is well
<li>Registration Database - should be working just fine
<li>Mambo portion of opensciencegrid.org - all is fine (running on the backup site) although editing is turned off for the time being.
<li>Flat Files on opensciencegrid.org - not working at the time, we will mirror these soon.
</ul>

	* Barring any unforseen complications, OSG.org will return to normal service at fermilab today.
