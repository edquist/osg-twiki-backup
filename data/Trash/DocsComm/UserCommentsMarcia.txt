   * Miron:
      * [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/DocsComm/MeetWithMironFeb08][Full Notes from Meeting]]
      * Likes EGEE site, esp. "How to Join"
      * OSG Message:  Change way people think about computing; break things into smaller chunks to use resources most effectively.
      * Home page does not address WHAT IS OSG?
      * Get rid of grey bars in menu 
      * Contacts page is confusing. Why list Ruth?  osg-contact should be first point of contact.  Rotate between engagement, etc.?  (not my decision)
      * The first link under "OSG at Work" should be "What We Do."
      * Index pages need text (see [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Contact_us][Contact Us Page]]
   * Greg Thain (works for Miron):
      * Glossary should open in new window
      * Calendar not useful, no overview and don't like hovering to tell what's coming up (Alain & Greg)
      * Links not labeled for use, ie "Monitoring" should say "Site Usage" or something similar.
