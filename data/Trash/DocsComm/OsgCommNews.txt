%TOC%
---++ General:
   * Prepare press releases announcing major milestones and achievements, in coordination with communications offices of involved OSG partners (including Fermilab Public Affairs). 
   * Work with interested news media representatives to arrange interviews with OSG researchers and provide them with information about OSG.
   * Do we solicit too?
   * Work with members of the OSG Consortium and OSG users to report and generate news and feature stories for various outlets, including Science Grid This Week, the CERN Courier, Fermilab Today, GRIDtoday and symmetry magazine (list could be longer)
   * What other news outlets -- how to find out?  Google alerts 
   * Figure out how to get news (good and bad) from OSG to communications team before it goes public (e.g., security incidents)

---++ News Search Notes/Procedure
   * Set Google news alerts to search on:  OSG, Open Science Grid, cyberinfrastructure, LHC. Check Gridswatch, GridToday, Interactions.org and Supercomputing Online daily.  
   * If something is of obvious interest (mentions OSG specifically), post it on the OSG home page.  Inform the OSG Communicator (AH - aheaveyATfnal.gov) and copy Kurt Reiselman in FNAL Public Affairs (kurtrATfnal.gov).  If an item is questionable in its level of interest, check first with OSG Communicator. 
   * Post on News & Events page. "News from OSG" should be mainly our own press releases; the rest would be under "In the News".  
   * Post a copy in the News Archive.

---++ Monthly OSG Newsletter
[[CommArticlePlanning#NewsLetter][List of Planned Newsletter articles]]

Marcia Teckenbrock, Anne Heavey and Jen Nahn produce and publish newsletter. Contributors vary by issue. Ruth Pordes always contributes "From the Director".

[[NewsletterPublicationSteps][Procedure to Publish OSG News]] covers which pages to update and how to send the newsletter via email.

   * publish: Marcia (needs backup, need to cross-train)

Feature stories may be written by communications team or researcher/developer. They can double as isgtw stories and/or OSG research highlights. (As of Feb 07; just use the monthly res highlights for the application feature) Steps for writing/obtaining feature stories:
   1. Identify feature topic and the aspect(s) to cover
   2. If communications team to write,
