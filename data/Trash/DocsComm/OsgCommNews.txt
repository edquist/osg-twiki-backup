---++ General:
   * Prepare press releases announcing major milestones and achievements, in coordination with communications offices of involved OSG partners (including Fermilab Public Affairs). 
   * Work with interested news media representatives to arrange interviews with OSG researchers and provide them with information about OSG.
   * Do we solicit too?
   * Work with members of the OSG Consortium and OSG users to report and generate news and feature stories for various outlets, including Science Grid This Week, the CERN Courier, Fermilab Today, GRIDtoday and symmetry magazine (list could be longer)
   * What other news outlets -- how to find out?  Google alerts 
   * Figure out how to get news (good and bad) from OSG to communications team before it goes public (e.g., security incidents)

---++ News Search Notes/Procedure
   * Set Google news alerts to search on:  OSG, Open Science Grid, cyberinfrastructure, LHC. Check Gridswatch, GridToday, Interactions.org and Supercomputing Online daily.  
   * If something is of obvious interest (mentions OSG specifically), post it on the OSG home page.  Inform the OSG Communicator (AH - aheaveyATfnal.gov) and copy Kurt Reiselman in FNAL Public Affairs (kurtrATfnal.gov).  If an item is questionable in its level of interest, check first with OSG webmaster (use mailing list).
   * When posting on home page news box, use the format:  Title-linked - Source, Month dd, yyyy 
   * Post in News Archive. It's easiest to do this right after posting on home, as you can select and copy all the new items.

[[CommArticlePlanning#ResHigh][ List of Planned Research Highlights]]

Steps:
   1. Identify VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to highlight
   2. Figure out what's interesting about the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's work, develop questions
   2. Identify person(s) to interview - ideally only one, or two at most.
   3. Interview
   4. Write draft (the final will be a 400 word piece)

   6. Review by editing team and then interviewees
   7. Review by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo if desired/appropriate
   8. Review by Exec Board and by interviewees (send to osg-eb at opensciencegrid.org)
   9. Final revisions by editor
   10. Publish on OSG site (may also go to iSGTW; if so, publish first on OSG site, or simultaneously at latest) see mail from KY 19 dec 06 (KY cell 630 864 0074)   See Procedure for Posting [[ResearchHighlights]]

---++ Indico Calendar Tips and Tricks
   * Add meetings as meetings (not conferences)
Steps:
   1. Login and Add new Event which is a Meeting.
   2. Title will appear on "home". Title and description will be on meeting page as will everything on that first form. It works pretty well if you add a brief description, and for phone meetings, put number and ID in "Place".  When all info entered, click "OK".
   3. To link to the agenda and/or minutes from the meeting page, go to the Files tab, Add new Material and under Number of URLs, leave it at 1 for just one, select Agenda or Minutes or make a custom one, then paste the URL into place.  
   4. To link to an agenda from the meeting page ("Display"), you can also "Submit Material" (4 red icons left of title).
   5. If it's a recurring meeting, you can Clone it up to 10 times, also from the meeting page (red icon). You can clone it at intervals such as weekly. NOTA BENE! Look at "Choose Elements to Clone"!  Select "Attached Materials" if you've linked to a URL, or you will regret it.
   * IF you want to link directly from HOME to an external meeting page, here are the instructions:

<verbatim>the way to link from home is to explicitly put the HTML in the title

<a href="http://the twiki url"> Web pAge </a> -- you can test this out. you can even make it colored

<a href="..."> <font color=#00FFFFFF> Web Pages </font></a> - for example. You can try this in the descriptions as well as the title. It is clunky but works.</verbatim>
