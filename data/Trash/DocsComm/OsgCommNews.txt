%TOC%
---++ General:
   * Prepare press releases announcing major milestones and achievements, in coordination with communications offices of involved OSG partners (including Fermilab Public Affairs). 
   * Work with interested news media representatives to arrange interviews with OSG researchers and provide them with information about OSG.
   * Do we solicit too?
   * Work with members of the OSG Consortium and OSG users to report and generate news and feature stories for various outlets, including Science Grid This Week, the CERN Courier, Fermilab Today, GRIDtoday and symmetry magazine (list could be longer)
   * What other news outlets -- how to find out?  Google alerts 
   * Figure out how to get news (good and bad) from OSG to communications team before it goes public (e.g., security incidents)

---++ News Search Notes
   * Set Google news alerts to search on:  OSG, Open Science Grid, cyberinfrastructure, LHC. Check Gridswatch, GridToday, Interactions.org and Supercomputing Online daily.  
   * If something is of interest, send the link to OSG Communicator (AH) and she or you will also post it on the website. Put on home page if it mentions OSG specifically. Put on News & Events page. "News from OSG" should be mainly our own press releases; the rest would be under "In the News".  IMPORTANT: Remember to also put a copy in the News Archive.
