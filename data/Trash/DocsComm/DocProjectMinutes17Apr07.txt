---+ Documentation Project meeting agenda/minutes 17 Apr 07
d10 2
   * Last time: Anne, Craig, Kyle, Forrest, Chris G, Tim S

---++ Things that have come up
   * This is a number which can never reach 100%!  We agreed on 30% for now. AH to update WBS.

---+++ Chris G's Site Test Summary pages [[http://home.fnal.gov/~greenc/site_tests/Engage_20070404/]]
Ruth wants them integrated into the GOC validation/monitoring pages and VORS really because it makes people think about different views of information. %BR%
Preferred solution by Chris: %BR%
Use AFS and host an opensciencegrid.org address on the main FNAL server -- Keith tells me this is technically possible and reasonably straightforward. 
The technical part of the solution would be as follows:

Get an IP address attached to an opensciencegrid.org name (eg votests.opensciencegrid.org or usersupport.opensciencegrid.org); 
Have the web masters use this as a virtual host on the main server attached to some amount of project web space (say 2GB); 
---+++ New pages from old KnowledgeBase, need review by SMEs
   * How do I find out who participates in OSG [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Who_is_the_Open_Science_Grid%3F]] needs to answer the question
   * [[MailingListsSubscribe][How do I subscribe to OSG mailing lists, and which lists should I subscribe to?]]

   * clean up all old links in twiki

---++ Last meeting's action items
   * Please join osg-docs mailing list and get permissions to edit twiki, if not done already (AH added "stragglers"!)
   * AH to ask Kevin/Marcia: pull http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php page into website; make it look pretty %BLUE%done; see http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Support_Centers; fixed link in support page and support twiki %ENDCOLOR%
   * AH -- go through GOC list for VO liaisons, call them %BLUE% emailed most; VOs with no listed support emailed to goc %ENDCOLOR%
   * AH -- continue to go through old knowledgebase list to start identifying what needs updating
   * AH to ask John !DeStefano to do ATLAS pages in VO table
   * Add google searches -- AH and FC to discuss how best to implement
   * Forrest -- continue stuff
   * Forrest and Anne -- check into what prompted CE install guide test
   * Tim -- ops VO Webhome
   * AH send to CP the Knowledgebase text files %BLUE%done, but CP hasn't confirmed receipt%ENDCOLOR%
   * Craig -- look over existing doc and old KB stuff
   * Chris -- no direct Action items, but put site peculiarities info, stay involved with Forrest's work on user guide by def of user

---+++ Updates of VO web for Ops and Atlas
   * schedule?
Last time: Tim: will make some progress in next couple of weeks

John (sent email): I am in the process of establishing the
right group of people to get the information needed to update the ATLAS
VO information. 

---+++ CE install guide test on JW test server
   * status?
last time: Forrest -- haven't done yet; see how urgent it is, what prompted it -- take offline

---+++ Look and feel of doc twiki
   * status?
last time: Forrest: nothing yet in production, implement first on dev twiki, then move to test twiki on cmssrv09...8443, then when EB signs off, move to prod; now: testing on pattern skin.


---+++ End user doc
last time:
   * AH needs to work on; see "old knowledgebase pages" below
   * Ruth nixed the idea of moving user doc to web site; keep in in twiki
   * Forrest: Ruth asked about status of User Guide that you're working on; https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/GridUsersGuide; most recent edit 01 Feb.

last time: Forrest: what is meant by "user", above doc is complete, but not sufficient. Question about testing for accuracy.
Also: Need to know how to create/port app, the JDL, how to run app. Where, what are auth's, can my app get what it needs, etc. 

Forrest sent email post-meeting 3 Apr: I have started documenting what it will take to run a job on the OSG. See:
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianSandboxTesting
   * /Sandbox/ForrestChristianCanIRun
I think that the Porting The Application, which EGEE covers to great extent
in their documentation, is what we are missing.

---+++ VORS VO urls and VO !WebHome links
last time
   * Talk with Chris G and Abishek
   * Want to point users to VO sites and to VO/WebHome for links to those sites and/or actual info provided by VO
   * as first pass, should we point to VORS VO links from !VO/WebHome?

CG: not necessarily -- different objective in VORS (getting registered); no pattern to the URLs; better to ask the VO contacts (get from GOC)

   * identify and approach VO liaisons for end users  (AH to do; KG sent me url with names)
   * help users find accurate site information -- Is their VO supported? Does their app run?
   * what are VOs asking for?  What do their users need?
   * (nixed) possible action item: go through some of these VO urls, see if easy to navigate to instructions; if not, notify VO responsible person
