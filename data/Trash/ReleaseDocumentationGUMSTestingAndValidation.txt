---+ _%INCLUDEHEADING%  GUMS Testing and Validation_
This page contains the major changes in GUMS version 1.3 that should be tested besides the XACML2 interface, which is tested via PRIMA testing.  It assumes GUMS has been installed and that an administrator DN has been added using the gums-add-mysql-admin script.

---++ Database Stored Configuration

On the web interface, go to "Persistence Factories".  Click "Edit" on one of the persistence factories.  Make "Store Configuration" checked.  Then click save.  From this point the configuration will be stored in the database specified by the persistence factory.  It will also update the configuration on file (at $VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v55/webapps/gums/WEB-INF/config/gums.config).  Make sure that it is updated on file by checking the "Store Configuration" option you just checked. 

Changes made on file will also update the database.  Make a change on file by adding text to the description field of your persistence factory element.  IVerify that the update is reflected on the web interface by clicking on "Persistence Factories" and looking at the Description field you changed.

---++ Banned User Groups

On the web interface, go to "User Groups".  Click "add" at the bottom.  For type, choose the "manual" type.  Give it the name "Banned" without the quotes.  Click "save".  

Go to "Configuration" and choose the "Banned" user group next to "Banned User Group".

Choose a user that is mapped using both a grid proxy and a VOMS proxy certificate.  Verify this user's grid proxy certificate is mapped by going to "Map Grid Identity to Account" and filling in the service and user DN and clicking "map user".  You should get a non-null account.  Verify this user's VOMS proxy certificate is mapped by going to "Map Grid Identity to Account" and filling in the service DN, user DN, FQAN and clicking "map user".  You should get a non-null account. 

---+++ Test 1
Then, go to "Manual User Group Members".  Click "add".  Choose the "Banned" user group and put in the chosen user's DN with no FQAN.  Click "save".  Try the grid proxy and VOMS proxy certificate mappings again.  The grid proxy mapping should be null but not the VOMS proxy mapping.

---+++ Test 2
Remove the user from "Manual User Group Members" and add him again in the same way you did before, but with .* for the FQAN.  Try the grid proxy and VOMS proxy certificate mappings again.  Both the grid proxy mapping and VOMS proxy mapping should be null.

   1 Main.JohnWeigand (12/17/08) - Tested GUMS 1.3.7 - Success
%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Test 3
Remove the user from "Manual User Group Members" and add him again in the same way you did before, but with /&lt;VO&gt;.* for the FQAN.  Try the grid proxy and VOMS proxy certificate mappings again.  The grid proxy mapping should be non-null and the VOMS proxy mapping null.

---+++ Test 4
Remove the user from "Manual User Group Members".  Create a file called banned_users on the gums server with one line containing the user's DN and then a coma and then "/&lt;VO&gt;.*" without the quotes.  Create a file called unbanned_users on the gums server with one line containing the same thing. 

Edit the banned user group (named "Banned") and fill in "Member URI" with the path of the banned_users file.  Click "Update VO Members". Click on "Manual User Group Members".  Verify that an entry exists for the DN and FQAN you added to the banned_users file.  Make sure that the result is that same as before, that is, the grid proxy mapping should be non-null and the VOMS proxy mapping null.

---+++ Test 5
Edit the banned user group and fill in "Non-member URI" with the path of the unbanned_users file.  Click "Update VO Members".  Click on "Manual User Group Members".  Verify that an entry exists for the DN and FQAN you added to the unbanned_users file.  Make sure the grid proxy and VOMS proxy mappings both return a non-null account.

---++ Merge Configuration
Click on "Merge Configuration".  Put in the OSG template URL into the Configuration URI (shown in the example).  Click merge.  Click on Summary to see if all the OSG elements have been added and that it is using the persistence factory and host to group mapping that you specified.  Make a change to one of the OSG usergroups at "User Groups".  Then try the merge again to make sure that your change is undone.  Finally, copy the OSG template to file somewhere and try the merge from file instead (should have the prefix file:// instead of http://) and make sure there are no errors.
