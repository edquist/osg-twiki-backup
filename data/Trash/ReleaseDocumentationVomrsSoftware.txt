When you install the VOMRS node, it comes with quite a bit of software.  This section will help you learn how to find out the details for yourself.

---++ Finding all services that are part of your install
You can use the =vdt-control= command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  vdt-control --list
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-55          | init   | enable
voms               | init   | enable
vomrs              | init   | enable
</pre>

For debugging purposes _only_, you can look at =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/state=. This file is automatically generated and should _not_ be edited by hand. It contains all the information used by vdt-control to start and stop services in the VDT. 

Below we break down the services that you can expect to be on your system. All of these are listed by =vdt-control=: they are broken down here in order to give you more information.

---++ The init.d services that are included
The services installed and enabled are:
| *Service* | *Description* |
| apache | In front of tomcat |
| tomcat-55 | used by VOMRS WEB UI and webservices |
| mysql | Used by VOMS and VOMRS |
| voms | this is the voms server that services =voms-proxy-init= requests |
| vomrs | vomrs server that perform notification, synchronization with voms etc |


In addition, during the installation, a test VO called =VDT= will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the =VDT= VO will have to be performed separately.
