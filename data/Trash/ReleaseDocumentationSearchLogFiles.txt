---++ About This Document
This document covers examples of searching through a couple different types of log files, and what that will look like, when investigating an incident at a site.

---++ Search log files
The two primary log files which show authentication to the gatekeeper and gridftp servers are
<tt>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log</tt>
and
<tt>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log</tt>.
An excerpt from a gatekeeper log below shows an rsv probe authenticating and starting to run.

In this case you can see the <tt>globus user</tt> authenticates (an rsv probe)
and the gatekeeper starts up the fork jobmanager to run the rsv probe job.

The example below is an excerpt from the gridftp-auth.log file.

<pre class="file">
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: Server started in inetd mode.
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: Configuration read from /opt/osg-itb-1.0/globus/etc/gridf
tp.conf
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: New connection from: grolsch.lbl.gov:41305
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: DN /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=rsv/grolsch.lbl.gov
 successfully authorized.
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: User rsvuser successfully authorized.
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: Starting to transfer "//tmp/1248858480-gridftp-probe-test
-file-remote.32470".
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:00 2009 :: Finished transferring "//tmp/1248858480-gridftp-probe-tes
t-file-remote.32470".
[32500] Wed Jul 29 02:08:01 2009 :: Closed connection from grolsch.lbl.gov:41305
</pre>

In this example you again see an rsv probe authenticating and transfering a test file.

A (nearly?) complete list of log files shown on [[ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementLogFiles][this page]] is mostly useful for
diagnosing operational problems but can also be useful for forensics of a security incident.
