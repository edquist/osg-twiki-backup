This document aims to guide a grid user to verify the services that are installed as part of a Compute Element (CE). These services include the <b>Grid Service Allocation Manager (GRAM)</b> and the <b>GSI enabled FTP server (GSIFTP)</b>.

---++ Preliminary: Verify your Grid Credential

Your grid credential will be used to authenticate with every service provided by the CE. The authentication is based on the =X.509 Public Key Infrastructure= which consists of a private key (=userkey.pem=) and a public key (=usercert.pem=). Both files are by default located in =$HOME/.globus=:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ ls -al $HOME/.globus
total 68
drwxr-x---  4 robert robert  4096 Mar 18 18:50 .
drwx------ 29 robert robert 12288 Jul 28 08:38 ..
drwxrwxr-x  5 robert robert  4096 Jul 20 11:18 .gass_cache
drwx------  4 robert robert  4096 Mar 27 12:14 job
-rw-r-----  1 robert robert  1724 Dec 16  2008 usercert.pem
-r--------  1 robert robert  1919 Dec 16  2008 userkey.pem
</pre>

To display detailed information about your grid certificate =grid-proxy-info= can be used. This program is part of the Globus Toolkit and was installed during the CE installation procedure.

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ grid-proxy-info
subject  : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Robert Engel 392994/CN=1692124231
issuer   : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Robert Engel 392994
identity : /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Robert Engel 392994

strength : 512 bits
path     : /tmp/x509up_u500
timeleft : 291:11:00  (12.1 days)
</pre>

If there is no time left on your grid proxy, =grid-proxy-init= can be used to create a new grid proxy.

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ grid-proxy-init -valid 500:00
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Robert Engel 392994
Enter GRID pass phrase for this identity:
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until: Tue Aug 18 08:06:35 2009
</pre>

---++ Test the Grid Resource Allocation Manager - GRAM

A program can be executed remotely on a grid resource if the resource provides an interface to GRAM. By default GRAM is listening on port =2119=. You can verify that GRAM is running by using telnet:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ telnet osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu 2119
Trying 131.215.114.48...
Connected to osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu (131.215.114.48).
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>

Using =telnet= only verifies if GRAM is provided on the <b>server side</b>. Please ask the grid resource administrator if you cannot connect to GRAM using telnet on port 2119. The service may be down or provided on a different port or host all together.

To verify GRAM from the <b>client side</b> =globus-job-run= can be used to execute a program on the grid resource:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-job-run osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

=/usr/bin/id= will return the unix account used to execute the program on the grid resource. Upon success you verified that GRAM is working on the grid resource and that your grid credential was mapped to a unix account on the resource. Please contact the grid resource administrator if =globus-job-run= did not complete successfully.

If you are the grid resource administrator and have sufficient access privileges, you will find a record of the job submission in =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= :

---++ Test the Availability of a Job Manager

A =job manager= is a process running on the gatekeeper which is managing the execution of your job. By default =fork= will be used to fork your program directly on the gatekeeper. As a general rule of thumb you should avoid to use =fork= and to execute programs on the gatekeeper unless that is your intention. A not complete list of job managers includes =fork=, =managedfork=, =ccs=, =condor=, =lsf=, =pbs= and =sge=. Depending on the setup of the grid resource more than one job manager will be available.

Following the example above you can use =globus-job-run= to verify that job manager =fork= is available:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-job-run osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id
uid=506(ligo) gid=506(ligo) groups=506(ligo)
</pre>

Notice how we append =/jobmanager-fork= to the grid resource to request job manager =fork= explicitly now. Next, let's find out if job manager =condor= is available:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-job-run osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu/jobmanager-condor /bin/hostname
dom118
</pre>

Because the job is scheduled to be executed through Condor this command will likely require more time to complete. Here we used =/bin/hostname= to return the hostname of the worker node executing the job. To specify a job manager that is not supported by the grid resource makes for a convenient way to find out what job managers are supported by the resource using the comfort of the command line:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-job-run osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu/jobmanager-pbs /bin/hostname
GRAM Job submission failed because the gatekeeper failed to find the requested service (error code 93)
[robert@osg-job ~]$ echo $?
93
</pre>

Please note that the <b>names for job managers are case sensitive</b> and are <b>all lower case for GRAM</b>.

---++ Transferring files using !GridFTP

The !GridFTP server runs on port =2811= by default. Same as above we will use =telnet= to verify that the service is available:

<pre class="screen">
robert@osg-job ~]$ telnet osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu 2811
Trying 131.215.114.48...
Connected to osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu (131.215.114.48).
Escape character is '^]'.
220 osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu GridFTP Server 2.8 (gcc64dbg, 1217607445-63) [VDT patched 4.0.8] ready.
Connection closed by foreign host.
</pre>
 
To verify that !GridFTP is working correctly we will first create a file using =dd=, transfer the file with =globus-url-copy= and verify that arrived on the grid resource using =globus-job-run=. First let's create the test file:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu.test.0 bs=1k count=1024
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1048576 bytes (1.0 MB) copied, 0.005173 seconds, 203 MB/s
</pre>

Next let's transfer the file with =globus-url-copy=:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-url-copy file:///tmp/osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu.test.0 gsiftp://osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu/~/osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu.test.0
[robert@osg-job ~]$ echo $?
0
</pre>

Last but not least let's double check the file arrived at specified location:

<pre class="screen">
[robert@osg-job ~]$ globus-job-run osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu /bin/bash -c "ls -al \$HOME/osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu.test.0"
-rw-r--r-- 1 ligo ligo 1048576 Jul 28 13:47 /home/ligo/osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu.test.0
</pre>

Please contact the grid resource administrator if you failed to execute the example above. If you are the grid resource administrator and have sufficient access privileges you can find a record of the !GridFTP transfer in  =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log=

<pre class="screen">
