---++ About This Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for System Administrators installing Gratia dCache  transfer or storage probes.

The probes report storage related information to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector][the central Gratia collector]]. There are two types of probes:
   * The dCache-transfer probe reports to Gratia the details of each file transfer into or out of a dCache file server. 
   * The dCahche-storage probe is responsible for reporting storage capacity and storage usage to the central Gratia collector. The information reported is:
      * The storage capacity and amount used for each dCache pool.
      * The storage capacity and amount used for each SRM Space reservation.
---+++ Applicable Versions
Gratia dCache probes can be downloaded  from  [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html][VDT dCache homepage]]. They are packaged as rpms and are included in vdt-dcache distribution. The rpms could be also downloaded directly from VDT dCache homepage. 

Gratia dCache probes also depend on 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.3* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations

<div id="indent">
It is recommended that the Gratia dCache probes are installed on the dCache admin node, where dcache billing database is located. dCache transfer probe must perform queries on the billing database so if the probe is installed somewhere else  you will need to configure database access accordingly. dCache storage probe doesn't require to be installed on admin node, it is polling information from dCache Information Provider.
</div>
The installation procedure depends on your current dCache installation. You can do one of the following actions:
   * Install  vdt-dCache (fresh install) 
   * Upgrade existing vdt-dCache installation (full upgrade)
   * Upgrade just Gratia dCache probes without upgrading vdt-dCache (partial upgrade)
   * Install Gratia dCache probes on top of dCache installed from [[http://www.dcache.org][dCache site]] (installation without vdt-dcache)

---+++!!Help!
If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]].


---++Checklist

   1. dCache probes depend  on pyOpenSSL package. Please installed it using yum (or find appropriate rpm package). See [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]] for help.
   1.  [[PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is required in order to create OSG User-VO Mapping. Please read  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/OsgSupportedVos][this page]] about files that are required to accurately collect grid resource usage and metrics by VO for transfer submitted using grid proxies or where voms proxy information is not available. 

---++Installation Procedure
---+++  Installation of Gratia dCache probes with vdt-dCache installation (fresh install)

Gratia dCache probes are part of vdt-dcache distribution and could be installed simultaneously with dCache. The whole installation procedure is described at [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras//2.4.8/InstallingDcacheForOSG.README.html][VDT-dCache Installation]].

%ICON{"warning"}% Please read [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras//2.3.1/InstallingDcacheForOSG.README.html][ITB version VDT-dCache Installation]].

Before installing vdt-dCache you will need to  modify _siteinfo.conf_ file under _vdt-dcache-SLx-y/install_ directory. To enable the probes find and modify the following entry:

<pre class="file">
# Would you like to install/use Gratia dCache storage and transfer probes?
# Options: yes or no
INSTALL_DCACHE_GRATIA_PROBES="yes"
</pre>

In order to configure Gratia dCache probes you will need to modify the parameters listed listed under section #3 of the file (named "Gratia dCache storage and transfer probes"). You have to change at least the folowing parameters:
<pre class='file'>
<verbatim>
GRATIA_SOAP_HOST="<gratia-collector-host>:<gratia-collector-port>"
GRATIA_SITE_NAME="<site-name>"
GRATIA_GRID_NAME="<grid-name>"
</verbatim>
</pre>

See more options in [[#DebugInfo][Debugging Information]] for more options.

Your entries depend on the type of your site:

 _gratia-collector-host_:_gratia-collector-port_ - gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org:80 for OSG or gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80 for ITB, if your site is running its own collector you should specify the hostname and port of that collector

_grid-name_ - OSG or OSG-ITB

When you proceed with vdt-dcache installation _install.py_ script will unpack the Gratia probes on admin node and will modify the configuration files.
The following rpms will be installed:
   * gratia-probe-common-&lt;version&gt;.noarch.rpm
   * gratia-probe-dCache-storage-itb-&lt;version&gt;.noarch.rpm          
   * gratia-probe-dCache-transfer-itb-&lt;version&gt;.noarch.rpm         
   * gratia-probe-extra-libs-&lt;version&gt;.noarch.rpm
   * gratia-probe-extra-libs-arch-spec-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;arch&gt;.rpm
   * gratia-probe-services-&lt;version&gt;.&lt;arch&gt;.rpm                       

To continue with the installation please go to  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaDcacheProbes#Setting_index_on_dCache_billing][Setting index on dCache billing database]] section.

---+++  Upgrade existing vdt-dCache installation (full upgrade)

If you already installed vdt-dcache and are in the process of upgrading it you should follow instructions provided in [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras//2.4.8/UpgradeDcacheForOSG.html][Upgrade Procedure Document]]. 

%ICON{"warning"}% Please read [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/extras//2.3.1/UpgradeDcacheForOSG.html][ITB version Upgrade Procedure Document]].

If you had configured and enabled Gratia probes during initial installation go to  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaDcacheProbes#Setting_index_on_dCache_billing][Setting index on dCache billing database]] section.

If you didn't enable Gratia dCache probe last time you have installed dCache, please proceed to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaDcacheProbes#Enabling_Gratia_dCache_Probes][Enabling Gratia dCache Probes]] section.


---+++  Upgrade gratia dCache probes without upgrading vdt-dCache (partial upgrade) or Install  without vdt-dcache
If you already installed vdt-dcache and just want to upgrade Gratia  dCache probes or  you want to install Gratia  dCache probes on top of "native" dCache installation you have to do the following steps on admin node:
  1. download the new release (Check the right architecture, OS and postgres version):
<pre class="screen">
cd /usr/local/vdt-dcache-SL&lt;OS&gt;_&lt;ARCH&gt;-&lt;VERSION&gt;/RPMS
wget http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/dcache/gratia/&lt;VERSION&gt;_post_8.3.7/gratia-probe-dcache-&lt;VERSION&gt;_sl&lt;OS&gt;_&lt;ARCH&gt;_postgres_8.3.7.tar.gz
</pre>

  where  sl&lt;OS&gt; could be sl4 or sl5,  &lt;ARCH&gt; should be replaced with "32" or "64" and &lt;VERSION&gt; is the current production or ITB version.
             
<pre class="screen">
wget http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/dcache/gratia/1.06.15d-1_post_8.3.7/gratia-probe-dcache-1.06.15d-1_sl5_64_postgres_8.3.7.tar.gz
</pre>

  2. Untar file:
<pre class="screen">
tar xvfz gratia-probe-dcache-&lt;VERSION&gt;_sl&lt;OS&gt;_&lt;ARCH&gt;_postgres_8.3.7.tar.gz 
</pre>

  3. Upgrade all rpms that have been created during the previous step:
<pre class="screen">
rpm -Uvh gratia-probe-dCache-transfer-itb-&lt;VERSION&gt;.noarch.rpm   
rpm -Uvh  gratia-probe-dCache-storage-itb-&lt;VERSION&gt;.noarch.rpm  
rpm -Uvh  gratia-probe-common-&lt;VERSION&gt;.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh  gratia-probe-extra-libs-&lt;VERSION&gt;.noarch.rpm
rpm -Uvh  gratia-probe-extra-libs-arch-spec-&lt;VERSION&gt;.i386.rpm
#or
rpm -Uvh  gratia-probe-extra-libs-arch-spec-&lt;VERSION&gt;.x86_64.rpm
</pre>


To configure and enable Gratia dCache probes during initial installation go to  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaDcacheProbes#Setting_index_on_dCache_billing][Setting index on dCache]] section.

If you didn't enable gratia dCache probe last time you have installed dCache, please proceed to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation//GratiaDcacheProbes#Enable_Gratia_dCache_Probes_Manually][Enable Gratia dCache Probes]] section.

---++Enabling Gratia dCache Probes Manually 
%ICON{"warning"}% If you are doing upgrade of Gratia dCache probes keep in mind that _ProbeConfig_ has been changed!!!. The new file will be _ProbeConfig.rpmnew_. You will need to edit _ProbeConfig,rpmnew_ file incorporating all the modifications you have done in old _ProbeConfig_, then move _ProbeConfig.rpmnew_ to _ProbeConfig_.

If you have not enable Gratia probe you  have to modify Gratia dCache probes configuration files manually. In order to do so, you have to login on admin node and modify __ProbeConfig__ files for storage and transfer probes. The ProbeConfig files for storage and transfer probes are  located under ==/opt/d-cache/gratia/probe/dCache-storage== and ==/opt/d-cache/gratia/probe/dCache-transfer== directories.
You have to edit both files. On dCache admin node do the following:
<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/d-cache/gratia/probe/dCache-transfer/
edit ProbeConfig   
</pre>

The minimum set of parameters that have to be  modified for transfer probe:
<pre class="file">
<verbatim>
CollectorHost="<gratia-collector-host>:<gratia-collector-port>"
SiteName="<site-name>"
Grid="<grid-name>" 
OnlySendInterSiteTransfers="false"
EnableProbe="1"
DCacheServerHost="<dcache-admin-node>"
EmailServerHost="smtp.domain>"
EmailFromAddress="dCacheProbe"
EmailToList="<email1@domain,email2@domain>"
</verbatim>
</pre>

and for storage probe:
<pre class="file">
<verbatim>
CollectorHost="<gratia-collector-host>:<gratia-collector-port>"
SiteName="<site-name>"
Grid="<grid-name>" 
InfoProviderUrl = "http://<dcache-admin-node>:2288/info"
</verbatim>
</pre>

Where 
 
_gratia-collector-host_:_gratia-collector-port_ - gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org:80 for OSG or gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org:80 for ITB, if your site is running its own collector you should specify the hostname and port of that collector

_grid-name_ - OSG or OSG-ITB

_smtp.domain_     -  your  smtp server

_email1@domain,email2@domain_ - list of email addresses that will receive email when probe server start/stop

_dcache-admin-node_ - fqn of dCache admin node

---++ Setting index on dCache billing database

If you already set index on your billing database skip this section. Index shoud be set on the datestamp and transaction fields, otherwise the probe will put significant load on your DB! 

In order to set index you have to log in to the billing DB using the following command:
<pre class="screen">
psql -U postgres billing
\d doorinfo
\d billinginfo
# If you don't see an index, execute the following commands:

create unique index transaction on doorinfo(transaction);
create index dates_di on doorinfo(datestamp);
create index initiator on billinginfo(initiator);
create index dates on billinginfo(datestamp);
</pre>
 
The above commands may take awhile before they finish, especially if your billing database is large.

---++ Creating  OSG User-VO Mapping 

Please read  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/OsgSupportedVos][this page]] about files that are required to accurately collect grid resource usage and metrics by VO for transfer submitted using grid proxies or where voms proxy information is not available. 

You will have to install VO-Map-Utilities from VDT. In order to so you will need first to download and install pacman:
<pre class="screen">
wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.28.tar.gz
tar xzf pacman-3.28.tar.gz
cd pacman-3.28
. setup.sh
</pre>


Then you have to decide if you are going to use gridmap-file or GUMS for user-vo mapping and answer appropriately questions asked during package installation. If you are using GUMS, setup VDT_GUMS_HOST:

<pre class="screen">
<verbatim>
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=<GUMS hostname>  
</verbatim>
</pre>

Install vo-map-utilities:

<pre class="screen">
<verbatim>
cd /opt
mkdir  osg_vo_map
cd osg_vo_map
pacman -get  %CACHE%:VO-Map-Utilities
. setup.sh
</verbatim>
</pre>

 Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=).

The install procedure will print out a warning:
<verbatim>
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</verbatim>

The information provided in the README is out of date. Please setup the CA certificates in the following way instead:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local -url osg
</pre>
This command will download certificates distributed by the OSG to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= and create a symlink from =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to that location. [[VDTCAManage][Other options]] are also available.

To reflect the changes update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. To see all services available use =vdt-control -list=
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
vdt-control --list
</pre>

You will have to enable and start all the services:

   * if you are using GUMS
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control -enable gums-host-cron
vdt-control -on gums-host-cron
touch $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-attributes.conf
$VDT_LOCATION/gums/scripts/gums-host-cron
</pre>

   * if you are using edg-grid-map file
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control -enable edg-mkgridmap
vdt-control -on edg-mkgridmap
</pre>

To enable and start crl download , certificate update

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control -enable vdt-update-certs fetch-crl
vdt-control -on vdt-update-certs fetch-crl
</pre>

Check that osg-user-vo-map.txt is present and not empty, eg:
<pre class="screen">
ls -l   $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 6224 Apr 14 14:23 /opt/vdt_vomap/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt
</pre>

As a last step you will need to modify _ProbeConfig_ files  to add location of osg-user-vo-map.txt.
<pre class="file">
UserVOMapFile="/opt/osg_vo_map/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt"
</pre>

---++ Starting/Stopping Gratia dCache Probes

To start/stop Gratia dCache-transfer probe that should be running on dCache admin host do the following:
<pre class="screen">
/etc/init.d/gratia-dcache-transfer start/stop
</pre>

Gratia dCache-storage probe is a cronjob that is run by default every hour. The cron file gratia-probe-dcache-storage.cron is located in /etc/cron.d
 
---++ Sanity Check

If you turned on  Gratia dCache probes you should be able to see the accounting information by accessing your Gratia collector. Keep in mind that storage probe collection is executed by a cron job, so check the time the cron job will be executed:
<pre class="screen">
[root@gwdca04 ~]# cat /etc/cron.d/gratia-probe-dcache-storage.cron 
22 * * * * root "/opt/d-cache/gratia/probe/dCache-storage/dCache-storage_meter.cron.sh"
</pre>

To access the information about Gratia dCache-transfer probe, go to http://&lt;gratia_host&gt;:&lt;gratia_port&gt;/gratia-reporting/, click on "Custom SQL Query" on the left site menu frame, enter the following query into provided text box:
<pre class="screen">
select * from MasterTransferSummary where ProbeName like 'dcache-transfer:&lt;dcache_admin_host_name&gt;';
</pre>
click on "Execute Query" and you will see the total number of transfer per user.


To access the information about Gratia dCache-storage probe, go to http://&lt;gratia_host&gt;:&lt;gratia_port&gt;/gratia-reporting/, click on "Custom SQL Query" on the left site menu frame, enter the following query into provided text box:
<pre class="screen">
select * from StorageElement where ProbeName like 'dcache-storage:&lt;dcache_admin_host_name&gt;';
</pre>

click on "Execute Query" and you will see the storage information.
