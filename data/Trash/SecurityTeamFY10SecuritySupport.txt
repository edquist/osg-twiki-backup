      * New Sites in 2009: AGLT2_CE_2 (USATLAS), CIT_CMS_T2B (USCMS), CLEMSON-Palmetto (Engagement), CNIC-OSG (CIGI), firefly/prairiefire (USCMS), Firefly 2 (USCMS), Firefly-3 (CSC), GRASE-CSE-MAGIC, HEPGRID_UERJ_OSG64 (CSC), HEPGRID_UERJ_OSG64 (USCMS), NYSGRID-ALBANY-ATHENA, NYSGRID-CUNY-GRID, OSG-CMS (USCMS), Rice, UCD_CMS_T3 (CSC), UCHC_CBG, UJ-OSG (USATLAS tier3 south african group), UTA_SWT2_SE (USATLAS), UTD-HEP, WQCG-Harvard-OSG (SBGrid), rutgers-cms (CSC)
   * Smaller ("tier 3") sites and VOs.

Subject: OSG security courtesy call

Hello ###,

I'm a member of the OSG security team. As part of the support that we
provide to OSG VOs and sites, I'm calling VO and site security
contacts (such as yourself) to (re-)introduce myself and our team,
discuss OSG security practices, learn more about your security
environment, and discuss your security concerns and support needs.

Are you available ### at ### Central Time for a 30 minute (or less)
phone call? If not, could you please suggest a time when you're
available? Is ### the right number for me to call?

For your reference, OSG Security information is online at
<https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security> and the security team
can be contacted by security@opensciencegrid.org.

I look forward to speaking with you.

Sincerely,
Jim Basney

---++ Support Needs

Here we list and track security support needs that have been raised by OSG sites and/or VOs during FY10.
(Is there a better way to track them?)

---+++ Active Support Items

   * UCD_T3: Secure distribution of software and CA certificates. The vdt-update-certs script should check signatures and/or use HTTPS. OSG/VDT software should be signed and/or checksums published. Concern also about Scientific Linux not providing checksums or signed packages.
   * UCD_T3: Better documentation of services and ports required. Publish recommended firewall rules. Current documentation is at ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementFirewalls. What about Storage Elements? Request sent to osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org.
   * UCD_T3: Some OSG software (CEMon?) can't call-out to GUMS and requires a grid-mapfile?
   * UCD_T3: Drop FNAL MD5 CA. Move to SHA-2. See SecurityTeamTeamTeamTeamTeamTeam.HashAlgorithms.
   * IllinoisHEP: Support for syslog-ng. More tools for monitoring for security events and security problems.
   * IllinoisHEP: Seeing GUMS errors connecting to VOMS servers (GPN VOMS is down). Seeing fetch-crl errors show up in RSV (ULAGrid CA outage).
   * UTA_SWT2: Would appreciate more monitoring / advice regarding timely certificate revocation and VOMS updates. Not sure how to detect when GUMS fails to pull latest from VOMS.
