%TOC%
%NOTE% The following sections are intended to be a super set for an Install Document.  Particular sections may not apply to all documents, but use all the sections that make sense for the installation you are documenting.  Also, for simple cases, some sections can be combined.  For example, Service Startup/Shutdown could be combined with Validation in a single section.
%NOTE% Items in common with many installs should have their own page and be pointed to by or included in the Installation document.

---++ Introduction
Brief description of function of software and how it fits into the overall system.

---++ Applicable Software Versions
OSG releases (for OSG 1.2 or later)

Note that standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist

This procedure covers the success legs only 

How should most common failures be documented?  (E.g. Wrong Pacman)
