%DOC_STATUS_TABLE%
%TOC{depth="2"}%
%NOTE% The following sections are intended to be a super set for an Install Document.  Particular sections may not apply to all documents, but use all the sections that make sense for the installation you are documenting.
%NOTE% Items in common with many installs should have their own page and be pointed to by or included in the Installation document.
%NOTE% Create a new Install document for any version requiring more than a few changes to the procedure.

---++ About This Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is intended for System Administrators that are installing ...

Include a brief description of function of software and how it fits into the overall system.

---+++ Applicable Versions

The applicable software versions for this document are 
%RED%
*osg-version x.y* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  a.b*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---++ Requirements

This section serves as an early exit point for readers of the document. It must list all requirements that have to be met in order for a typical installation to succeed. All tools mentioned must be linked. All terminologies used should be linked to the Glossary explaining them. For example:

   1 verify that your operating system is [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][supported]].
   1 a %LINK_PACMAN% installation of version %PACMAN_VERSION%.
   1 except for worker node installations a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] is required.
   1 to test and use the installation a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] is required.
   1 unset the environment variable *VDT_LOCATION* in case it has previously been set.

---++ Introduction (optional)

This section may be used to provide brief background explanations. For instance what the purpose of the installed software is, why it is needed, how it fits the overall picture.

---++ Installation Procedure

The first item here should be a numbered list of steps that provide the reader with an overview about the installation process. For example:

The installation procedure consists of the following steps:

   1 create an empty installation directory
   1 use %LINK_PACMAN% to install the OSG Client Tools Package
   1 install the [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%
   1 configure logfile rotation and automatic updates of [[Documentation/GlossaryC#DefsCA][CA Certificates]] and the %LINK_GLOSSARY_CRL%

---+++ 1st Step of the Installation Procedure

each step mentioned above should have its own subsection explaining the procedure

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using 

<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> 

tag which will look like this.

<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>

%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---+++ 2nd Step of the Installation Procedure

The 2nd step.


---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown

Description of the steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
This often requires, the reader to edit lines in a config file.
If this is necessary, put the lines in a screen box with a yellow background 
(to distinguish from entering commands (green box).
<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation
Commands to be used to verify the service is working correctly.  This can be combined with the previous section if they are both short.

---++ Debugging Information
---+++ File Locations
Locations of configuration files, input/output files, log files, etc. that are important for an administrator to know about if something doesn't work.  

---+++ Debugging Procedure
What are the first things to check, step-by-step instructions to determine source of problem for this service

If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is outline in HelpProcedure.

---+++ Caveats/Known Issues
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues
