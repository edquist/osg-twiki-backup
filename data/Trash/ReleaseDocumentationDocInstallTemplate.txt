%TOC%
%NOTE% The following sections are intended to be a super set for an Install Document.  Particular sections may not apply to all documents, but use all the sections that make sense for the installation you are documenting.  Also, for simple cases, some sections can be combined.  For example, Service Startup/Shutdown could be combined with Validation in a single section.
%NOTE% Items in common with many installs should have their own page and be pointed to by or included in the Installation document.

---++ Introduction
Brief description of function of software and how it fits into the overall system.

---++ Applicable Software Versions
OSG releases (for OSG 1.2 or later)
<br/>
Pacman Version required

%NOTE% Create a new Install document for any version requiring more than a few changes to the procedure.
---++ Engineering Considerations
A link to document containing Engineering considerations

E.g. Needs to be installed on its own server, can be combined with some other service, need to have multiple servers depending on site size, etc.

%BLUE%
--------
%NOTE% We need to discuss how to handle the next 3 sections
---++ First Time Install
A link to document containing information and install steps that only need to be performed if this a first time install.
---++ Fresh Install Procedure
A link to a document containing special steps for doing a fresh install
---++ Update Procedure
A link to a document containing steps for doing an update
%BR%
This may be covered in a more general document for a particular update of several packages
-------
%ENDCOLOR%
---++ Checklist
A link to or an in-line list of items assumed to have been already performed
%BR%
Should this be in-line to make it more likely that a user will see he/she does not have something set up correctly for the install?

E.g. Installs that must be done before this one, security environment in place, batch system in place, certificates, stop old service, things that need to be in the path, etc.
---++ Installation Procedure
The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using <verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 
%BR%
%BLUE%
How should most common failures be documented?  (E.g. Wrong Pacman)

Link to the standard approach to handle failures (E.g. Come to the Campfire, Send email to osg-sites list [what is the ordered list of ways to get help for this install])
%ENDCOLOR%
---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Description of the Steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
---++ Validation of Service Operation
