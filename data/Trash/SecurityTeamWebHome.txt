---+!! OSG Cyber Security

%TOC%

---++ Security Office
Mine Altunay is the OSG Security Officer with responsibility for developing the cyber security plan
and ensuring that it is executed. Bob Cowles and Doug Olson are members of the OSG security team, where Bob is responsible for OSG policy development work and Doug is responsible for DOEGrids RA operations. 
 
---+++Security Plan
The OSG Security Plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG-Doc-389]]) 
is one of the deliverables of the OSG project jointly funded by DOE and NSF.
The first accepted version of the plan is delivered and may be revised in the future.  Such revisions may be developed at SecurityPlanning.

---+++ Risk Assessment
The security group has made a first pass at risk assessment and the resulting document is (someplace).

---+++ Incident Discovery and Reporting

The cyberspace defined by Grids transcends organizational boundaries. Although the Grid doesn't create 
fundamentally new cyber security risks it does serve to amplify some risks. A compromised identity or resource at 
one institution presents immediate risk of further compromise, attack, or identity theft to all institutions 
participating in the grid. All security incidents must be reported *immediately*.

If you suspect a security problem  e-mail security@opensciencegrid.org, or abuse@opensciencegrid.org (This email address is being protected 
from spam bots.  Javascript must be enabled to view it.) Or call Grid Operation Center (GOC) at +1 317-278-9699. In addition, a ticket to GOC can also be submitted. 

In  your email to GOC (security@opensciencegrid.org), the following information must be included: 

the name of the responders;

phone; 

alternate phone; 

e-mail address;

Grid Virtual Organization (VO);

whether your grid identity been compromised ; 

incident description, including time(s), systems involved and their description; 

any other additional information, e. g. contacts, etc.

An incident response plan for the Open Science Grid is available at [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=19&version=2&filename=OSG_incident_handling_v1.0.pdf][this link]]. 

If you (as the reporting party) are unfamiliar with the incident reporting process, there are a few things you should be aware of.

   1. if the incident involves your local/home organization, in addition to involving the Grid, you must report to your home/local organization by using its incident handling process,

       
   2. Each local organization that is a member of the grid has security contacts announced to the Grid management. If you are not the grid security contact for your local organization,  you should report the incident to the security contact designated for your organization.  

    If you already know your organization's grid security contact and have already reported the incident to him/her, you may not have to take any further action. It is the responsibility of the grid security contact to report incidents to the Grid management. In any other case, you must immediately use the email and phone numbers provided above for reporting to the Grid management.

---+++ Security Email Lists
All email lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain. 

*tg-security* provides communication among, OSG, OSG partners and external collaborators. The current list of members have not been changed. This list includes public data. This list will be used for announcements to our partners and will have a decreased workload compared to the past. OSG staff's day-day discussion will be removed from this list and moved to the security-discuss-l.

*security-discuss-l* (also known as *security-discuss-OSG_LIMITED_DISTR*) provides communication among OSG Security team and related OSG Staff. This list is to discuss OSG security team's day-day activities and internal planning.  This list includes limited data, which is only related to OSG business. The limited data is classified as any data that should only be accessed by an authorized group of individuals. The recipients of limited data can re-distribute to third parties if the first recipient deems the third party trustworthy and the re-distribution does not break the use care agreement between the first recipient and the data owner. 

*security-discuss-restricted* provides communication among OSG Staff. This list only includes restricted data. Restricted data has more stringent access requirements than the limited data: restricted data has a precise list of authorized individuals and re-distribution to third parties is not allowed. This list is used for discussing security vulnerabilities and emergencies. This list is not for general discussion, and the frequency of usage must be relatively low with respect to other lists. Therefore, an email message coming through this channel must be immediately noticed and paid attention. 

*security* and *abuse*: Are the standard email addresses for public reporting of security incidents. Mail to these addresses is received by the iGOC OSG Operations Support Center. The 24x7 iGOC filters the mail for SPAM or other off-topic content, opens or updates a security incident ticket, and forwards the orginal e-mail along with ticket information to the INCIDENT-REPORT-L or INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L lists as appropriate (see below). The iGOC acts immediately on all mail incoming to this address.

*incident-report-l* is a closed list comprised of the primary grid security contacts for all sites and support centers. The list is intended solely for initial incident reporting - not for incident discussion. All email to this list is echoed to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L and mail REPLY TO: is configured to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L. Because this list is restricted solely to the initial reporting of an incident, inbound communications to this list can be used to drive alerting mechanisms - e.g. alarms in support centers, level-1 messages to Blackberrys, etc. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.


*incident-discuss-l* is a closed list comprised of the same members as INCIDENT-REPORT-L plus other grid security contacts who are concerned with incident discussion. The list is intended for discussion of reported incidents. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.


---+++ Awareness and Training Program
The OSG Security Plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG-Doc-389]]) describes the topics and purpose for security awareness and training for people involved with OSG.
There are two relevant [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html][NIST documents]] that provide guidelines for developing computer security awareness and training programs,
which are [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-50/NIST-SP800-50.pdf][NIST SP800-50]] and 
[[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-16/800-16.pdf][NIST SP800-16]].  
At present, this program is [[Security.SecurityPlanning#Developing_the_Awareness_and_Tra][being developed.]]

---++Security Technical Group

The Security Technical group is responsible for coordinating the OSG activities that relate to security policy, practices and services. These include:

   * Negotiation of common security principles and expectations for security across the Consortium.
   * Development and oversight of common requirements and architecture for security management across the Consortium.
   * Identification of necessary projects and work needed for a coherent, complete Security infrastructure on the common grid.
   * Published information about storage resources, including monitoring information, and agreements for their use.
   * Interoperability of Security infrastructure across different
      administrative domains, initially OSG and EGEE through the LCG Joint Security Group.

The chairs are Bob Cowles and Jed Dobson. Group membership is approximated by the current membership of the tg-security mailing list. (Send mail to listserv@fnal.gov, leave subject blank, add message contents: REVIEW TG-SECURITY to see current membership.) This list is open to general participation.  You can join or leave the list or review its previous messages via the list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/tg-security.html][archive page]] if desired.

---+++ Controls Assessement
The controls described in the security plan are periodically assessed for compliance.
A table showing the current status of the assessment for 2007 is shown at ControlsAssessment2007.


---++Policy Development

---+++ OSG Policies and Procedures

The compete list of OSG policies and agreement templates can be found at the OSG [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Security/PolicyandProcedureTable][Security Policy Table]].  
There are several policies that are still works in progress and their status is indicated in the policy table. the most current documents are linked at this table. In addition, OSG participates into Joint Security Policy Group (JSPG), which aims to develop security policies for WLCG, EGEE and OSG. The security policy table indicates which policies are developed jointly and their status within the JSPG. There are policies which are specific enough to OSG that they are not developed jointly, hence only listed as OSG documents. 

---+++ JSPG

OSG participates in the Joint Security Policy Group,  which aims to generate common security policies across WLCG, EGEE and OSG. The JSPG policies are often defined at a higher level that would state the common requirements among the grids. Each grid can define its own specifics to a JSPG policy so that grid-specific requirements can also be stated.  A grid-based specification adheres to the JSPG policy, while it yields for the divergences among grids. the WLCG, EGEE and OSG separately approves a JSPG working document before it becomes a JSPG policy. The list of working documents of the JSPG are at http://proj-lcg-security.web.cern.ch/proj-lcg-security/documents.html. 



---+++VO Privilege Project

The VOPrivilegeProject is developing and implementing finer-grained authorization for access to grid-enabled resources and services in order to improve user account assignment and management at grid sites, and reduce the associated administrative overhead.
