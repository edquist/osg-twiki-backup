---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo usage of OSG facilities:
[[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview][This page provides an overview of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo usage of OSG facilities for 2007]].  

Here are various notes:

HEP VOs:
   * [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=cms][CMS]] - peak at 916k hours / week.  Averaged over 800k hours / week during November 2007 (CSA07).  Averaged ~700k hours/week during summer production run (July - September).
   * [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=cdf][CDF]] - peak at 550k hours / week.  Saw about a 5x increase in CPU hours usage from Jan 2007 to Jan 2008.  Still heavily FNAL-based.
   * [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=usatlas][ATLAS]] - peak at 450k hours / week, less than CDF's 550k peak.  Averaged around 250k hours / week.
   * [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=dzero][DZero]] shows a wide diversity of sites - no individual site has a lion's share of the work.

Question: Why does ATLAS see only about half the amount of CPU hours as CMS?

Non-HEP VOs:
   * [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=nysgrid][NYSgrid]] is a new effort which looks worth mentioning (not much usage over entire year, but ramped up from nothing to 12k hours / week in the last month)
   * [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=engage][Engage]] has significant usage also (average 8k, peak 45k)
   * VOs which have non-trivial amounts of usage (but perhaps not enough to highlight individually): [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=sdss][sdss]], [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=gpn][gpn]], [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=nanohub][nanohub]], [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=mipp][mipp]], [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_overview?vo=hypercp][hypercp]].

We need another VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo overview page which shows what percentage of each LHC VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is represented by the T1 site.

---++ TODO/progress:
   1. [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_opp][Opportunistic usage plots]] - Initial attempts online.  Need to refine site ownership definitions.
   1. [[http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/xml/gridscan_quality][GridScan results graph]] - Online.
   1. WLCG availability for CMS and ATLAS OSG sites - SAM DB?
   1. Number of slots available in GIP - Can be live data.
   1. Hits on the website / twiki - Contacted Anne H / Rob Q.  Not available for whole year; investigating.  OSG website has webalizer graphs.
   1. [[https://t2.unl.edu:8444/vo_exitcode][VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo usage of the OSG group by job exit code]] - Chris Green has built an one-off summary table
   1. Downloads of OSG and VDT cache - Alain provided Excel spreadsheet.
