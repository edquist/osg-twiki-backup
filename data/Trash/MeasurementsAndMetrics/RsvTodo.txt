Since the v1 release of RSV Reports, we are collecting the TODO list here; this will be the contents of the next release (or maintenance release)
   * Include the number of RSV results which made it into RSV during the month, but not into SAM. 
   * Include a list of all the sites which have precisely 0% availability. 
   * Include a list of all the sites which have precisely 100% availability.
   * Fix rounding error in the CMS/ATLAS daily resource report
