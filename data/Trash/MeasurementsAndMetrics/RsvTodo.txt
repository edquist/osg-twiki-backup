Since the v1 release of RSV Reports, we are collecting the TODO list here; this will be the contents of the next release (or maintenance release)
   * Include the number of RSV results which made it into RSV during the month, but not into SAM (of course, this only applies to serviceUris which should be reporting to SAM). 
   * Include a list of all the sites which have precisely 0% availability. 
   * Include a list of all the sites which have precisely 100% availability. 
   * Fix rounding error in the CMS/ATLAS daily resource report 
   * Split the osg-sites report WLCG table into separate ATLAS and CMS tables.
