This page is a sandbox for issues which may be holding up the collection of measurements:

Long-term issues:
   * Deploy dCache probe on OSG sites : Priority from RP: High
   * Integrate automated measurements with the OIM DB.  : Priority from RP: High
   * Gratia is not queryable without locking the DB - i.e., if I do a large query which takes 10 minutes, the DB is out of commission for all users for 10 minutes. :  Priority from RP: High
   * Compare usage reported by VO's monitoring tools to that reported by Gratia - and make it agree!  : Priority from RP: Low

Short-term issues:
   * dCache probe does not report VO information :  Priority from RP: High
   * Get WBS from Gratia; make sure that their twiki is updated with their current plans. :  Priority from RP: High
   * dCache-transfer probe does not record remote site name - only remote host name.  This makes tracking transfers from point A to point B impossible. :  Priority from RP: Medium
   * Deploy  :  Priority from RP: High


Gratia DB issues:
   * Gratia proposal includes aggregating information monthly for the last year; we need to aggregate weekly for a year, monthly after a year. :  Priority from RP: Medium
   * Gratia DB performance is way, way below (2 orders of magnitude) that of a stock server at UNL.  Why?
