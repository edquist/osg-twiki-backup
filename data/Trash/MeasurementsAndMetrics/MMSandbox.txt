This page is a sandbox for issues which may be holding up the collection of measurements:

Long-term issues:
   * Deploy dCache probe on OSG sites
   * Integrate automated measurements with the OIM DB.
   * Gratia is not queryable without locking the DB - i.e., if I do a large query which takes 10 minutes, the DB is out of commission for all users for 10 minutes.
   * Compare usage reported by VO's monitoring tools to that reported by Gratia - and make it agree!

Short-term issues:
   * dCache probe does not report VO information
   * Get WBS from Gratia; make sure that their twiki is updated with their current plans.
   * dCache-transfer probe does not record remote site name - only remote host name.  This makes tracking transfers from point A to point B impossible.
   * Deploy 

Gratia DB issues:
   * Gratia proposal includes aggregating information monthly for the last year; we need to aggregate weekly for a year, monthly after a year.
   * Gratia DB performance is way, way below (2 orders of magnitude) that of a stock server at UNL.  Why?

If this page hasn't been edited in more than a week, it has most likely been abandoned.
