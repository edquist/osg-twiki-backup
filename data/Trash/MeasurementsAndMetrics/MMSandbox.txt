This page is a sandbox for issues which may be holding up the collection of measurements:
|*Issue*|*Status*|*Priority*|*Completion Target Date*|*Last update*|
|*Long-term issues:*|||||
|Deploy dCache probe on OSG sites|Packaged by Gratia team; waiting on OSG storage packaging.  Will assist Neha while Chris Green is on furlough.|High|Unknown|5 Feb 2008|
|Integrate automated measurements with the OIM DB.|Waiting on OIM access, which Rob Q doesn't want to give.  Needs attention from Brian to determine status.|High|Unknown|5 Feb 2008|
|Gratia is not queryable without locking the DB - i.e., if I do a large query which takes 10 minutes, the DB is out of commission for all users for 10 minutes.|Need to talk with Gratia team about what exactly I can and cannot query in the meantime.|High|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|Compare usage reported by VO's monitoring tools to that reported by Gratia - and make it agree! |Done for USATLAS; needs to be done for USCMS and compare data.|Low|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|GIP data for CPU count that we can rely on.|Burt has been made aware of this issue.  Participating in bugfixes and packaging of the GIP.  We are currently recording the GIP output in a UNL database, and will analyze the data when more is available.  We should be able to get an accurate count for most large sites.|Unknown|Unknown|6 Feb 2008|
|Automated monthly report for funding agency|Ruth will be making a rough draft for February, will participate more when this is done.|Unknown|Unknown|5 Feb 2008|
|*Short-term issues:*|||||
|dCache probe does not report VO information|Greg and Chris gave Brian an updated probe; after a few fixes, I got it working locally.  Greg will commit and Chris will re-roll RPMs.  Working at Nebraska.|High|1 Feb 2008|29 Jan 2008|
|Get WBS from Gratia; make sure that their twiki is updated with their current plans.|There appears to be some minor outlines at http://gratia.sf.net, but not much.|High|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|dCache-transfer probe does not record remote site name - only remote host name.  This makes tracking transfers from point A to point B impossible.|Greg Sharp is aware of this; after a few email exchanges, perhaps the best way to accomplish this is to have an entry in the OIM database.  Remote hostname will be converted to sitename based upon a regexp the site admin provides (i.e., cms*.fnal.gov -> USCMS_FNAL).  OIM will record this; not currently deployed.  Will work once OIM comes online.|Medium|Unknown|5 Feb 2008|
|Deploy GraphTool based accounting graphs.|Need to packaging something which can be handed over to Rob Q.|High|11 Feb 2008|5 Feb 2008|
|Deliver updated set of requirements for the accounting system to the Gratia team|Preliminary document finished.  The remaining issues are:  <ul>\
   <li>Have Security Officer check security requirements over.  Contacted Mine Altunay, waiting on response.</li> \
   <li> From RP "can [you develop a] formulae for what is accounting given a Resource and a User and a "Piece of Work Done". One would need to define Piece of Work Done for use of a storage resource - with the persistence and retention issues". </li>\
   <li> Need to update the retention policy with one developed previously.  RP will forward an email. </li>\
   <li> Rob Q needs to update me with the accounting requirements from the VO stakeholders. </li>\
   <li> Summarize into bulletpoints for the OSG EB.  Done.  Uploaded to OSG DocDB.</li>\
   <li> Differentiate new and changed requirements from unchanged requirements. </li></ul>\
|High|30 Jan 2008|5 Feb 2008|
|Summarize accounting requirements for EB.|Done|High|Feb 8 2008|Feb 5 2008|
|Write up baseline metrics into document.|Needs attention|Unknown|Feb 11 2008|Feb 5 2008|
|Follow up on WLCG accounting needs|Needs attention|Unknown|Unknown|Feb 5 2008|
|Assist and coordinate with D0 on any Gratia needs.|Waiting for info from D0|Unknown|Unknown|6 Feb 2008|
|Understand what ATLAS data exists in APEL and Gratia|Will be updated by RP.|Unknown|Unknown|6 Feb 2008|

Gratia DB issues:
   * Gratia proposal includes aggregating information monthly for the last year; we need to aggregate weekly for a year, monthly after a year. :  Priority from RP: Medium
<!--   * Gratia DB performance is way, way below (2 orders of magnitude) that of a stock server at UNL.  Why? :  Priority from RP: High -->
   * The VOProbeSummary table is way too large because it records probename, not the sitename.  Brought this up on OSG-accounting list, we think we've found a solution (misconfiguration of glExec probe at FNAL).
   * Based on solution above, we need to drop a lot of information out of the summary tables.  Follow up and make sure it has been done.


If this page hasn't been edited in more than a week, it has most likely been abandoned.
