This page is a sandbox for issues which may be holding up the collection of measurements:
|*Issue*|*Status*|*Priority*|*Completion Target Date*|*Last update*|

|Deploy dCache probe on OSG sites|Packaged by Gratia team; waiting on OSG storage packaging.|High|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|Integrate automated measurements with the OIM DB.|Waiting on OIM access.|High|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|Gratia is not queryable without locking the DB - i.e., if I do a large query which takes 10 minutes, the DB is out of commission for all users for 10 minutes.|Need to talk with Gratia team about what exactly I can and cannot query in the meantime.|High|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|Compare usage reported by VO's monitoring tools to that reported by Gratia - and make it agree! |Done for USATLAS; needs to be done for USCMS and compare data.|Low|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|GIP data for CPU count that we can rely on.|Burt has been made aware of this issue.|Unknown|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
| _From RP: Could you please do some technical work here in terms of giving me a report of what information now exists and what it will take to get good information if you were to work on getting it to happen. So I would ask you to contribute here... |||| Jan 26_|

|Automated monthly report for funding agency|Needs attention|Unknown|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|*Short-term issues:*|||||
|dCache probe does not report VO information|Greg and Chris gave Brian an updated probe; after a few fixes, I got it working locally.  Greg will commit and Chris will re-roll RPMs.|High|1 Feb 2008|29 Jan 2008|
|Get WBS from Gratia; make sure that their twiki is updated with their current plans.|Needs attention|High|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|dCache-transfer probe does not record remote site name - only remote host name.  This makes tracking transfers from point A to point B impossible.|Greg Sharp is aware of this; after a few email exchanges, perhaps the best way to accomplish this is to have an entry in the OIM database.  Remote hostname will be converted to sitename based upon a regexp the site admin provides (i.e., cms*.fnal.gov -> USCMS_FNAL).  In discussions with the OIM folk.|Medium|Unknown|29 Jan 2008|
|Deploy GraphTool based accounting graphs.|Can this wait until the OIM webpage beta or so?|High|Unkown|25 Jan 2008|
|Determine the data needed in the monthly reports for funding agency.|Needs attention|Unknown|Unknown|25 Jan 2008|
|Deliver updated set of requirements for the accounting system to the Gratia team|Work in progress.  Needs input from Ruth|High|30 Jan 2008|27 Jan 2008| 


Gratia DB issues:
   * Gratia proposal includes aggregating information monthly for the last year; we need to aggregate weekly for a year, monthly after a year. :  Priority from RP: Medium
   * Gratia DB performance is way, way below (2 orders of magnitude) that of a stock server at UNL.  Why? :  Priority from RP: High
   * The VOProbeSummary table is way too large because it records probename, not the sitename.


If this page hasn't been edited in more than a week, it has most likely been abandoned.
