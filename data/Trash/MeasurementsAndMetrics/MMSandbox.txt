Un-sorted issues from Ruth:
   * Mechanism for adding notes to the WLCG accounting reports.
   * Add an accounting page for LIGO, like the LHC pages.
      * weekly / monthly reports.
   * Add an accounting page for LHC T3s

Things Brian would like to work on:
   * Add RSV availability to WLCG accounting page
   * Static reports for storage information from Gratia.

This page is a sandbox for issues which may be holding up the collection of measurements:
|*Issue*|*Status*|*Priority*|*Completion Target Date*|*Last update*|
|Deploy dCache probe on OSG sites|Fully handed off to OSG storage.  Probes appear ready to deploy.|High|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|Integrate automated measurements with the OIM DB.|Got OIM access.  Looking at schema.|High|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|Compare usage reported by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's monitoring tools to that reported by Gratia - and make it agree! |Wrote summary probes for CMS and LIGO.  Currently integrating into summary collector.|Low|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|Automated monthly report for funding agency|Waiting on WLCG accounting for April reports.  Need to determine metric for May|Unknown|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|dCache-transfer probe does not record remote site name - only remote host name.  This makes tracking transfers from point A to point B impossible.|Waiting on OIM so we can map from hostname -> storage site name.|Medium|Unknown|12 Mar 2008|
|Deploy GraphTool based accounting graphs.|Needs attention - where do we deploy this?  Ready to go.|High|15 Apr 2008|15 May 2008|
|Write up baseline metrics into document.|Done.  Waiting on EB feedback|Unknown|15 Feb 2008|15 May 2008|

|Understand what ATLAS data exists in APEL and Gratia|I don't understand what actions are needed|Unknown|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|Site normalization constants from GIP|Karthik (ATLAS) is investigating this and will report to WLCG.  Watch and wait.|Unknown|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|Create a site capacity metric for DOE reports|Waiting on ATLAS sites to OK the site normalization work, which is a dependency of this.|Unknown|Unknown|15 May 2008|
|RSV Daily OSG Reports| Second implementation done.  Waiting on more feedback.|High|Unknown|27 May 2008|
