Un-sorted issues from Ruth:
   * RSV Reports need shorter column width.  The # of resources don't match in 2 different places of the emails
      * From Brian: It appears the HTML and plain-text versions don't agree on historical.  Need to finish v2
      * From Brian (May 27).  Issue is fixed in v2.
   * Add commas "," into the WLCG accounting reports.  Clarify column headers.  A few other details in email from May 18
      * From Brian (May 27).  Issue fixed in v2.
   * Mechanism for adding notes to the WLCG accounting reports.

Things Brian would like to work on:
   * Add RSV availability to WLCG accounting page
   * Create page listing CPU -> SI2K mappings.
   * Static reports for storage information from Gratia.
