Gratia DB issues:
   * Gratia proposal includes aggregating information monthly for the last year; we need to aggregate weekly for a year, monthly after a year. :  Priority from RP: Medium
   * Gratia DB performance is way, way below (2 orders of magnitude) that of a stock server at UNL.  Why? :  Priority from RP: High


If this page hasn't been edited in more than a week, it has most likely been abandoned.
