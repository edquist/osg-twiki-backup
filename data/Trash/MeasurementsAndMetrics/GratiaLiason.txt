The metrics and measurements area is in charge of being the liason between the OSG and the external Gratia project.

This page is meant to be a "virtual post-it", a record of the ongoing requests from the OSG to Gratia.  This is updated during the weekly Gratia meeting (every Wednesday).

Gratia Tasks (Prioritized)
   * Status and stability issues with DB optimization and housekeeping identified during summer 2010.
   * Evaluate impact of new CE interfaces - CREAM.
   * HTPC probes.
   * Improved accounting for VO pilot frameworks.
   * SLURM probes for Gratia.  May be externally contributed, but it would take Gratia effort to coordinate.
   * Improve the automation of the Gratia Testing framework and work with the VDT team on including this in the nightly build/tests as far as possible.

Interesting, but not active Gratia tasks (not prioritized):
   * Add a layer to allow forwarding of summary data instead of raw data.
      * Possibly do aggregating by collector-side probes?
   * Pass GIP output from Gratia
   * Allow data from single probe to be delivered to multiple collectors
   * Ensure clean and clear separation of code modules  between "Gratia, the job accounting system" and "Gratia, the data transport".
   * Probe maintenance and packaging:
      * Mitigate issues related to log rotation in the Probe that do log scrapping (SunGrid Engine, PBS, LSF, glexec).
      * Make probes run non-root.
      * Make probes compatible with RHEL file system layout.
   * Evaluate impact of new CE interfaces - GRAM5.

Non-Gratia accounting tasks

   * Storage Accounting: Addition of a POSIX probe for storage accounting.
