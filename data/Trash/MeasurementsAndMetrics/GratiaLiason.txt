The metrics and measurements area is in charge of being the liason between the OSG and the external Gratia project.

This page is meant to be a "virtual post-it", a record of the ongoing requests from the OSG to Gratia.  This is updated during the weekly Gratia meeting (every Wednesday).

Gratia Tasks:
   * VO Reports: Last check, 3 people still needed to be registered in OIM.  This was as of April 29
      * This is required from http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=808.  Appears to be done?
      * Done.
   * Transfer reports:
      * Requirements given to Chris.  On May 6, statement was transfer reporting was 5 calendar weeks away (June 10-ish?).
      * Possibly will have Karthik look at this.
      * May 13, statement was 5 weeks away.
   * BOINC Probe: Headed up by Clemson.  No news is good news!
   * Upload DN to WLCG
      * John W progressing with John Gordon's team
      * Philippe will implement DN in tables in Gratia 1.04 (?)
      * STG requirement 35
   * Gratia 1.04 delayed for 3 weeks as of May 6.  Working on security implementation.
      * Q: Does this include 
   * Storage Accounting: Karthik is investigating.  Brian has something started for the collector
      * Stakeholder requirement (CMS).  Overdue
   * STG requirement 22: Not done, not being worked on.  Push back on the STG
   * STG requirement 25, 29, 30: Document the fact this is done.
   * Gratia RSV probe -- handed off to GOC, waiting on Arvind to adopt it to RSV v3.  No progress for quite awhile.

Notes:
   * Gratia made these following requirements on OIM; uploaded Dec 2008:  http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=809
   * May 20 meeting:
      * 1.04 release is waiting on http_proxy improvements for the probes.
      * BNL transfer probe is on March 7 today
      * Gratia RSV probe has been waiting on Arvind for very long time.
      * Slow progress on WLCG DN reporting: but forward progress
      * Discussed OSG Storage Requirements.  Have an idea
