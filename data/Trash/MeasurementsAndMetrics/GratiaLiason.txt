The metrics and measurements area is in charge of being the liason between the OSG and the external Gratia project.

This page is meant to be a "virtual post-it", a record of the ongoing requests from the OSG to Gratia.  This is updated during the weekly Gratia meeting (every Wednesday).

Gratia Tasks:
   * Gratia 1.06 - feature freeze Sept 9, release Sept 21.
   * Transfer reports:
      * Requirements given to Chris.  On May 6, statement was transfer reporting was 5 calendar weeks away (June 10-ish?).
      * Possibly will have Karthik look at this.
   * Storage reports:
      * Not sure of status, not sure of effort.
   * BOINC Probe: Headed up by Clemson.  No news is bad news!
      * Waiting on Condor 7.3.2, then check on Sebastien again.
   * Upload DN to WLCG
      * John W progressing with John Gordon's team
      * STG requirement 35.
         * Needs to contact STG
      * John Hover is working on this.  Has stated he's on target for 1.06 feature freeze target date.
   * Storage Accounting: Implemented at the collector side - updates are about ready to be committed for Gratia 1.06.
      * Running in test collector at Nebraska.
      * Collecting data with BDII probe.
      * Need effort to integrate with site admin tools.
      * Stakeholder requirement (CMS).  Overdue.
   * STG requirement 22: Not done, not being worked on.  Push back on the STG
   * Gratia RSV probe -- handed off to GOC.  In the code, but not currently well-deployed.  More work is needed to make GOC happy, I believe.
   * Gratia 1.04 does not include http proxy support, as *might* be required by BNL.  This requires deep hacking into the Python urllib; if BNL needs it, they will need to contribute this due to the amount of effort.
   * Metrics and Measurements status data in Gratia:
      * Year 4 deliverable for M&M - updates should be ready for collector for 1.06.
   * CMS requested that we be able to distinguish jobs removed in Condor with the PeriodicRemove expression be reported as failed jobs (currently, they are listed as successful).
      * Asked Gratia team on September 1 to put this as a high priority update for v1.06.

Notes:
   * Gratia made these following requirements on OIM; uploaded Dec 2008:  http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=809
