---+ Measurements and Metrics Graphing

Metrics and Measurements provides a web graphing system designed for experts to pull data out of the Gratia system and other data sources.  It is based upon !GraphTool.

---+++ Install Directions
   * [[http://t2.unl.edu/documentation/graphtool/new-install][Install !GraphTool]]
   * Follow the directions on the page above to install the !MySQL and SQLite bindings
   * Download the attached Python Egg to your home directory
   * Create the ~/dbinfo directory and contact Brian to get the DB auth files from him.
   * Launch the webserver:
      <verbatim>sh dist/OSG_Gratia_Viewer-0.1-py2.3.egg</verbatim>
   * When running the webserver, you probably want to either run it in a separate screen instance or run it under =nohup=, and redirect the output to a log file.
