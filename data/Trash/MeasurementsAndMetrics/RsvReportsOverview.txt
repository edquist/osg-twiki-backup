---+ RSV Reporting Overview

This page is an overview of the RSV reporting effort. This effort is a combination of work from the WLCG, OSG GOC, and the OSG Metrics and Measurements group. We have the following goals:
   * Help site administrators understand the test results from their site. 
   * Provide the OSG executive team with information about the OSG facility's status. 
   * Compare and align measurements made by the OSG and those made by the WLCG 

The mechanism we implement these goals with is daily reports published via email (text-only) and [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/daily-reports/][archived online (HTML)]]. These email reports combine information from WLCG, the RSV database, and configuration files. [[RsvReports][The process for installing the reports is documented here]]. These are run automatically by the GOC.

One of the key algorithms we use to evaluate sites is the WLCG availability algorithm. Based on the RSV data, [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/RsvEquivalency#Critical_Tests_for_OSG_Resources][a list of availability metrics for each service]], and [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu/pub/maintenance/show.php][downtime information from OIM]], the WLCG availability algorithm produces two numbers for a given time interval: the availability and reliability.

The availability is designed to measure the percentage of time that the entity was functioning for users; the reliability is designed to measure the percentage of time that the entity was functioning _out of the scheduled availability_ (i.e., the times when the entity wasn't under maintenance). Here, an "entity" can be one of three things:
   * Service: A set of functionalities provided to an end-user by a resource. 
   * Site: A logical set of resources providing various services (most often, a combination of a SE and CE). 
   * Federation: A single site or group of sites even which have entered in the WLCG !MoU as a single entity.
