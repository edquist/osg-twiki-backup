---++ WLCG-related Metrics

The OSG, on behalf of the USLHC VOs, collects several different metrics each month and delivers this data through various means to the WLCG.

This page attempts to define what metrics are collected, how data is collected, and who the data is delivered to, as well as various relevant links.

The three main areas which we are interested in monthly are job accounting, service availability, and installed capacity
