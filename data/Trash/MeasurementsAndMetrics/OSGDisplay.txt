The OSG Display is currently in alpha / draft form and is liable to change.  The current link is here:

   * http://dev.grid.iu.edu/~hayashis/osg/index.php

This means that it might be done currently or not render on your browser at all.

To install the data package to generate the server-side plots, do the following:

   * Install the MS core fonts as described here: http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/; the OSG Display RPM will depend on the resulting msttcorefonts package.  In the US, it is permissible to install using the above method, but not to redistribute; this is why this is a separate step.
   * <verbatim>rpm -i http://t2.unl.edu/store/rpms/matplotlib-0.99.1.1-1.x86_64.rpm</verbatim>.  Note that this version of matplotlib is currently incompatible with the one that GraphTool requires.
   * <verbatim>rpm -i http://t2.unl.edu/store/rpms/OSG_Display_Data-0.1-1.noarch.rpm</verbatim>. 

This automatically sets up a cron job (the osg_display script itself includes an automatic timer so the OS kills it after 100 seconds) to generate the required images and data.  Writes are handled atomically, so it should not be possible to encounter a partially-updated graph.

Logs are written to /var/log/osg_display.  The entire update procedure can be manually triggered by running =/usr/bin/osg_display=.  I recommend to run this at least once the first time you install it to verify everything works.
