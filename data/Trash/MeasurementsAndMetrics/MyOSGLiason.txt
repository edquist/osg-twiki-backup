---++ !MyOSG Liason Activities

This page outlines the Metrics and Measurements team's activities as a liason between the OSG and the !MyOSG external software project

---+++ Requests for !MyOSG from OSG

   1 For each XML view, additionally have a CSV view which can be imported into Excel.
      * This is blocking OSG management from actually using this data!
      * Tabled for 1 more week on 16 Sept; waiting on Rob Q to try something out.
   1 Target for Sept 30: A MyOSG roadmap.
   1 Remove Bestman/Xrootd checkbox in !MyOSG/OIM
      * Sent message to RSV-SAM; waiting to hear back from WLCG folks as to the impact on their side.
      * Plan agreed to by OSG; this is in-progress.
   1 Put together an architectural diagram document, describing the overall !MyOSG architecture
      * Put together a !MyOSG roadmap that the OSG can follow along.
      * Document put together by Soichi; needs to be written as a Word doc and uploaded to DocDB.
   1 ATLAS Request for a Google Calendar compatible downtime list.
      * Gave ATLAS the current URL, no feedback yet.  Delivered in MyOSG 1.7, waiting on feedback.
   1 OSG Management request for a "presentation quality" status map.
      * Lots of input from Jim Weichel
      * Need an algorithm which does not overlap either dots or labels
      * Need better algorithms to decide the icon used in the status map (checkmark, red X, or question mark).  Too many question marks.
      * Something new was delivered in 1.7; present to Ruth, Paul, and Jim and see what they think.  Doing more would be costly.
   1 Change management request.  Give Jemise Lockhart a page where she can view when a VO is added, removed, or updated and a site is added, removed, or updated.
      * Once this is complete, Metrics and Measurements would like a similar page in order to view whenever someone has edited WLCG-related information
      * Ruth may have access now; working to get Jemise and Brian access.
   1 Import GIP information.
   1 Integrate graphs from metrics and measurements.  This is delayed until about November 1, as it is a part of Metrics and Measurements WBS for Year 4.

---+++ Completed Requests
   1 Update OSG Blueprint document to reflect current terminology - uploaded to DocDB and sent to EB.
   1 !MyOSG 1.6 and 1.7 update - anything break?  Any complaints?
      * No Complaints, all looks good.  Positive feedback.
   1 JIRA account for the liason (to be decided if GOC purchases a JIRA license).  Waiting on GOC activity.
      * Done as of 9/16; tracker.grid.iu.edu;
