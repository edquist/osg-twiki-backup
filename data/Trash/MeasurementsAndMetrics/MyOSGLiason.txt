---++ !MyOSG Liason Activities

This page outlines the Metrics and Measurements team's activities as a liason between the OSG and the !MyOSG external software project

---+++ Requests for !MyOSG from OSG

   1 For each XML view, additionally have a CSV view which can be imported into Excel.
      * This is blocking OSG management from actually using this data!
   1 OSG Management request for a "presentation quality" status map.
      * Lots of input from Jim Weichel
      * Need an algorithm which does not overlap either dots or labels
      * Need better algorithms to decide the icon used in the status map (checkmark, red X, or question mark).  Too many question marks.
   1 Put together an architectural diagram document, describing the overall !MyOSG architecture
      * Put together a !MyOSG roadmap that the OSG can follow along.
      * Document put together by Soichi; needs to be written as a Word doc and uploaded to DocDB.
   1 ATLAS Request for a Google Calendar compatible downtime list.
      * Gave ATLAS the current URL, no feedback yet.
   1 Change management request.  Give Jemise Lockhart a page where she can view when a VO is added, removed, or updated and a site is added, removed, or updated.
      * Once this is complete, Metrics and Measurements would like a similar page in order to view whenever someone has edited WLCG-related information
      * Any updates?
   1 !MyOSG update - anything break?  Any complaints?
   1 JIRA account for the liason (to be decided if GOC purchases a JIRA license).  Waiting on GOC activity.
   1 Remove Bestman/Xrootd checkbox in !MyOSG/OIM
      * Sent message to RSV-SAM; waiting to hear back from WLCG folks as to the impact on their side.
   1 (TODO) Discuss the case of multiple SRM endpoints on the same resource.  Does something need to be done in registration?
   1 Import GIP information.
   1 Integrate graphs from metrics and measurements.  This is delayed until about November 1, as it is a part of Metrics and Measurements WBS for Year 4.

   1 Update OSG Blueprint document to reflect current terminology - uploaded to DocDB and sent to EB.
