---++ !MyOSG Liason Activities

This page outlines the Metrics and Measurements team's activities as a liason between the OSG and the !MyOSG external software project

---+++ Requests for !MyOSG from OSG

   1 Put together an architectural diagram document, describing the overall !MyOSG architecture
      * Put together a !MyOSG roadmap that the OSG can follow along.
   1 JIRA account for the liason (to be decided if GOC purchases a JIRA license)
   1 OSG Management request for a "presentation quality" status map.
   1 ATLAS Request for a Google Calendar compatible downtime list.
   1 !MyOSG update - anything break?  Any complaints?
   1 Remove Bestman/Xrootd checkbox in !MyOSG/OIM
   1 Change management request.  Give Jemise Lockhart a page where she can view when a VO is added, removed, or updated and a site is added, removed, or updated.
      * Once this is complete, Metrics and Measurements would like a similar page in order to view whenever someone has edited WLCG-related information
   1 (TODO) Discuss the case of multiple SRM endpoints on the same resource.  Does something need to be done in registration?
   1 Import GIP information
   1 Integrate graphs from metrics and measurements.  This is delayed until about November 1, as it is a part of Metrics and Measurements WBS for Year 4.

---+++ Requests for OSG from !MyOSG
   1 Update OSG Blueprint document to reflect current terminology.
