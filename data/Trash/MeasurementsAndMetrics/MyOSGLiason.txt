---++ !MyOSG Liason Activities

This page outlines the Metrics and Measurements team's activities as a liason between the OSG and the !MyOSG external software project

---+++ Requests for !MyOSG from OSG

   1 Add time-filtering for past OIM downtimes in order to not receive previous ones.
   1 Start thinking about downtimes for sites and contacts for sites that then propagate to the correct resources.
   1 Target for Sept 30: A MyOSG roadmap.  Moved to Oct 21.
   1 Put together an architectural diagram document, describing the overall !MyOSG architecture
      * Put together a !MyOSG roadmap that the OSG can follow along.
      * Document put together by Soichi; needs to be written as a Word doc and uploaded to DocDB.
   1 Publish officially supported stable schema document and an API for querying.
   1 OSG Management request for a "presentation quality" status map.
      * Lots of input from Jim Weichel
      * Need an algorithm which does not overlap either dots or labels
      * Need better algorithms to decide the icon used in the status map (checkmark, red X, or question mark).  Too many question marks.
      * Something new was delivered in 1.7; present to Ruth, Paul, and Jim and see what they think.  Doing more would be costly.
   1 Change management request.  Give Jemise Lockhart a page where she can view when a VO is added, removed, or updated and a site is added, removed, or updated.
      * Once this is complete, Metrics and Measurements would like a similar page in order to view whenever someone has edited WLCG-related information
      * Ruth may have access now; working to get Jemise and Brian access.
   1 Import GIP information.
   1 Integrate graphs from metrics and measurements.  This is delayed until about November 1, as it is a part of Metrics and Measurements WBS for Year 4.

---+++ Completed Requests
   1 Update OSG Blueprint document to reflect current terminology - uploaded to DocDB and sent to EB.
   1 !MyOSG 1.6 and 1.7 update - anything break?  Any complaints?
      * No Complaints, all looks good.  Positive feedback.
   1 JIRA account for the liason (to be decided if GOC purchases a JIRA license).  Waiting on GOC activity.
      * Done as of 9/16; tracker.grid.iu.edu; 
   1 Need 6 month stability promise for Resource Downtime information.  DONE
   1 SCHEDULED versus UNSCHEDULED downtime handling.  Are we following this document correctly: https://edms.cern.ch/file/829986/0.1/WLCG-scheduled-maintenance-May15.pdf ?
      * Result: OSG Executive Board declared that this kind of handling is not needed
      * From the GOCDB folks:
         * Cannot declare unscheduled downtimes starting less that NOW-24h
         * Cannot declare scheduled downtimes starting less than NOW+24h
         * Previously declared downtimes can have their end time brought forward to NOW
         * Un-scheduled downtimes may be declared up to 24 hours in the past. This will be purely to inform the user community, but the “reason” field will appear in the future EGEE Companion report.
   1 For each XML view, additionally have a CSV view which can be imported into Excel.
      * Done in MyOSG 1.9
      * This is blocking OSG management from actually using this data!
      * Tabled for 1 more week on 16 Sept; waiting on Rob Q to try something out.
   1 Remove Bestman/Xrootd checkbox in !MyOSG/OIM.  DONE
      * Sent message to RSV-SAM; waiting to hear back from WLCG folks as to the impact on their side.
      * Plan agreed to by OSG; this is in-progress.
   1 ATLAS Request for a Google Calendar compatible downtime list.  DONE
      * Gave ATLAS the current URL, no feedback yet.  Delivered in MyOSG 1.7, waiting on feedback.
      * Feedback gotten.  No complaints.
