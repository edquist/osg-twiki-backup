---+ Year Two Metrics

The metrics for year two are broken down into three categories:
   * Open: Metrics which show that the OSG is involving and including the user community and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo stakeholders.  This includes a focus on both the "traditional" HEP VOs and non-HEP VOs.
   * Science: Metrics focusing on showing that the OSG enables VOs to produce science.
   * Grid: Traditional metrics about the grid's performance.

---+++ "Open" Metrics
In this section, we want to define metrics which reflect how the OSG is involving and enabling an open community of scientists.
   * User satisfaction.
   * Tickets resolved for end-users.
   * Tickets resolved for sites.
   * OSG education effort success.
As these metrics involve users and measuring partly subjective data, these will be the hardest to strictly define and measure.

---+++ "Science" Metrics
The metrics in this section are driven by the goals and needs of the VOs
   * Help 6 out of 8 HEP VOs achieve their science goals.  The HEP VOs are LIGO, ATLAS, CMS, STAR, CDF, D0, SDSS, and CMS
   * Assist 4 non-HEP VOs in defining science goals and achieve at least 2.
These metrics will require participation and feedback from VOs.

---+++ "Grid" Metrics
These are traditional grid metrics, relating to the computing and maintenance of the OSG.
   * Number of distinct facilities passing the site verify tests.  Should average 60 / month.
   * Average >1GB/s of data transferred throughout the grid over a week.
   * Average >1PB / month of data transfer volume.
   * Average 100,000 jobs a day for a week and 75,000 jobs a day over a month.
   * Have 30,000 CPUs available
   * Have a 85% grid efficiency on the OSG.
These are among the easiest metrics to measure as they can be taken from accounting and monitoring; however, we need to do a better job of "automating" the measurement.
