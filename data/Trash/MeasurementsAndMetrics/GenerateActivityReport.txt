Procedure for generating monthly Tier 2 Activity Report:

An example report is attached to this page as a Word document.  This can be used as a template for generating future reports.

Monthly data is available at http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/jot_reporting.  Ideally, generating the report largely involves simply transcribing the data on the JOT page into the Word template.   The only data not on the JOT page are the HEPSPEC and Storage figures.  These numbers can be obtained in two different manners.  

First, they are available on the WLCG REBUS page at http://wlcg-rebus.cern.ch/apps/capacities/federations/.  This is generally the most convenient source, as the figures are summed and grouped by Federation name.  Secondly, per-resource figures are on the OIM page at https://oim.grid.iu.edu/oim/resource.  The WLCG figures should simply be the sum of the OIM per-resource figures grouped by accounting name.  Occasionally, the WCLG figures may conflict with the OIM sum figure – generally speaking, the OIM values are considered authoritative.  It should be noted that the WLCG Accounting Name does not directly correspond to the WCLG Federation Name.  For convenience, a table of the mapping is provided below. They may also be obtained from http://wlcg-rebus.cern.ch/apps/topology.

| *Federation Name* | *Accounting Name* |
| *ATLAS* | |
| Great Lakes ATLAS T2 | US-AGLT2 |
| Midwest ATLAS T2 | US-MWT2 |
| Northeast ATLAS T2 | US-NET2 |
| Southwest ATLAS T2 | US-SWT2 |
| SLAC ATLAS T2 | US-WT2 |
| *CMS*| |
| Caltech CMS T2 | T2_US_Caltech |
| Florida CMS T2 | T2_US_Florida |
| MIT CMS T2 | T2_US_MIT |
| Nebraska CMS T2  | T2_US_Nebraska |
| Purdue CMS T2 | T2_US_Purdue |
| UC San Diego CMS T2 | T2_US_UCSD | 
| U. Wisconsin CMS T2 | T2_US_Wisconsin|


It should be noted that the WLCG publishes separate Accounting and Reliability/Availability reports that contain much of the same information as this report.  These reports are available on the WLCG document repository at http://www.cern.ch/wlcg-docs under the “Tier-2” subsections of the “Accounting” and “Reliability-Availability” sections.  Ideally, the figures in these reports should match the JOT numbers.  One caveat is that the WCLG tracks CPU hours only, as opposed to both CPU and Wallclock hours here.  It’s generally good practice to compare to these reports, even if none of the figures are particularly off.

If any of the figures look out of the ordinary, there are a few steps to take.  First, compare to the WLCG numbers.  If the suspect figure differs, it’s likely the error is due to a reporting issue somewhere and not an actual problem at a site.  If one of the Reliability or Availability percentages is the issue, the MyOSG site (http://myosg.grid.iu.edu) is useful to check the availability history and downtime information of the site.  Similarly, excessive downtime may cause a site’s CPU hours to be lower as well.  

There are periods when demand for resources are lower – during these periods the “CPU hours for Owner VO” may drop below the pledge amounts.  This is usually fairly apparent, as all sites will have usage either near or below pledge amount.  The Wallclock hours given to other OSG VOs will also generally be quite large, demonstrating that the site was capable of providing the capacity.

For any federation with an abnormal figure, include a brief explanatory note in the monthly specifics section.

The draft version of the report should be mailed to the OSG reports mailing list (osg-wlcg-reports@opensciencegrid.org) by the second Friday of the month.  If there are corrections, send a revised version to the same list.

After any corrections have been made, the report as a PDF should be uploaded to the OSG Document Database at http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/.  The report should be filed under the “Metrics” section with the following example attributes:
