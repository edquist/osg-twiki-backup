---+ Metric for Non HEP Science Usage of the OSG
---++ Introduction
One of the statements in the OSG Charter is, "The Open Science Grid will be open to all sciences that have a need for distributed large scale computing and data management, and can bring resources to be federated."  Two measures of progress on this goal are 1) the number of distinct scientific domains using OSG and 2) the amount (e.g. wallclock hours) of that usage.  This document covers a measure of the usage of scientific domains other than high energy physics (HEP).
