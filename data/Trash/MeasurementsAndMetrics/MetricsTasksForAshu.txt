   * Verify =gip_subcluster_report= (or, preferably, equivalent =bdii_status_record=) is running and verify alerts are issued when it isn't running.
   * Convert GratiaStaticGraphs to use the database directly instead of graph server; similar to RSV-Reports activity in January.
   * Re-validate the monthly thumbnail reports.  Original page from 2008 should be reviewed and cleaned up: MonthlyMetrics.
