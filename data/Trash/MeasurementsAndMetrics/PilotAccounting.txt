---+ OSG Proposal for Pilot and Payload Accounting

---++ Introduction

Using the current accounting system, the OSG has the ability to see only jobs running through the batch system of OSG sites.  Starting during Year 4, there has been increased usage of pilot-based systems.  These systems send in a pilot job to the batch system which is not a scientific payload, but rather downloads user "payload" jobs after it has started and verified the worker node environment is acceptable.  Multiple payload jobs might be run per pilot, and the payload might belong to a user distinct from the pilot (these are also known as Multi-User Pilot Jobs, or MUPJs).  The current OSG accounting system can only record the pilots, not the user jobs.

This document covers the OSG drivers and requirements for the MUPJ accounting, and describes the proposed solution.
