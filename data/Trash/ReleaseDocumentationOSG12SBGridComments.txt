%RED%Hello Peter. We are temporarily filling in. Please keep details posted here. <br> Current focus is only on 5 Persistent ITB sites. Thanks. -- ASR & RWG %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Introduction 

We won't be setting up an ITB site this time around, but I do have plans next week to run some tests against the existing ITB sites.

---++ Known issues

Initial test notes:

Was able to successfully auth against the 5 Persistent ITB sites with an SBGrid voms proxy on Jul 15th.

The filesystem for $OSG_APP on CIT_ITB_1 cit-itb.ultralight.org is currently Read Only.
