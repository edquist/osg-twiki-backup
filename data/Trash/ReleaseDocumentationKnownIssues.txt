---++ Introduction
A list of issues in this current release that have been identified.

---++ OSG 1.2.4
---+++ RSV gums probe
The =org.osg.gums.authorization-status= probe may return an error if an user proxy is being used for rsv.  There is currently no workaround aside from either using a service certificate for rsv or disabling the gums probe.

---+++ SE configuration issues
%NOTE% The non-ce configuration features in configure-osg are still not fully stable, features and options will change between now and the OSG 1.2.5 release.

The =configure-osg= script does has a few issues new configuring bestman configurations.  The following issues exist when configuring SE software using configure-osg:

   * Bestman full mode configurations aren't currently supported.  The Bestman full mode can't be selected currently.
   * Xrootd-fs configuration requires the directory being used as the mount point to exist, the configure_xrootdfs script can create this directory so this check is unncessarily restrictive.
   * Xrootd cache and storage paths are required to be present although the configure scripts will create the directories so this check is also unnecessarily restrictive.
   * The comments for the cache/storage settings in the bestman are switched (this will be corrected in the osg 1.2.5 release).

The issues will be corrected in the OSG 1.2.5 release.
