---+++ Process Introduction
There are three interrelated processes that involve documentation:
   1. Ownership/Review Process
   1. Testing/New Release Process
   1. Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process

Each of these are straightforward and take into account the low resource, collaborative environment of OSG.
The first and third of these processes are owned by the Content Management Area Coordinator who is responsible for maintaining the process descriptions, changing the processes as needed, and managing the execution of the processes with the help of the [[DocArchitectResponsibilities][Documentation Architect]].
The second process is owned and managed by the OSG Integration & Sites Coordinator.

---+++ Ownership/Review Process
Documents are separated into a set of areas, each with an owner that has overall responsibility for that area.  The area owner manages the structure of the area's documentation and ensures the documents have the following roles assigned.
Each document in the official OSG Documentation TWiki must have an Owner who is responsible for creation and/or maintenance/update of that document.
The Owner is named within the document using the OWNER variable.
The responsibilities of the Owner are listed in [[DocOwnerResponsibilities][Document Owner Responsibilities]].

Most documents will also have a Reviewer who is responsible for reviewing the document for content, accuracy, usability, and format.
The Reviewer is named within the document using the REVIEWER variable.
The responsibilities of the Reviewer are listed in [[DocReviewerResponsibilities][Document Reviewer Responsibilities]].

Documents that include procedures to be followed by the readers should also have a Tester who is responsible for testing the procedure to verify that it produces the expected results.  The Tester is named within the document using the TESTER variable.  The Tester responsibilities are listed in [[DocTesterResponsibilities][Document Tester Responsibilities]].

The steps in the Ownership/Review Process apply to all documents in the official OSG Documentation TWiki
(currently Documentation.WebHome and [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][ReleaseDocumentation]]).  
They are:
   1. For any new or existing document (that is not being eliminated), an Owner and Reviewer are identified.  These assignments can be proposed by the Area Owner, made by a person volunteering to take the role (preferred), by local management selection, or  by the Area Owner and/or the Content Management Area Coordinator or Documentation Architect working in conjunction with the person and the person's local management.
   1. The Owner produces or makes the existing document conform to the standards/template (see [[DocClassifications#Document_Types][Document Types]]) and marks the REVIEW_READY variable to %%NOP%YES%.  (The REVIEW_PASSED variable should be %%NOP%IN_PROGRESS%.)
   1. The Reviewer reviews the document and marks the variable REVIEW_PASSED either %%NOP%YES% or %%NOP%NO%.  If NO, then the Reviewer works in collaboration with the Owner to resolve issues with the document until the Reviewer is ready to mark the REVIEW_PASSED variable %%NOP%YES%.
      a. If the document is a procedure or installation document, the Reviewer will mark the TEST_READY variable %%NOP%YES%. (The TEST_PASSED variable should be %%NOP%IN_PROGRESS%.)
      a. The Tester will perform the test, document any problems, and mark the variable TEST_PASSED to %%NOP%YES% (or %%NOP%NO%).
      a. If the test failed, the Tester will collaborate with the Owner to resolve any issues discovered by the testing.  When resolved the Tester will mark the variable TEST_PASSED to %%NOP%YES%.
   1. When the Review and Owner are satisfied with the document, the Reviewer or Owner marks the RELEASE_READY variable to %%NOP%YES%.

Or pictorially:

The list of documents and their owners and reviewers and document status is automatically maintained by the tables that can be created using tools described in DocManagementVariables.  These tables can be generated at various document levels, including Area level, the individual level (all documents the person has a role in), or the Release level (all official documents).

---+++ Testing/New Release Process
This process applies to all documents in the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][ReleaseDocumentation Web]].  When a new release of the OSG software is being integrated, documented, and tested, the Integration & Sites Coordinator manages the process.  That process uses the Owner, Reviewer, and Tester consistent with the Ownership/Review process above.  The management of documents for major and minor releases is detailed in DocReleaseProcess.

---+++ Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process
This process covers the ongoing evaluation and improvement of OSG documentation.  It makes use of user feedback in the form of comments and a document rating mechanism to identify documents or document areas in need of improvement.  In addition the Document Architect and Content Management Area Coordinator may review messages in mailing lists and other information to identify areas needing improvement.

On a quarterly basis, a set of documents will be identified for improvement.  The Owner and Reviewer for each of these will be asked to make improvements that will be tracked by the Document Architect.  At the same time particularly well rated documents will be identified to use as examples of high-quality documents.  Once a year, the best of our documents will be identified and their Owners and Reviewers will be recognized.

%NOTE% The user rating of documents is not yet implemented, so the parts of this section that require those ratings are not currently being done.

---+++ Comments
| Use of a set of boolean variables for the status is quite awkward and ultimately non-descriptive. I suggest using the following states.&#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;Ready to update&#60;br /&#62;Update in progress&#60;br /&#62;Ready to review&#60;br /&#62;Review in progress&#60;br /&#62;Ready to test&#60;br /&#62;Test in progress&#60;br /&#62;Release ready&#60;br /&#62;Released &#60;br /&#62;&#60;br /&#62;It is simpler if a document is in one precise state, rather that some combination of bits. %RED%We are staying with the variables as defined.  This will work in both the case of specific edit->review->test->release sequence as well as other more parallel approaches.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 19:19 |
| According to Robert a document can be in more than one state at a time in the sequence EDIT&#62;REVIEW&#62;TEST&#62;RELEASE? I don&#39;t understand that. %RED%Yes, it can but that is under the control of the Owner.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:04 |
| If testing can be done while the document is in review, which I don&#39;t recommend, what happens if the review results in a change to the document? Is testing redone? If not, how does one know that no error has been introduced? %RED%I would agree with you in most cases, but I would say it was ok if the Reviewer is cleaning up wording and not changing the essence and order of the steps.  I trust people to make good decisions here.  (And most will not do it in parallel.%ENDCOLOR% | Main.TedHesselroth | 22 Mar 2010 - 20:43 |
