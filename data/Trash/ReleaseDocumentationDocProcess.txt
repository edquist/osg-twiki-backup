---++Introduction
This document describes the processes us by OSG to manage its documentation.
There are actually 3 interrelated processes that involve documentation:
   1. Ownership/Review Process
   1. New Release Process
   1. Ongoing Evaluation and Improvement Process

Each of these are straightforward and take into account the low resource, collaborative environment of OSG.
---++Ownership/Review Process
Each document in the OSG Documentation TWiki must have an owner who is responsible for creation and/or maintenance/update of that document.
The owner is named within the document using the TWiki <verbatim>%RESPONSIBLE%</verbatim> command.
The responsibilities of the owner are given in OwnerResponsibilities.

Each document must also have a reviewer who is responsible for reviewing the document for content, accuracy, usability, and format.

The list of documents and their owners and reviewers is automatically maintained by the DocStatus page.
