---++Introduction

This document describes the processes us by OSG to manage its documentation.
There are actually 3 interrelated processes that involve documentation:
   1. Ownership/Review Process
   1. Testing/New Release Process
   1. Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process

Each of these are straightforward and take into account the low resource, collaborative environment of OSG.
The first and third of these processes are owned by the Content Management Area Coordinator who is responsible for maintaining the process descriptions, 
changing the processes as needed, and managing the execution of the processes.
The second process is owned and managed by the OSG Integration Test Bed Coordinator.

---++Ownership/Review Process
Each document in the OSG Documentation TWiki must have an Owner who is responsible for creation and/or maintenance/update of that document.
The Owner is named within the document using the TWiki !%RESPONSIBLE% constant.
The responsibilities of the Owner are given in OwnerResponsibilities.

Each document must also have a Reviewer who is responsible for reviewing the document for content, accuracy, usability, and format.
The Reviewer is named within the document using the TWiki !%REVIEW% constant.
The responsibilities of the Reviewer are given in ReviewerResponsibilities.

The steps in the Ownership/Review Process apply to all documents in the OSG Documentation TWiki.
They are:
   1. For any new or existing document (that is not being eliminated), an Owner and Reviewer volunteers or is assigned by the Content Management Area Coordinator in conjunction with the Owner, and the Owner's local management.
   1. A brief (30 minute) on-line training package will be used to train the Owner and Reviewer in the relevant documentation process, standards, and templates to be used by the Owner.
   1. The Owner produces or make the existing document conform to the standards/template and marks the document READYFORREVIEW.
   1. The Reviewer reviews the document and marks the document REVIEWED, then works in collaboration with the Owner to resolve issues with the document.
      a. If the document is a procedure or installation document, the Reviewer will mark the document READYFORTEST.
      a. The Tester will perform the test, document any problems, and mark the document TESTED.
      a. The Tester will collaborate with the Owner to resolve any issues discovered by the testing.  When resolved the Tester will mark the document TESTPASSED.
   1. When the Review and Owner are satisfied with the document, the Reviewer mark the document COMPLETE.

The list of documents and their owners and reviewers and document status is automatically maintained by the !!DocStatus page.

---++ Testing/New Release Process

This process applies to all documents in the [[ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][ReleaseDocumentation Web]].  When a new release of the OSG software is being integrated, documented, and tested, the Integration Test Bed Coordinator manages the process that is documented by xx.
That process uses the Owner, Reviewer, and Tester consistent with the Ownership/Review process above.

---++ Ongoing Evaluation/Improvement Process

This process covers the ongoing evaluation and improvement of OSG documentation.  It makes use of user feedback in the form of comments and a document rating mechanism to identify documents or document areas in need of improvement.  In addition the Document Architect ([[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=889][OSG DocDB #889]]) and Content Management Area Coordinator may review mailing lists comments and other information to identify areas needing improvement.

On a quarterly basis, a set of documents will be identified for improvement.  The Owner and Reviewer for each of these will be asked to make improvements that will be tracked by the Document Architect.  At the same time particularly well rated documents will be identified to use as examples of high-quality documents.  Once a year, the best of our documents will be identified and their Owners and Reviewers will be recognized.
