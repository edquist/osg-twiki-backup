---++Introduction
=OSG-client= is the package provided by OSG for user interaction with the Grid: it allows to initiate the proxies and provides the clients to use Compute Elements and Storage Elements.
It can be installed as root for all the users in the system or by regular users for personal consumption.
This page covers the second case, the personal installation.
OSG supports multiple Unix shells. The examples in this page use =sh= (=bash=). For =csh= or other shells see the referenced documentation.

Other hands-on guides are available at HandsOn.

---++Requirements
=OSG-client= requires for you to have one of the many VDT supported platforms (see the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html][VDT requirements]]), network connection and about 1.2 GB of disk space available. To use the Grid you will need also your [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertificateGet][Grid Certificate]].

---++Getting Pacman
%LINK_GLOSSARY_PACMAN% is a package management used by OSG.
OSG 1.2 requires Pacman 3.28 or later. If you have an earlier version or no Pacman, you need to [[PacmanInstall][install Pacman]]:
<pre class="screen">
wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.28.tar.gz
tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.28.tar.gz
cd pacman-3.28
source setup.sh
</pre>

---++Installing OSG-client

It is recommended to install OSG-client in a local file system (on shared ones the installation may fail due to load). In the example I will use =/scratch/=, a local directory with write access to regular users

<pre class="screen">
source /scratch/pacman-3.28/setup.sh 
mkdir /scratch/osg-client
cd /scratch/osg-client
pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client
</pre>
Answer =yall= when asked to trust the caches (you will trust al the caches used in the installation).

The installation should complete with something like:
<pre class="screen">
Beginning VDT prerequisite checking script vdt-common/vdt-prereq-check...       

All prerequisite checks are satisfied.

========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.

The VDT version 2.0.0 has been installed.
                                         
The OSG Client package OSG version 1.2 has been installed.

More information about installing and using OSG-client is available in the ClientInstallationGuide

More information on available commands and how to use the OSG Client can be found in the [[http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/ITB/UserTutorial][User tutorial]] and the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ValidateClients][CE and Client validation section]] both referenced below.

---++Client use
Here is a brief presentation placing the OSG client within the Grid stack and introducing the [[http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/ITB/UserTutorial][end user tutorial]] that was presented during the March 09 OSG All Hands meeting.
In the [[http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/ITB/UserTutorial][tutorial]] you will find useful information and examples of basic commands that you can run once you install the OSG client.
