---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators who are planning to enable Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe installed with installation of !BeStMan service  or stand-alone !GridFTP  service. Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe generates accounting  information about file transfers and reports it to  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector][the central Gratia collector]].

This document applies to the latest release %RED% OSG-%OSG_VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%. All procedures presented in this document in general require _root_ privileges.

---++ Introduction

The !BeStMan server is using !GridFTP server to transfer files to/from  any Posix compliant file system. Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe monitor these transfer  by parsing the Globus !GridFTP server logs and reports it to Gratia Collector.
This document describes the Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe configuration procedure. This procedure must be repeated once for every stand-adlone !GridFTP server that is installed for the !BeStMan service.

---++ Configuring Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe

Gratia !GridFTP  transfer probe is installed simultaneously with [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan]] or [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GsiFtpStandAlone][standalone GridFTP server]]. It is not enabled by default. In order to see what is installed from %CACHE% execute the following commands (%ICON{warning}% ==VDT_LOCATION== is the name of the directory where you have previously installed !BeStMan):

<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
vdt-control --list
[root@fg0x1 itb_bestman]# vdt-control --list
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs   | cron   | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | enable
gratia-gridftp-tran| cron   | do not enable
bestman            | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron     | cron   | do not enable
</pre>  

To configure Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe do the following:
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia  \
 --probe gridftp-transfer \
 --report-to &lt;gratia_host:gratia_port&gt; \
 --probe-cron --site-name &lt;SiteName&gt;
</pre>
To view more options, do following
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia  \
 --help
</pre>
Where ==gratia_host== is FQDN of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/AccountingServices][Gratia collector]], ==gratia_port== is Gratia Collector port and  ==site-name== is your site name.
For ITB collector use the following values:<br/>
==gratia_host== gratia-osg-itb.opensciencegrid.org<br/>
==gratia_port== 8881<br/>

For OSG collector use the following values:<br/>
==gratia_host==  gratia-osg-transfer.opensciencegrid.org<br/>
==gratia_port==  80<br/>

If you want to do additional changes in configuration, eg change location of gridftp logs or name of the Grid (default is OSG) you can edit ==ProbConfig== file  located in
==$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer== directory.

%ICON{warning}% Due to a bug in the latest release you will need to modify ==ProbeConfig== file  located in
==$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer== directory and add the location of !GridFTP logs<pre class="file">
    GridftpLogDir="&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/globus/var/log"
</pre>

---++  Creating osg-user-vo-map.txt

Please read  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/OsgSupportedVos][this page]] about files that are required to accurately collect grid resource usage and metrics by VO for transfer submitted using grid proxies or where voms proxy information is not available. 

---+++ Using GUMS based authorization mode

In order to enable generation of osg-user-vo-map.txt from GUMS  do the following:
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
vdt-control --enable gums-host-cron
vdt-control --on gums-host-cron
$VDT_LOCATION/gums/scripts/gums-host-cron
</pre>

---+++ Using Gridmap based authorization mode

Note: If you are using this mode for authorization, make sure the files /etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf and /etc/grid-security/prima-authz.conf do not exist.

In order to enable generation of grid-mapfile and  osg-user-vo-map.txt by using the edg-mkgridmap cron process to get information form VOMS servers do the following:
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
vdt-control --enable edg-mkgridmap
vdt-control --on edg-mkgridmap
$VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap 
</pre>

---++ Enable Gratia !GridFTP Transfer probe

You will now need to enable Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe:
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
vdt-control --enable gratia-gridftp-transfer
</pre>

----++ Starting/Stopping Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe

  1. Gratia  !GridFTP  probe installed on !BeStMan or !GridFTP nodes could be started together with all other services by issuing ==vdt-control --on== command. If you want to start it separately do the following:<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
vdt-control --on gratia-gridftp-transfer
</pre>
  1. Gratia  !GridFTP probe installed on !BeStMan or !GridFTP nodes could be stopped together with all other services by issuing ==vdt-control --off== command. If you want to stop it separately do the following:<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
vdt-control --off gratia-gridftp-transfer
</pre>
The detailed description of all the options available to start/stop services could be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices][here]].

----++ Log files and configuration location

You could find log and configuration files related to probe at the following  location on a relevant node: 

| *Module Name* |  *Configuration files* | *Log files* | 
|Gratia !GridFTP probe|$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig|$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/logs|
|Gridmap file||/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile|
|OSG User VO Map file||$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt|

---++ Sanity Check

If you turned on !GridFTP Gratia transfer probes you should be able to see the accounting information by accessing your Gratia collector. Keep in mind that probe collection is executed by a cron job, so check the time
the cron job will be executed:
<pre class="rootscreen">
crontab -l
5,15,25,35,45,55 * * * * &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/gridftp-transfer_meter.cron.sh > &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;/gratia/var/logs/gratia-probe-gridftp-transfer.log 2>&1
</pre>

To access the information, go to http://&lt;gratia_host&gt;:&lt;gratia_port&gt;/gratia-reporting/, click on "Custom SQL Query" on the left site menu frame, enter the following query into provided text box:
<pre class="screen">
select * from MasterTransferSummary where ProbeName like 'gridftp-transfer:&lt;your_host_name&gt;';
</pre>
click on "Execute Query" and you will see the total number of transfer per user. To get more detailed information you can execute the following query:
<pre class="screen">
select j.dbid, j.ResourceType ,j.LocalJobId,LocalUserId,j.CommonName,j.KeyInfoContent,j.Status,j.StartTime,
         j.EndTime,j.SubmitHost,m.ReportedSiteName,m.Grid, n.Value,n.StorageUnit 
         from JobUsageRecord j, JobUsageRecord_Meta m, Network n  
         where j.dbid=m.dbid and j.dbid=n.dbid and m.ProbeName like 'gridftp-transfer:&lt;your_host_name&gt;'  order by dbid;
</pre>
