---++ This page is obsolete

This Web page is obsolete. It is here just to host a few bits of information that have not been verified to exist elsewhere.

Please refer to for [[LocalAuthPreConfig][the Local Authorization information]] from now on.

---++ Old Stuff

---+++!! Test the edg-mkgridmap service and configuration.
As <i>root</i>, run:
<pre class="screen">
source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.(c)sh
cd $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin
./edg-mkgridmap  --output=test.out
</pre>
*Note:* If this generates no output, assume complete success.

The =test.out= file contains all the gridmap entries for the supported VOs and any local gridmap entries, if specified. If you see any messages when you run the command, the members of those VOs will not appear in the =test.out= file. If you look at the files created from the above test, you will notice that the script makes a backup of your current file with a '.1' suffix.  Since this was the initial running of the script, the =test.out.1= is empty.

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>ls -l test.out* </b>
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root 611236 Oct 30 13:49 test.out
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root      0 Oct 30 15:03 test.out.1
</pre>

If the VO administrator has not enabled world read of the VO membership, then you must contact the VO administrator and request that your site be given access to the VOMS database. You will need to provide the Subject and Issuer Distinguished Names (DN) for your host certificate.  The simplest thing to do is send email to the VO administrator requesting access and including the output of the following command (check that the path to the =hostcert.pem= is correct). 
<pre class="screen">
 > <b>openssl x509 -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem -subject -noout </b>
</pre> 
 If you recall, the VO administrator is identified in the =# USER-VO-MAP= entry of the =edg-mkgridmap.conf= file.  If you find that this is no longer the current contact for the VO, you should contact the Grid Operations Center (goc@opensciencegrid.org) for help.

---+++!! Create your grid-map file
If you are satisfied with your =edg=mkgridmap.conf= file configuration, you can create your =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= by running the script manually as =root= user:
<pre class="screen">
(YOUR_VDT_LOCATION)/edg/sbin/edg-mkgridmap
</pre>  

---+++!! Retest the authorization mode using site verify
Run the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall#Site_Verification][Site Verification]]
 script again locally (as a regular user, not as root) and verify that the authorization still works. 

---+++!! Activate the edg-mkgridmap cron service
If you have not already done so and are satisfied with your =edg-mkgridmap= configuration, you can enable and activate the service (previously described):
<pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
vdt-register-service --name edg-mkgridmap --enable
vdt-control --on edg-mkgridmap
</pre>

*Note:* Remember that if you wish to change the times on the service:
   * you need to turn the service off, 
   * edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/state file entry
   * turn the service back on.
