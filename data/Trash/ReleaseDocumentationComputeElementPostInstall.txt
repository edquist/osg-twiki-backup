S. Timm--the part about choosing a CA distribution is no longer needed, it is
covered under managing the CA certificates.. All this stuff now commented out.

As of version 1.0, the OSG software no longer automatically downloads CAs.

To pull the OSG recommended CA distribution edit the cacerts_url in the configuration file at
<verbatim>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-update-certs.conf</verbatim>

This file contains URLs to CA Certificate distributions including the OSG GOC distribution with certificates recommended by the OSG Security Team, as well as the VDT convenience distribution. You must uncomment one of these (or create your own), and then run the commands below to activate the certificate updates.

<verbatim># source $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-questions.sh; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-setup-ca-certificates

# vdt-control --enable vdt-update-certs
# vdt-control --on vdt-update-certs</verbatim>

To read a summary of the security team's CA distribution process see https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CADistribution.
