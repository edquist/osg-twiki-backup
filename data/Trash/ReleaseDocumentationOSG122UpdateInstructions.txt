---++ Release Notes

Release notes can be found [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p8.html][here]].

---++ Update Instructions
If you have OSG 1.2 installed you can update following the instructions below.

If you have an earlier version of OSG you must do a new installation because OSG 1.0.x and OSG 1.2.x use two different Pacman caches.

There are installation guides for installing the various components available at the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][release documentation web]]. In addition, for experienced admins, there is a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/QuickInstallGuide][streamlined installation guide]] available as well.

---++ Update Instructions from OSG 1.2.0/1.2.1 to OSG 1.2.2

*Stop VDT Services*
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION
# source setup.sh
# vdt-control --off
</pre>

*Backup your installation*
<pre class="screen">
# cp -ar $VDT_LOCATION [BACKUP_LOCATION]
</pre>

*Update the VDT updater script*

 If you do not yet have the updater script, then fetch it:

<pre class="screen">
# pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:VDT-Updater
</pre>

If you already have the updater, update it:
<pre class="screen">
# pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre>

Note: If you are not sure if you have the updater, look for VDT_LOCATION/vdt/update/vdt-updater 

*Backup*
You'll need to backup again since the vdt-updater script will request the location of your backup and verify that the backup is identical to the current contents of the CE install directory before updating your installation.
<pre class="screen">
# cp -pr $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP-LOCATION
</pre>  or 
<pre class="screen">
# rsync -a $VDT_LOCATION/ BACKUP-LOCATION
</pre>

*Get VDT Updates*
<pre class="screen">
# vdt/update/vdt-updater
</pre>

*Get OSG Updates*
You'll need to backup your config.ini before updating your osg packages
<pre class="screen">
# pacman -update osg-version</verbatim>
# cp $OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini /tmp/config.ini.backup
# pacman -update osg-config</verbatim>
# cp /tmp/config.ini.backup $OSG_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini 
</pre>


*Post Install Configuration*
Admins using SGE will need to change the SGE section in config.ini.  You will need to remove the =sge_location= and =sge_home= options and add the =sge_root= and =sge_cell= options from the =SGE= section.  These two options correspond to the =SGE_ROOT= and =SGE_CELL= environment variables set by SGE.  In addition, they should be set so that =$SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/settings.sh= is a valid file.

<pre class="screen">
# vdt-post-install
# configure-osg -c
</pre>


*Restart VDT Services*
<pre class="screen">
# vdt-control --on
</pre>
