%TOC%

---++Introduction

The !GridFTP-Xrootd  (generic !GridFtp with !Xrootd pre-load libraries) package contains components necessary to set up a !GridFTP server as an additional server for !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd installation or just on top of !Xrootd  servicem as well as all the  tools necessary file transfer accounting.
A stand-alone   !GridFTP-Xrootd  server might be useful in the following goals:
   * To provide a  simple front-end to a !Xrootd service allowing access over WAN 
   * To achieve a better load balancing by providing multiple !GridFTP server under !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd i


---++++++!!Applicable Versions
This document applies to an install of 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.4* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).


---++++++!!Engineering Considerations
!GridFTP-Xrootd server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp][GridFTP documentation]]. It is recommended that multiple !GridFTP-Xrootd instances on different servers if:
   * You are using !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd that is serving the VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and have more than 250 cores
   * Your storage will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space
   * If you are planning to have a Storage Element with !BeStMan- gateway/Xrootd and have more than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one !GridFTP-Xrootd server per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the
server) if you want to maximize throughput. 

Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe is an optional package that is implemented as a cron job that reports all the file transfers to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector Gratia collector]]

[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS][GUMS server]] - authorization service

---++Checklist
   1. [[PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is required
   1. The server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security/=
   1. The firewall must allow incoming connections to the gsiftp port (default 2811). Outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.
   1. A working GUMS server or a gridmap-file are needed for authorization using grid certificates.


---++Installation Procedure
Login as root and set up  pacman, make sure that >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is installed:

<pre class="screen">
su root
. &lt;PACMAN_LOCATION&gt;/setup.sh
pacman -version
</pre>

Next create and change to an installation directory. This directory will later be used to get the !GridFTP-Xrootd package  from the %CACHE% cache.
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/%OSG_VERSION%-gridftp-xrootd/
cd /opt/osg%OSG_VERSION%-gridftp-xrootd/
</pre>

You will need to install !GridFTP-Xrootd package from the %CACHE% cache. 
Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=) and whether you want to accept the license (=y=).
 
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Xrootd-GridFTP
</pre>

The install procedure will print out a warning:
<verbatim>
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</verbatim>

Before proceed with CA certificates installation you may want to install to install Gratia transfer probes:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:Gratia-GridFTP
. setup.sh
</pre>


Now you may proceed to CA certificates setup. Keep in  mind the information provided in the README is out of date. Please setup the CA certificates in the following way instead:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local -url osg
</pre>
This command will download certificates distributed by the OSG to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= and create a symlink from =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to that location. [[VDTCAManage][Other options]] are also available.

To reflect the changes update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>


You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. To see all services available use =vdt-control -list=
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
vdt-control --list
</pre>

This completes the installation of the !GridFTP-Xrootd server. Move to the next step to configure  !GridFTP-Xrootd server and Gratia transfer probe at this time.

---++ Service Configuration
The  !GridFTP-Xrootd server and Gratia transfer probe are configured by the =configure-osg= script located in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/configure-osg= based on the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= configuration file.

The =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/= directory contains two template files =config.ini=. You will have to  edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file following instructions that precede each entry.  Here is the list of entries that need to be changed:

<pre class="screen">

[Gridftp]
enabled = %(enable)s
mode = xrootd
redirector = &lt;xrootd_redirector_fqn&gt;
mount_point = &lt;virtual mount point&gt;
redirector_storage_path = &lt;storage area on redirector node&gt; 


[Gratia]
enabled = %(enable)s
sitename = &lt;your registered site name&gt;
probes = %(itb-gridftp-gratia)s
</pre>

The =Misc Services= section defines what method of authorization should be used. If your site uses a %RED%gridmap-file%ENDCOLOR% for authorization, please make following changes:
<pre class="screen">
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
authorization_method = gridmap
</pre>

In case your site supports %RED%GUMS%ENDCOLOR%, the fully qualified domain name of the GUMS server must be specified:

<pre class="screen">
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
gums_host = &lt;your gums server fqn&gt;
authorization_method = prima
</pre>

You can verify that your configuration is valid by executing =configure-osg -v=. Finally execute =configure-osg -c= to configure the !BeStMan installation.
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>

Hopefully all steps completed successfully and =vdt-control -list= shows the list of available services:
<pre class="screen">
#vdt-control --list
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl               | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs         | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs        | cron   | enable
gsiftp                  | inetd  | enable
gratia-gridftp-transfer | cron   | enable
gums-host-cron          | cron   | enable
edg-mkgridmap           | cron   | do not enable
</pre>

To configure the port range used by the server to transfer files, add following lines to =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh=:

<pre class="screen">
  export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=32000,64000
  export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=32000,64000
</pre>



 If you want to use the grid-map-file for user authentication and authorization ignore the rest of this section. Copy two files from $VDT_LOCATION/post-install to in /etc/grid-security:
<pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>

---++ Start/Stop !GridFtp-Xrootd

You will need to login to node where  GridFtp-Xrootd is installed  to start/stop xrtood:

To start:

<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/osg-v1.2
. setup.sh
vdt-control -on
</pre>

To stop:

<pre class="screen">
cd /opt/osg-v1.2
. setup.sh
vdt-control -on
</pre>


---++ Validation of Service Operation

Login on the node where you have installed have your certificate installed and access to http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:client.

You will need to get your voms-proxy certificate:

voms-proxy-init –voms <voname>:/<voname> 

Then test GridFtp:
<pre class="screen">
cd  /opt/osg-v1,2 
. setup.sh 
echo “This is a test” >/tmp/test 
globus-url-copy -dbg file:///tmp/test gsiftp://<GridFtp_host>/local/xrootd/data/test
</pre>

Verify that the [[ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaTransferProbe#Sanity_Check][gratia probe is working]].
