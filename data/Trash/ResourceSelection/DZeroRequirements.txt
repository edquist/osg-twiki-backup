---+Requirements

The following document lists a set of functional and performance requirements for an OSG Resource Selection Service (RSS). The requirements stem from the needs of the DZero experiment using the SAM-Grid system for job management. These requirements are the target of the implementation of the OSG RSS. The RSS will support VO with similar requirements.


---+++Usability

1.   A command line interface to interact with the principal functions of the RSS will be available

2.   A job will have mechanisms to express requirements on resources in the job description

3.   The RSS will provide extensible resource ranking mechanisms, for those resources that satisfy the job requirements

4.   The RSS will substitute resource attributes references in the job description with corresponding values for the selected resource.

---+++Performance

1.   The RSS will support a community of 100 users, submitting jobs to 10 job schedulers.

2.   RSS should support 10,000 jobs per day, with bursts of 2,000 per hour.

3.   RSS should support 100 clusters

4.   RSS should support a job and resource descriptions (e.g. in classad format) with 200 attributes and 5 Kbytes of information.

5.   The RSS will not provide facilities to implement job / data co-location. The DZero VO will achieve this result using SAM. The RSS will provide an extensible framework for resource ranking algorithms: VOs will be responsible for studying the feasibility of this approach, according to their requirements.

---++Non-Requirements

1.   The RSS does not provide job scheduling. The resource selection recommendations can be made available via internal interfaces to standard scheduling systems, such as Condor-G.
