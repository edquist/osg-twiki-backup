---++ How to download and build osg-ce-plugin from ETICS



---+++ Introduction

The [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php?n=Main.AboutCEMon][CEMon]] service   is a part of [[http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite][gLite middleware]]. 
It is responsible for publishing information coming from the Computing Element (CE) in a certain format depending on a type of sensors that are plugged into CEMon. The information could be pulled (e.g. a client queries the CEMon service) or pushed (a client subscribes to get events from the CEMon service). 
The plug-in that is used in OSG CE installation is called glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin.  Initial implementation has been done by CEMon developers. For the  time being all new development and support are done at Fermilab (CD/SF/GRID/OSG).

*glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin* supports two dialects ( RAW and OLD_CLASSAD).  Event in RAW format corresponds to exact output of a GIP script running on CE node. Event in OLD_CLASSAD is formatted according [[https://forge.cnaf.infn.it/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/v_1_3/spec/draft-3/pdf/GLUESchema.pdf?rev=33&root=glueschema][Glue Schema 1.3]].
