---++ How to download and build osg-ce-plugin from ETICS



---+++ Introduction

The [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php?n=Main.AboutCEMon][CEMon]] service   is a part of [[http://glite.web.cern.ch/glite][gLite middleware]]. 
It is responsible for publishing information coming from the Computing Element (CE) in a certain format depending on a type of sensors that are plugged into CEMon. The information could be pulled (e.g. a client queries the CEMon service) or pushed (a client subscribes to get events from the CEMon service). 
The plug-in that is used in OSG CE installation is called glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin.  Initial implementation has been done by CEMon developers. For the  time being all new development and support are done at Fermilab (CD/SF/GRID/OSG).

*glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin* supports two dialects ( RAW and OLD_CLASSAD).  Event in RAW format corresponds to exact output of a GIP script running on CE node. Event in OLD_CLASSAD is formatted according [[https://forge.cnaf.infn.it/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/*checkout*/v_1_3/spec/draft-3/pdf/GLUESchema.pdf?rev=33&root=glueschema][Glue Schema 1.3]].
 
---+++ Downloading glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin from ETCIS

*glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin*  source code could be download from [[http://etics.web.cern.ch/etics/][ETICS]] build system used by EGEE.  First follow instruction s provided in [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/EGEE/DevelopersGuide#Etics_build_system_overview][Developers Guide]].

Then do the following:

<verbatim>
etics-workspace-setup
etics-get-project org.glite
etics-checkout --config  glite-ce_R_1_X_X_X  \
  --project-config glite_branch_3_1_0 org.glite.ce
</verbatim>

---+++ Downloading glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin

Do modification ( source code is under org.glite.ce.osg-ce-plugin/src/org/glite/ce/osgceplugin/ directory)
<verbatim>
etics-build org.glite.ce.osg-ce-plugin
</verbatim>

---+++ Submitting and tagging code changes
For the time being checking new code into ETICS, tagging it and releasing a new rpm is done by CEMon developers and maintainers.


---+++ Installing CEMon
There are two ways to install CEMon. One is to have [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php?n=Main.CEMonForGlite3-1SLC4InstallationAndConfigurationNotesV1-1][&#8220;glite&#8221; installation]] where you have to install and configure tomcat, glite trustmanager and all related cemon rpms. The other way to installed it is to follow  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CEMonOnComputeElement][&#8220;OSG CE&#8221; installation]].
