---+ System Deployment and Integration

---+++ Quick links
ServiceReadiness for the OSG Integration Test Bed

---+++ General considerations
As of April 2006, the system is ready for deployment<br>
Our target is deploying the CEMon infrastructure to the sites on OSG v0.6.0<br>
<p>
We are collaborating with 
   * the VDT team to package CEMon and provide automatic configuration scripts
   * the ITB team to set up a pre-production system test bed
   * the TG-MIG to reuse components of the monitoring infrastructure e.g. the Generic Information Providers (GIP)
   * the OSG Executive Team to facilitate communication with the OSG community 
   * the Fermilab Administrators to set up the central !ReSS services (Information Gatherer and Match Making Service)
<p>
If the integration tests do not expose any major problems AND the OSG v0.6.0 release proceeds accroding to the original plans, the !ReSS infrastructure should become available in July 2006.

---+++ How to connect your Condor-G installation with ReSS

Typically, Condor-G is configured to run only the scheduling server (condor_schedd). In order for the scheduler to contact the resource selection service, one needs to change 3 parameters in the condor_schedd configuration.

After setting up the condor environment, the configuration file is generally available from the environment variable $CONDOR_CONFIG. Edit this file and add the fully qualified domain name of the central resource selection machine to the following parameters: 

<pre>
COLLECTOR_HOST  = central.resource.selection.machine
HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR = central.resource.selection.machine
HOSTALLOW_NEGOTIATOR_SCHEDD = original_value, central.resource.selection.machine
</pre>

As of July 2006, the fully qualified domain name of the central resource selection machine is <b>osg-ress-1.fnal.gov</b>

Restart or issue a condor_reconfig command, in order for the changes to take place.

Jobs submitted to this condor_schedd should contact the resource selection service if their job description file (JDF) specifies

<pre>
universe = globus
globusscheduler = $$(GlueCEInfoContactString) 
</pre>

In order for the job to select a set of requirements on the cluster, one can write an expression for the "requirements" attribute of the JDF. 

<pre>
requirements = requirement_expression
</pre>

The syntax of the resource attributes is the same as the the LDIF representation of the GLUE Schema. An example of a valid requirement is

<pre>
requirements = TARGET.GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP == TRUE
</pre>

To select resources based on the presence of a value from a list attribute (comma separated strings of values), one can use the function match_string. For example

<pre>
requirements = match_string("DZero-Application_v1_2";TARGET.GlueHostApplicationSoftwareRunTimeEnvironment) == TRUE 
</pre>

For more information see this [[TestBedPrototype][report]].


The following is a real resource ClassAd (created on Aug 15, 2006). Any attribute can be in principle used for Resource Selection.
