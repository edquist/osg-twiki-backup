<h1>System Deployment</h1>

As of April 2006, the system is ready for deployment<br>
Our target is deploying the CEMon infrastructure to the sites on OSG v0.6.0<br>
<p>
We are collaborating with 
* the VDT team to package CEMon and provide automatic configuration scripts
* the ITB team to set up a pre-production system test bed
* the TG-MIG to reuse components of the monitoring infrastructure e.g. the Generic Information Providers (GIP)
* the OSG Executive Team to facilitate communication with the OSG community 
* the Fermilab Administrators to set up the central ReSS services (Information Gatherer and Match Making Service)
<p>
If the integration tests do not expose any major problems AND the OSG v0.6.0 release proceeds accroding to the original plans, the ReSS infrastructure should become available in July 2006.
