---+++OSG Resource Selection and SAM-Grid interoperability
<H3>Date: Sep 1, 2005<br>
Authors: Gabriele Garzoglio, Amber Boehnlein, Adam Lyon,

<p>
The Open Science Grid is building a US national grid infrastructure for multiple scientific communities. Dozens of computing centers and universities provide access to computing, storage, and network resources via standard grid interfaces and protocols. Users currently submit jobs directly to these resources, selecting them before job submission and specifying all relevant resource attributes in the job description. The necessity of a human intervention in resource selection and attribute specification hinders external automated job management components from accessing OSG resources. Several Virtual Organizations would benefit from a Resource Selection Service (RSS) that could automatically select OSG resources based on the job requirements. Providing such Resource Selection Service is one of the goals of this project.

<p>
The SAM-Grid implements one such job management component for the DZero and CDF experiments VO. The component has two responsibilities: (1) application management, including job environment preparation, and (2) resource management. Currently, the SAM-Grid can only access resources where some of its components have been deployed. Among other things, these components report to the SAM-Grid the necessary information to perform resource selection. The SAM-Grid will be able to delegate such task to the new OSG RSS, thus eliminating the need for deploying SAM-Grid directly on all OSG resources.

<p>
The OSG RSS will satisfy the requirements of the SAM-Grid system and it will be offered as a general service for those VO that have similar requirements. The project aims at delivering the functionalities needed by the SAM-Grid for resource selection early 2006. These functionalities include basic resource ranking algorithms (such as random selection). The RSS will provide an extensible framework to introduce new ranking algorithms, should VO be interested in them.

<p>
Another goal for this project is to reduce as much as possible the dependence of the SAM-Grid on the implementation of the RSS. The SAM-Grid will be able to integrate different resource selection systems that meet the SAM-Grid requirements. 

<p>
In summary, the project has two main goals:

<p>
1) deploy a system that makes the OSG resources accessible by the SAM-Grid. The system will have architecture similar to the SAM-Grid / LCG integrated system. The architecture will have provisions to allow different RSS implementations.
<p>
2) providing OSG with a general resource selection service. Such service has two main responsibilities: (a) allow users to reference resource attributes from the job description, in order to express job requirements and automate the substitution of the resource attribute values in the job description; (b) select the optimal resource, if more than one resources satisfy the job requirements, using an extensible framework to define selection criteria. The project will focus on (a) and provide basic implementations of the resource selection algorithm (such as "random") for (b).

<p>
The program of work and efforts for this project is sponsored by the PPDG Common Project and the Fermilab Computing Division. The project progress will be tracked and discussed through the PPDG Common Project meetings.

<p>
The project will deliver:<br>
- a resource selection system integrated with the OSG information system and resources.<br>
- an infrastructure capable of forwarding jobs prepared by the SAM-Grid to the OSG resources<br>

<p>
The project will not deliver:<br>
- job scheduling<br>
- maintenance for the services<br>
- "intelligent" resource selection mechanisms<br>
