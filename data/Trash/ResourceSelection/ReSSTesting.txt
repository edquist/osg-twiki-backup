---+!!Testing Resource Selection Service

This document describes tests done on ReSS.

---++Testing Environment
Resource Broker Machine: osg-ress-1.fnal.gov<br>
Condor Host: osg-ress-1.fnal.gov

---+++Test Case: Stress test the match-making infrastructure submitting O(1) jobs/sec for 1 hour

---++++ Test Description
This test evaluates the efficiency of the condor_negotiator, to match elements of an attribute list. We estimated a load of around 400 resource classads to simulate this test environment.

It is a common requirement from the users that, their jobs be matched to a site that contains a particular string in one of the resource attributes. We identified Condor's native function, stringlistimember() as an appropriate function to achieve the desired results for match making.

We configured the testbed with 
<ol>
<li>16 CEMons (4 nodes running 4 CEMons each) </li>
<li>4 CEMons (4 Nodes running 1 CEMon each)</li>
<li>In addition to the classads sent through IG, we pumped in dummy classads using condor_advertise to simulate 426 resources.</li>
</ol>

---++++ Results
<ul>
<li>Jobs Submitted = 1 job/sec for hour.</li>
<li>Total Jobs Submitted = 3600</li>
<li>First Job Matched = 9/8/2006 16:33:00</li>
<li>Last Job Matched = 9/9/2006 02:05:53</li>
<li>Resources Satisfying Jobs = 2 (1800 jobs per resource)</li>
<li>Total Number Of Resources = 426</li>
<li>Max Jobs Matched Per Negotiation Cycle Per Resource = 10</li>
<li>Total Jobs Matched In One Negotiation Cycle = 20</li>
<li>Longest Negotiation Cycle: 2 sec</li>
<li>Shortest Negotiation Cycle: 0 sec</li>
<li>Average Negotiation Cycle: 0.772222222222 sec</li>
</ul>
