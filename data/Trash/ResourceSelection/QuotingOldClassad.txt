---+Rules for quoting old classads

<pre>
Keywords
  If it is a special keyword, don't quote it.
  Special keywords: undefined, true, t, false, f, error
  int, float, and the like are not keywords in the ClassAd language and
  have no special meaning

Variables
  If an attribute refers to another attribute, the atttribute name is
  a variable, and is not quoted. For instance, if you have:
  X = 3
  Y = X
  then if you evaluate Y, you get 3. In this case, no quote marks are
  used. Variables can be combined into expressions, like:
  Y = X + 3
  Y = X > 3

Numbers
  Numbers are not quoted, unless you don't want them to be interpreted as
  numbers. There are floating point numbers and integers. If the C
  function strtod() recognizes it as a floating point number, then it
  is, otherwise it isn't.

Strings
  The only other thing you can have is a string, and it must be quoted.
  X = "blah"
  Y = X
  Z = "foo"
  Old ClassAd strings are rather simplistic. A backslash (\) quotes
  something. The only things you can quote are:
  \\
  \"
  \n
  \r
