---+!! !ReSS Security Review

%TOC%

---++ Introduction
The security review for !ReSS should focus on the overall design/architecture and on the Information Gatherer (IG) service developed by the !ReSS group. !ReSS uses third party software/tools like [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php?n=Main.HomePage][Cemon]] and [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor][Condor]]. The security review of these third party tools is outside the scope of !ReSS security review process. However, the process may review how the Cemon and Condor are used and how they interface with the IG service.
