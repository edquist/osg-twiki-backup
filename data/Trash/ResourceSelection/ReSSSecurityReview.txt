---+!! !ReSS Security Review

%TOC%

---++ Introduction
The security review for !ReSS should focus on the overall design/architecture and on the Information Gatherer (IG) service developed by the !ReSS group. !ReSS uses third party software/tools like [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cemon/field.php?n=Main.HomePage][Cemon]] and [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor][Condor]]. The security review of these third party tools is outside the scope of !ReSS security review process. However, the process may review how the Cemon and Condor are used and how they interface with the IG service.

---++ Test Installation 
Test setup to play with for this activity is similar to that of production and runs in HA mode. Minor difference w.r.t to the production is that, it runs a newer version of IG that will be released and deployed on the production systems soon. ress1x3.fnal.gov and ress2x3.fnal.gov host the !ReSS services handled by a LVS server. The service host name is osg-ress-test.fnal.gov. The installation is setup as follows -
   * IG: Running on osg-ress-test.fnal.gov (actual VMs ress1[2]x3.fnal.gov). IG service port is 8443
   * Condor: Running on osg-ress-test.fnal.gov (actual VMs ress1[2]x3.fnal.gov). Condor collector service port is 9618
   * CE: fapl123.fnal.gov simulates multiple CEs. !CEMon on the fapl123.fnal.gov publishes information available from several production !CEs to IG on osg-ress-test.fnal.gov
To most part, you should try to break the services on osg-ress-test.fnal.gov rather than those on fapl123.fnal.gov
