---+ !ReSS Classad Validation Mechanism

---++ Introduction

In the Resource Selection Service (!ReSS) model, sites advertise their characteristics to a central !ReSS information collector in the form old old-format classads. These classads are formed at sites by the Computing Element Monitor (CEMon) service, gathering site information from Generic Information Providers (GIP) scripts. This information is expressed via attributes according to the Glue Schema. 

The Open Science Grid (OSG) has agreed on a minimal set of critical attributes that sites must correctly advertise, in order for the OSG to consider the information from the site "valid". Also,
becase the semantic of Glue Schema attributes is well defined, only certain ranges of values can be expected for some attributes.

Following these considerations, the !ReSS project, in collaboration with OSG, has developed a mechanism to validate site classads. This documentation explains how this is achieved and how the validation mechanism can be maintained.
