A explanation of the major differences between OSG 1.0 and OSG 1.2 and how that will affect installation, configuration, and maintenance.

---++ Software Caches
The biggest difference between the two installations is the software cache that is must be used to get the software.  OSG 1.0 uses the OSG symbol so installing the ce package would be done by running =pacman -get OSG:ce= .  OSG 1.2 now uses an url to the cache.  So to install the ce package from OSG 1.2, you would need to run =pacman -get http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2:ce=.  

The motivation for this change was to allow OSG 1.0 and OSG 1.2 installations to be fully supported and to allow sites using osg 1.0.x to update as new releases come out.  Because pacman records the cache it used, the OSG symbol needed to be kept in order to prevent OSG 1.0 installations from breaking if they tried to run an update.  Going forward, future OSG releases will probably use an url to specify the cache.
