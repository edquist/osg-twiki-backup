---++ Introduction

This isn't an installation mode OSG recommends, however, probably good for very small Tier-3 sites,  test sites and tutorials.
Please refer to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman][BeStMan full-mode Installation Guide]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan-gateway Installation Guide]] for more details.


---+++!!Engineering Considerations

It could be not a very wise idea to install !BeStMan on heavily used CE node but if you need to do that you should keep in mind that you will need to use non-standard ports for !BeStMan to avoid conflict with apache/tomcat servers as well as use !GridFTP server and authorization infrastructure that are already installed on CE node.   

The following questions should be answered before you can proceed with installation and  configuration:

   $ Q. _What flavor of !BeStMan do you want to use?_: You can use either fullmode or gateway. Please read [[http://sdm.lbl.gov/bestman/docs/bestman-guide.html][BeStMan documentation]] for details.

   $ Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_: You have to decide if you want to use grid-map-file or !GUMS server for users’ authentication and authorization. Most logically will be to select the same approach that is already being used on CE (e.g authorization mechanism used for gatekeeper)
 
   $ Q. _If you are using !BeStMan-gateway, do you need to support static space tokens?_ : !BeStMan-gateway supports predefined, static space tokens that should be included in configuration. It doesn't keep trace or enforce static space tokens.  If you want partition your storage space and have a “designated” space for some  VOs or users you can choose to use space tokens. You will have to decide the names and descriptions of the tokens as well as the size of the area.  

   $ Q. _Do you want to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_: Yes!  The Gratia gridftp-transfer probes provide much-desired statistics that OSG uses for accounting, much like the Gratia job accounting.  More details can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome  Gratia Home Page]]. The reported information will include the source and destination of transfer, certificate subject of transfer initiator, size and status of the transferred file. This probe captures transfer statistics, hence it needs to be installed on your !GridFTP server. Keep in mind that you will report all the transfers that are going through !GridFTP server and not only the one that are initiated via !BeStMan.

---+++ How to get Help?

If a problem occurs during installation or verification of the service, see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman#Debugging_Information][BeStMan-fullmode debugging Information]] or  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway#Debugging_Information][BeStMan-gateway debugging Information]] .

If you cannot resolve the problem, the best way to get help is by following  [[HelpProcedure][this page]]. 

---++ Requirements

   1. [[ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >= %PACMAN_VERSION% is required. You should already installed it before you have installed CE.
   1. The server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security/=
   1. !BeStMan server needs to have a valid service certificate. The certificate should be own by a user login that is running !BeStMan server.The right permission (600) should be set on those files. By default !BeStMan is using a service certificate =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= and certificate key =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=.

%ICON{warning}%  !BeStMan should be configured with host certificate in order to be able to handle requests from !LCG-Utils tools. This is mandatory for at least all !BeStMan servers that support ATLAS experiment. Normally the OSG !BeStMan implementation uses a service certificate, not a host certificate. This causes lcg-cp to fail because the certificate name (which looks like http/hostname instead of just hostname or host/hostname) doesn't match the hostname. There are two ways to solve this problem:
   * copy hostcert.pem, hostkey.pem into /etc/grid-security/http and rename these two files to httpcert.pem, httpkey.pem respectively. Change ownership of these files and directory.
   * create a directory  /etc/grid-security/bestmancert copy hostcert.pem, hostkey.pem into this directory and  these two files to bestmancert.pem, bestmankey.pem.respectively. Change ownership of these files and directory. You will need to use relevant options to specify certificate and certificate key while configuring !BeStMan.

   1. The firewall issues for !Grid FTP and a working GUMS server or a gridmap-file should be already in place fater CE installation.

---++ !BeStMan Installation Procedure
<!-- conventions used in this document
   * Local INST_DIR = /opt/osg-%VERSION%
   * Local BESTMAN_HOST = bestman
   * Local BESTMAN_PROMPT_ROOT=[root@%BESTMAN_HOST% %INST_DIR%-bestman ]
   * Local UCL_PROMPT_ROOT=[root@%BESTMAN_HOST%]
-->
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway" section="Installation"}%
Now you will have to configure CA certificate in such a way so !BeStMan installation will use the same CA certificates you have already configured for your CE. Run the following command after you substitute ==$VDT_LOCATION_CE== with the actual directory of your CE installation:
<pre class="rootscreen">
vdt-ca-manage setupca --location $VDT_LOCATION_CE/globus/TRUSTED_CA --no-update
</pre>

This command will create a link from ==$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA== to  ==$VDT_LOCATION_CE/globus/TRUSTED_CA==. 
More information could be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CaCertificatesInstall][here]].
---++ !BeStMan Configuration

You will need to configure !BeStMan-Gateway first in order to enable it as a service. !BeStMan is recommended to run under non-root account.
Keep in mind that you have to use ports different from 8080 and 8443 and same authorization mechanism that is in use on that CE node.

---+++ !BeStMan-gateway

If you are installing !BeStMan-gateway mode follow these instructions:
%INCLUDE{"ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway" section="ComplexConfiguration"}%

---+++ !BeStMan-fullmode

If you are installing !BeStMan-fullmode follow these instructions.

---++ Configuring Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe

If you want to enable Gratia !GrdFTP transfer probe you will need to follow instructions provided in  [[GratiaTransferProbe#Configuring_Gratia_GridFTP_trans][Configuring Gratia transfer probe]]. 
After you have finished with configuration you will need to change the  location of gridftp logs. By default  the  location is pointing to !GridFTP logs for the !GridFTP server installed with !BeSTMan cache. If you are using CE !GridFTP server you have to edit _ProbConfig_ file  located in
_$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer_ directory.

You will need to modify the following parameters in probe configuration file ==$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer/ProbeConfig==.
   1. Location of _osg-vo-map.txt_ file <pre class="file">
   UserVOMapFile="&lt;CE_VDT_LOCATION&gt;/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt"
</pre>   
   1. Location of !GridFTP logs<pre class="file">
    GridftpLogDir="&lt;CE_VDT_LOCATION&gt;/globus/var/log"
</pre>

---++ Enabling the Services

You will need to enable  log rotation services. In order to so:
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
source setup.sh
vdt-control --enable  vdt-rotate-logs
</pre> 

---++ Services Startup/Shutdown 

The detailed description of all the options available to start/stop services could be found [[ReleaseDocumentation/StartingServices][here]].
You will need to start/stop the following services:
   * !BeStMan
   * gratia-gridftp-transfer
   * vdt-rotate-logs
<pre class="rootscreen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
source setup.sh
vdt-control --on bestman   vdt-rotate-logs gratia-gridftp-transfer
</pre> 


---+++ Integration with the information system

Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. See the topic [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Providers]]. The SE does not collect or publish information independently.

---++ Validation of Service Operation 

Please see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman#Validation_of_Service_Operation][BeStMan-fullmode]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway#Validation_of_Service_Operation][BeStMan-gateway]] for service validation and troubleshooting information.
