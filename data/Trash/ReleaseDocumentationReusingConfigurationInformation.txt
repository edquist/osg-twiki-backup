---++ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for System Administrators. It details the how to preserve configuration when doing a major update (e.g. OSG 1.2.x to 1.3.y).
If you're doing a minor update, such as OSG 1.2.18 to 1.2.19 then follow the [[OSG12UpdateInstructions][update instructions]].  In most cases configuration will be automatically preserved.  Installations that use configure-osg - currently CEs and RSV - will also apply configuration that is stored in the config.ini file.  You should not refer to the rest of this document if you are doing a minor update. 

If you are doing a major update, such as from OSG 1.0 to OSG 1.2 you can automatically reuse some of the configuration information from the old version in your new installation.  See below for details.

---++ How to reuse configuration information

A few notes:
   * the old installation must be on the same computer as the new installation you will be doing
   * you will do the new installation in a different location than the old location (unlike RPM which only has a single installation at a time)
   * the old installation will not be erased as part of the new installation

The basic process for the installation is the same as it is [[WebHome][documented elsewhere]] with one extra step at the beginning.  To reuse the configuration define the =$OLD_VDT_LOCATION= environment variable to point at your old installation *before running any Pacman commands*.  You must use a full path, for example:

<pre class="screen">
# For bash
export OLD_VDT_LOCATION=/opt/osg-1.0
# For csh
setenv OLD_VDT_LOCATION /opt/osg-1.0
</pre>

Then run any requisite Pacman commands to do your installation.  Old configuration will be automatically copied for some components.  To see the list of components that preserve installation and to get more information see [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_advanced.html#preserve_config][this VDT web page]].

---++ Reusing information for configure-osg
%NOTE% this information is only applicable to OSG 1.2.x installations

=configure-osg= gets it's configuration information from a file called =config.ini=.  This file can be found in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/=.  In order to transfer your configuration information from a previous installation, the =config.ini= from the older install should be copied to =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/= in the new install and =configure-osg -c= run so that the new install can be configured using the information from the old system.
