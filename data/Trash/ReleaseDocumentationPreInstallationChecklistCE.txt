---+!! Pre-Installation Checklist for Compute Element
%TOC%

---+ About this Document

%ICON{hand}% This document is for system administrators. It contains requirements that must be met before beginning the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementInstall][Compute Element Installation]]. 

%STARTINCLUDE%

---+ Operating System and Networking Requirements

   * a working network connection
   * a fully qualified domain name for the gatekeeper
   * working forward and reverse DNS lookup the IP address of the gatekeeper
   * a valid host and service certificates matching the fully qualified domain name
   * use synchronized clock using NTP for all resources constituting the Compute Element 
   * allow outbound network connections, please review the [[ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Document]]

---+ Required Service Accounts

| *Service Name*  | *Account*  | *Comment*  |
| %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM%  | =globus=  | if not present, the =daemon= account will be used  |
| CEMon  | =daemon=  |  |
| RSV  | =rsvuser=  | test with =su -c "/bin/date" rsvuser=  |

---+ Required User Accounts

Unix user accounts need to be created for each %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO%. The =uid= and =name= of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later during the configuration process.  Since VO's are frequently added to the OSG, you should access the current list of registered VO's at [[http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vosummary?datasource=summary&all_vos=on&active_value=1][MyOSG's Virtual Organization menu item]]. Any new VO's will also appear in on the CE in the file =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt=.

---+ Required Host and Service Certificates

The following table lists OSG services that require a service certificate for their operation. Please [[ReleaseDocumentation/GetGridCertificates#Request_a_Service_Certificate][request and install]] the certificates before you proceed with the installation.

| *Purpose*  | *Default Location*  | *Comment*  |
| host  | =/etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem= %BR% =/etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem=  | owned by the =root= account  |
| %LINK_GLOSSARY_GRAM_WS%  | =/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem= %BR% =/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem=  | owned by the =globus= account  |
| RSV  | =/etc/grid-security/rsvcert.pem= %BR% =/etc/grid-security/rsvkey.pem=  | owned by the =rsvuser= acount  |
| CEMon  |  | owned by the =daemon= account  |

---+ Do you have a Grid User Certificate?

As the system administrator you are required to test the functionality provided by the Compute Element. This requires a [[ReleaseDocumentation/CertificateGet][grid user certificate]] issued for you.
