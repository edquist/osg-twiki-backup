Represented OSG at OGF 20, EUgridPMA. MiddleWare Security Group (MWSG) and Joint Security Policy Group (JSPG) meetings.  

Major completed task was the turnover of the site operations policy to the executive council for approval after several iterations and lots of consultation and negotiation with various parties on both sides of the Atlantic to address their separate concerns. This policy statement describes the initial set of expectations that grids have for sites providing resources to the grid community and is considered a minimal requirement for OSG to provide a stable, robust operating environment.

At the EUgridPMA meeting presented a view of the NIST requirements for identity providers with a suggestion that they look at the minimum requirements they have in their profiles with an eye towards those standards rather than discussing in great detail items viewed as relatively unimportant by the standards bodies and missing out on other areas completely. It was taken as a topic to be revisited and I will revise and extend my proposal at the next EUgridPMA meeting in September. The Europeans have an effort known as ISSeG that is trying to map the ISO standards to the grid environment so it seems appropriate to be sure the mapping also with the NIST standards that a number of the OSG sites must  consider in deploying services for OSG.

At the MSWG meeting, brought up and chaired a discussion taken from the OGF 20 comments about the useability problems associated with grid security. What came to light in the discussion was the dismal state of useful user feedback when a problem is encountered in the authz/authn security structure. Of course, the users of the larger VOs will probably not experience these problems since those VOs have managed to create their own middleware that effectively bypasses all the standard grid security infrastructure since they couldn't wait on the "standard" mechanisms to be operational after being promised but not delivered for years.

Performed initial negotiations at JSPG on a proposed privacy policy as it related to operational data. Acted as negotiator between OSG side wanting open access to job data for monitoring and debugging purposes and the EU concerns about data privacy (raised by one lawyer at one site and untested by any case law as to the actual interpretation that should be applied).  The contentious issues here *appear* to be on the path to a satisfactory resolution for both sides of the Atlantic.

Developed and presented at the JSPG meeting a first draft of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo operational policy statement which was approves with minor changes. This draft has been distributed to the OSG security groups and has held up with little comment and only a few suggestions for improvement.

Working to bring together the Shibboleth community and the other authorization developers along with the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS developers into a series of meeting this fall. Meetings may likely culminate with the MiddleWare Security Group meeting at LBL in early December of this year with several opportunities to get various subsets of the developers together before that time.
