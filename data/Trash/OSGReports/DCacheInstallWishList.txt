During installation of the VDT dCache release, the following issues came to my attention. I list them in random order.

Security:<br>
  *  The dCache installation uses the PostgreSQL database system for pnfs, billing records and srm records. Possibly other things. The login name for the SRM DB and the billinginfo DB is srmdcache. The password is also srmdcache. There is no security.
  *  The login name and password appears in over 20 files in /opt/d-cache/config and some scripts in /opt/d-cache/etc. To change the password is to risk breaking something. 

Location:<br>
  *  The VDT installer for dCache is inflexible about the location of what it installs.
dCache is installed in /opt/d-cache. PNFS is installed in /opt/pnfs and /opt/pnfsdb.
 We put the OSG:ce package in /opt/OSG.
I would like to be able to put all the dCache stuff in /opt/OSG/osgse or /opt/OSG/SE, but that wasn't an option.
  *  The machines at my lab are set up with small /opt partitions. Even though the pnfs and d-cache installations use relatively little space on /opt, it is preferrable to install them elsewhere and remount them under /opt. This is painfully difficult. Also, the postgres databases can become quite large, and some control over the disk where they are installed would be helpful. Installing them on the root partition is unsatisfactory.
  *  By default,  dCache puts about 10 log files into /var/log. It would be better if they went into /var/log/d-cache by default. There is a mechanism to change the default. The documentation needs to give clearer advice on the consequences of filling up /var, especially if it is on the root partition.

Gratia Probe for dCache:<br>
  *  To install the dCache probe, the postgres include files are needed. They are not installed as part of VDT dCache release. Ted H. indicated that they would be part of the next VDT dCache release. This would require the probe to be installed on the machine that runs one of the dCache Postgres databases. The dCache probe need not be run on the same host as the postgres database, so the Postgres include files should be delivered with the dCache probe. The problem will be ensuring that the Postgres include files version matches the Postgres version delivered with dCache.
