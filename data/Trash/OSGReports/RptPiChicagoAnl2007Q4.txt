D R A F T - not yet final (26 Feb 2008).

*EDUCATION*

Delivered a 1-day and .5 day OSG Grid workshop at SC07, along with an OSG Education Program presentation

Planning and coordination for 2 January Grid Schools (FIGS08 at FIU and TUGS08 at Tuskegee)

Trash/Trash/Integration of engagement materials into Grid School

Priority concerns: Need to focus more time on the core activities of managing and performing content development, supporting students to become engaged users, and measuring engagement. Need to reduce time that is being diverted on many worthwhile but ancillary activities, meetings and opportunities that continually arise. Technical writer position (.5FTE for OSG) remains open and is needed, but will be hard to staff with a writer with Grid experience. Need to simplify the burden of logistics support for workshop delivery, and obtain better support for these logistics.

*INTEGRATION*

During the release transition of OSG 0.6 to 0.8, several iterations of the VTB were made using a 3-site test bed which permitted quick testing of  pre-release VDT updates, functional tests, and install and configuration scripts.

For OSG 0.8, the ITB was deployed on 12 sites providing compute elements and four sites providing storage elements (dCache and BestMan packages implementing SRM v1.1 and v2.2 protocols); 36 validation processes were defined across these compute and storage resources in readiness for the production release.  Pre-deployment validation of applications from 12 VOs were coordinated with the OSG Users group.

The OSG Release Documentation was developed (a managed set of wiki-based documents that capture install, configure, validation methods used throughout the integration and deployment processes and receives reviewed input from all corners of the OSG community.  

Sites Coordination activity: Two face-to-face meetings have been held; the group met by phone monthly.
