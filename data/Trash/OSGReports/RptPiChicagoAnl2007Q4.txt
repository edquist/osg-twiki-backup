*INTEGRATION*

Key accomplishments
   * During the release transition of OSG 0.6 to 0.8, several iterations of the VTB were made using a 3-site test bed which permitted quick testing of  pre-release VDT updates, functional tests, and install and configuration scripts.
   * For OSG 0.8, the ITB was deployed on 12 sites providing compute elements and four sites providing storage elements (dCache and BestMan packages implementing SRM v1.1 and v2.2 protocols); 36 validation processes were defined across these compute and storage resources in readiness for the production release.  Pre-deployment validation of applications from 12 VOs were coordinated with the OSG Users group.
   * The OSG Release Documentation was developed (a managed set of wiki-based documents that capture install, configure, validation methods used throughout the integration and deployment processes and receives reviewed input from all corners of the OSG community.  
   * A Sites Coordination activity: Two face-to-face meetings have been held; the group met by phone monthly.
