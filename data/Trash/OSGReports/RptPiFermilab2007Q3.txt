---++ Security
---++++ Key accomplishments
   * OSG Security plan have been executed, 70% of the plan so far has been implemented. By the end of December, we expect to complete this. Since we started implementing the plan in July, this would be the biggest accomplishment of this quarter.

   * As part of the OSG security plan, we have been executing a security incident on OSG and measure the response times. This also shows the feasibility of our incident handling procedure.

   * Training to OSG staff is delivered, and security tutorial for site and VO admins are prepared.This will be delieverd at the next Site admins meeting

   * Feedback to JSPG concerning various policy documents.

---++++ Milestones Completed
   * wrote the SOW for next year.
   * completed develop and execute security training
---++++ Staffing Status
I have been hired , but that was in 2nd quarter. So, we are fully staffed.
---++++ Issues and Concerns
Biggest concern right now is completion of the OSG security plan. Based on our implementation and observation, we will revise the plan in the second year. Another concern for us is to determine, and possibly reduce, the amount of travel and meeting requirements from OSG security team members. We are trying to maximize the combined efforts of OSG security team members.
Another issue is to balance OSG participation and leadership in MWSG and other joint security bodies.

---++ Storage VDT
---++++ Key Accomplishments

   * ITB Testing. Test Stand. Phedex. Test Documents. Inca framework. Jython interface. Debug orphan files problem. Privilege ext. Bestman. LIGO, Cornell.
   * Testing of dCache became prominent this quarter. Three test stands were created; a dCache 1.7 instance and FNAL, a dCache 1.8 instance at FNAL, and a dCache 1.8 instance at UCSD. The latter two are of sufficient capacity to test storage at Tier2 rates.
   * OSG storage supported ITB testing and supplied the dCache 1.7 instance listed above. There were also several other dCache installations in ITB testing, and one Bestman instance. 
   * Clients for testing dCache under load were written and applied to create third-party transfers between the FNAL and UCSD test stands. The UCSD test stand also simultaneously recieved load from Phedex transfers, being an endpoint for three Tier2s. The S2 test suite was run against the dCache 1.8 instance.

   * Test plans were written for specific features of dCache of interest to OSG, namely the Replica Manager and the Billing Cell. Scripts for testing the replica manager were created and testing was done on the FNAL ITB test stand. 
   * The Inca software package from Teragrid was studied and chosen as the persistence and display framework for tools. Tests may also be run without the framework and this is the current mode of operation. 
   * In setting up testing, several dCache bugs were found and analysed in detail. This was of help to developers to fix a serious problem in file cleanup on pools.

   * Several package released occurred, for improvement of the installation scripts and to contain dCache patches. A preliminary tools package was made available.


---++++ Milestones Completed
The milestone of operating a test stand was met. The new hardware for the Gridworks test stand arrived and was configured. dCache 1.8 was installed on in it, as described above.

---++++ Staffing 
Tanya Levshina joined the group at 0.70 FTE. Staffing was full during the quarter.

---++++ Concerns and Issues being worked
Load testing continues. Load will be increased to stress the sytem. The Replica Manager will be installed on the GridWorks system and the test scripts run against it. Space reservation will be used on the dCache 1.8 test stands and the space reservation cleaner will be tested. The install scripts will be modified to increase the security of the database servers in dCache.

---++++ Other Observations
There were fewer urgent bugs from dCache 1.8 testing than expected, but more lingering bugs from dCache 1.7. A need for support of srm client tools written at Fermilab has arisen from CMS.
---++ Storage Extensions
---++++ Key accomplishments 
Space reservation cleaner and gridftp Gratia probe were worked on. The former of these is near to completion. The privilege java code was modified to allow the use of spaces in host DNs.
---++++ Staffing 
Still lacking 0.25 FTE for extensions; most effort going into testing and readying of dCache 1.8 which falls under the Storage VDT. 


---++ Project & Budget Management
---++++ Key accomplishments 
<b> Project Management: </b>
Monthly updates of the year1 WBS were processed; quarterly PI reports from each institution were procured and processed into the year1 status report submitted to NSF on July 31.  Status of agency milestones and other key tasks, with special focus on the science milestones, was updated and summarized for review by the OSG Council on August 17; this served as the Year1 OSG Project Review as specified in the year1 WBS.    The year2 draft WBS was refined via review and update by each of the area coordinators; this year2 WBS was translated into year2 SOW drafts covering all 17 institutions.


<b>Budget Management:  </b>
Expenses by institution for the period ending June 30, 2007 were gathered and forwarded to the Resource Managers.  The sub-contract to Iowa was terminated and transition of the residual funding to UIUC was completed via establishment of a new sub-award.   The budget management plan was reviewed with the OSG funding agency liaison, Jim Yeck, on August 8.  Analysis of year1 expenditures was used to create a proposal for meeting certain new year2 work requirements; endorsement of this proposal was solicited and received from the OSG Council.   Based on prior guidance and year1 budget analysis, the year2 budget draft was produced and reviewed/approved by the OSG Executive Team and the OSG Council.
