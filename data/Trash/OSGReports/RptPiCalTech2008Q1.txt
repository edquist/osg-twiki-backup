---+++ Application Support and Workflow Extensions:

   * Began attending weekly meetings with the Binary Inspiral Analysis Software Development Team to communicate ideas for improving usability of the OSG for this LIGO application. Several code changes have been suggested and are underway which will, if successful, allow the binary inspiral application to run across multiple OSG sites, with less storage, simultaneously. The focus of the effort would be to allow for more simulation jobs to be run, improving efficiency calculations. It is important to realise that LIGO simulations use the same data as data analysis so data movement is still important.

   * Successfully carried out simple srmcp of LIGO data between two sites just to get a feel for complexity involved. Began working with the Pegasus developers on support for SRM in Pegasus workflow planning. Encountered an issue early on which is currently being investigated by Karan Vahi.

   * Began testing WS-Gram submission of LIGO workflows at several OSG 0.8.0 sites. Have had successes at a couple of OSG sites but have seen various failures at roughly half a dozen other sites. Working to troubleshoot these issues at various levels of the OSG ranging from GOC to VO Support to site administrators.

   * Continue to make progress running Einstein@Home periodic source application based on BOINC on a few OSG sites. The application requires WS-GRAM and outbound communications from the worker nodes, so the number of sites for which this is an option is limited. Held a teleconference with the developers of the German D-Grid based submission environment to identify ways to make further growth less constrained by site architecture. Chief among these was a set of modifications to the code base to support using Condor-G for submission. This is in the works but no timeline currently exists.

   * Organized and held a two day workshop at ISI to discuss ways to improve workflow management through Pegasus and Condor. The workshop was had a representative or two from each of OSG, LIGO, Condor, Pegasus, CDIGS and CMS as well as the Einstein@Home developers in Germany (via telcon) at various points in the meeting. Many good ideas were presented and several suggestions for concrete tasks were layed out. This is the type of meeting that can really be productive on the small scale.

   * Began comparing the use of Pegasus workflow planning for submission of workflows onto the LIGO Data Grid to understand the differences from submission onto the OSG. This has identified several areas where Pegasus could do things a little bit differently to make the two grids more transparent to the user community, and to improve overall efficiency and performance.

---+++ Integration and Validation Testbed Activities:

   * Caltech was very close to having successfully identified a talented new member for the integration and validation testbed activities. The candidate was identified and viewed very highly by both Caltech and Rob Gardner. An offer was made and accepted. Relocation arrangements were being made when a family crisis forced the individual to reevaluate relocating. We are back to reviewing resumes. I have contacted a couple of applicants but have yet to hear back. 

   * In the meantime, Kent Blackburn has had to make some minor adjustments to the Integration Testbed at Caltech to keep up with CRLs, VO membership and a few important patches. Since a dedicated contact for this cluster can not be identified, Mine has requested that the Caltech ITB be un-registered. Even so, we continue to use the ITB cluster for application development and testing.

---+++ Caltech PI Activities:

   * Worked with the OSG Project Associate (now Project Manager) to provide timely reports and financial information needed for OSG reporting, reviews and financial board meetings.

   * Worked with Miron Livny and Ginny Werner to make the necessary additions and changes to the NSF Fastlane to be added as an OSG co-PI.

   * Attended OSG All-Hands-Meeting in Chapel Hill. Organized a sidebar meeting with Abhishek, Chris, Britta and myself to develop a plan for improving troubleshooting issues with LIGO's large complex workflows while running on the OSG. Hope to have Britta running some of the VO test scripts Chris has developed soon.

---+++ Resource Manager Activities:

   * Presented on the status and planning of the OSG project and resource management to the Joint DOE/NSF External Review of OSG at the NSF in Washington DC in January. This was used as an opportunity to present to the JOT and the external reviewers the importance of planning for the future of the OSG beyond the current funding cycle.

   * Worked with the OSG Executive Team to finde a security replacement for Bob Cowles at UIUC (James Basney). This required modifications to both the SLAC and the UIUC Statements of Work which were reviewed and signed off as the resource co-manager in a timely manner.

   * I stepped down as the Resource co-Manager to accept a the new role as the OSG Council co-Chair along with Paul Avery.

---+++ LIGO VO Manager Activities:

   * Worked with Mine Altunay to identify contact information for LIGO VO security and incident response at all LIGO sites. This required approval from the LIGO Computer Committee, so I worked closely with them to get the go-ahead. 

   * Worked with Anne Heavey to draft out a article on LIGO's use of the OSG for its periodic (pulsar) source search method know as Einstein At Home. Expect to push out this article in coincidence with a forthcoming LIGO scientific publication.

   * Worked with Users Group (Abhishek in particular) to define LIGO requests for future OSG releases, starting with 1.0.0. Also provided a timeline for what would be most beneficial to LIGO along with what could be pushed back to a later date.

---+++ OSG Council Chair Activities:

   * Was nominated and elected into the role of OSG Council co-Chair, along with Paul Avery. Since accepting this position, I have been working to form several ad-hoc subcommittees to address important issues facing the OSG Council.

   * I have revamped the OSG Council Website to provide for better communications, organization, planning and accounting of the activities of the OSG Council.
