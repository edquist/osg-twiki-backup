---+WBS Status Update Process

---++Overview
The WBS Status update process periodically loads the latest WBS table into the OSG twiki; this table is exported from the master .mpp project file.  Normally, this table will be loaded by the OSG Project Associate once a month near the beginning of the month.  At that point an email will be sent to all WBS owners inviting them to use the WBS Status Editor to update the status of the WBS rows for which they are responsible.  Typically this email trigger will be sent in the first week of the month and the window of opportunity for updates will stay open for about two weeks thereafter.  After the update window has expired, the changes entered by WBS owners will be transported to the master .mpp file and an updated version of the WBS table will be loaded into Twiki table editor for the next round of updates.

---++How to invoke the WBS Status Editor
Go to the OSGReports Web home page (the parent of this page) and invoke the link labelled [[OSGReports/UpdateWbs][WBS Status Editor]]
