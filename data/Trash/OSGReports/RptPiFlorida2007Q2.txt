OSG funds were received and processed at Florida in June 2007, near the end of Q2. Craig Prescott of Florida placed an ad that month for a graduate student to perform education and training duties focussing on OSG documentation and Site Admin training. Late in June he and Paul Avery interviewed and hired Siddhartha Srivatsan, a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, for the position.

The plan, developed at the very end of Q2, is that Siddhartha will work full time with Craig during the summer while he becomes familiar with grid and computing cluster technologies. He will make two trips to Fermilab for a Site Admin training and another meeting devoted to education and outreach. He will also help with student training workshops organized by Mike Wilde. Further descriptions of these and other activities will be described in the Q3 report.
