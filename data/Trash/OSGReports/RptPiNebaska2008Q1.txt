---+!! 2008Q1 PI Quarterly Report

<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

During Q1 2008, Nebraska started with the OSG PI program; a staff member, Brian Bockelman, started to work on the OSG at the rate of .5 FTE.  Brian's work is for the monitoring and metrics portion of the OSG WBS.  He has worked on establishing metrics for Year 2, centralizing measurements for OSG-related activities, coordinating with the Gratia external project, and started a historical record of the GIP data.  The GIP work has been very useful, and its results have provided the OSG with a preliminary means to measure the "size" of the OSG with respect to the number of cores and total SI2K score.  Further, the GIP work will be used to measure the site's normalization constant for WLCG sites, which has been a manual process for the GOC until now (sometimes resulting in inaccurate data).


There are currently no areas of dire concerns; however, because Brian was on sabbatical in the latter half of March, we will need to pay close attention to the timeliness of the WBS deliverables.  Additionally, some of Brian's activities (such as a large amount of improvement work on the GIP) are only indirectly implied by the WBS.
