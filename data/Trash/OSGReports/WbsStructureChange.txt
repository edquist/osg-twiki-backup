---++WBS Structure Change Process & Instructions

Changes to the structure of the WBS are made by completing a change control request:

   * Structural changes are defined as 
      * deletion of a WBS line
      * creation of an new WBS line
      * moving a WBS line to become a "child" of another higher level summary task

   * The Change Control process is defined in OSG Document Database # 523

   * Completed WBS change control requests are "posted" (stored) in OSG Document Database # 538 and then a notification is sent the Resource Managers requesting action on the change request.
