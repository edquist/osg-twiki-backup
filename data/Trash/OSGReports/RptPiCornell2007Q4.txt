Projects completed by Greg Sharp in Q4 2007:
* modification of dCache Space Reservation manager to support "garbage collection" (WBS 4.4.9.2, WBS 4.4.1)
* Jython package to enable simple script authoring by site admins for execution of dCache Admin server commands. (WBS 4.4.9.2)
* scripts for listing expired/released Space Reservations and their associated files (WBS 4.4.1)
* python script that extracts the dynamic dCache information: pool capacity and usage (from dCache admin server) , space reservation capacity and usage (from Space reservation postgres database) (WBS 4.4.1)
* new Gratia probe to report storage capacity and usage of dCache (added after initial Y2 SOW)
* updated dCache transfer probe to address performance problems on very large databases
The WBS 4.4.1 milestone has been met in this quarter, in addition to the new dCache storage capacity probe.  Good progress has been made towards the WBS 4.4.9.2 milestone.  Work has been initiated on the WBS 4.4.9.1 milestone.

Sharp has initiated contact with Globus (Fraser) to push on the hardening of their data collection "listener" daemon that writes the information to a postgres DB, as well as on the gridFTP server patches needed for OSG to add the information sent to the server.  Once that information is flowing properly to the listener (tests by Sharp of the CE gridftp message logging to the listener failed in December), the grid FTP gratia probe can be implemented (WBS 4.4.2.1).  As a result, the WBS 4.4.2.1 milestone is delayed pending the prerequisite Globus work.
