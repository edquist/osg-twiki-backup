   * Key accomplishments

Prepared for, coordinated and presented at the  OSG NSF/DOE review on January 22, 23; led answering the reviewers questions, coordinating the work and presentations,  the agenda and coordinating with the Joint Oversight Team. Coordinated the program and arrangements for the ALl Hands Meeting at RENCI, together with the local organizing committee. Coordinating Quarterly meetings with the main scientific stakeholders. US ATLAS, US CMS, D0, CDF and LIGO held to date. Following up on science milestones with the science stakeholders. Attended and presented at  NSF workshop on Building Effective Virtual Organizations, Genomes to Life DOE workshop; poster at the DOE ASCR CS PI meeting; 

Member of the WLCG Management Board representing OSG. Working with the Facility on delivering the milestones for Site Availability and Reliability to meet the WLCG MOU.  Working with communications group on monthly newsletter.  Attended the March Council meeting and was elected for a further 2 year term.  Completed OSG requirements from the Gratia external project and negotiating agreement with the line and project management.

  * Milestones completed

External project review.  Monthly metric sent to the JOT

   * Staffing status (how much is to be hired and status)

Concerns at continuing inability to hire staff at Caltech, UCSD and Wisconsin and at overload of staff at University of Indiana.
Successful advertising of job description and agreement to have Jim Basney at the UIUC replace security effort at SLAC.

   * Concerns and Issues being Worked

Response from the reviewers, including follow up on planning between LIGO and OSG. Lack of sufficient staff for QA, extensions and users support and follow up work in operations and troubleshooting.  Replacement Resources Manager, now existing RMs have transitioned to be the Council co-Chairs.Lack of usable tools and interfaces for monitoring and troubleshooting of job and data transfer status.  Need for LHC client tools.

---+++ Security: 

   * Key accomplishments 

We completed the revision of security plan. This was a milestone as well.
We completed the OSG privacy policy. We prepared the templates of VO AUP and VO Registration Policies and sent these to the VO contacts to be filled out.
We updated the VO contact database. We identified the problem that many VOs are unable to provide incident response contacts except business hours. We are still working to solve this problem.
We performed another fire drill and noticed a problem with GUMS updates. We worked with each site to solve this problem.
We had another incident at INFN. The nature of this incident made us re-think OSG's and its members' responsibilities to prevent incidents. We are working on a detailed incident response flowchart, along with questionnaires to be asked to security contacts during an incident.
We made software requests to our software vendors for a banning tool. (in progress)
We started testing with an indexing tool to help us with forensics investigation.(in progress)

   * Milestones completed

revise of second year security plan


   * Staffing status (how much is to be hired and status)
We hired Jim Basney 50%FTE and Ron Cudcewicz 50% FTE.

   * Concerns and Issues being Worked
My current challenge is to balance the workload for each security team member. Since the entire team (except myself) is half-time, I am having trouble keeping track of the time spent by team members for the OSG. Often team members switch between their jobs and I do not have a clear picture of whether I am overspending or underspending their OSG time. I started asking a weekly report from each member and posting action items on the security twiki page.

---+++ Storage

*   Key accomplishments
         o RPM packaging of dCache Gratia probes has been completed.
         o dCache GIP probes for glue schema 1.3 are in testing.
         o LCG-Utils has been built on the VDT Metronome platform for SL4.
         o Validation test scripts for Fermi clients, SRM-dCache Space
           Manager, and dCache Replica Manager have been completed.
         o VDT and ITB testing for OSG 1.0 included VDT packaging of
           dCache 1.8 and Bestman.
   * Milestones completed
         o First version of OSG Storage Toolkit has been completed and
           is in testing.
         o Bestman-xrootd now supports all SRM v2.2 functions.
   * Staffing status (how much is to be hired and status)
   * Concerns and Issues being Worked
         o Testing of new probes, tools, and software releases continues
         o Working with developers on features needed for opportunistic
           storage and extensions
         o Expanding platforms for LCG-Utils support


---+++  User Support
    *  Key Accomplishments
          o Published completed registration work-flow and VO AUP documents.
    * Milestones completed
    * Concerns and issues being worked
          o After the All-Hands meeting, OSG ED and PI have asked that the VO testing suite be aggressively marketed to all VOs with support to set up regular testing and collation of results across VOs.
          o Multi-disciplinary work is in progress to reduce the time needed to solve complex problems experienced by LIGO, which has a unique workflow and is prone to otherwise rare interactions between different middleware and applications.
          o Pilots, glExec and MPI use for OSG VOs being developed actively and nearing critical functionality.
    * Other important / relevant observations
          o General user interactions and support work ongoing.
          o Planning for face-to-face at BNL has started and dates are set.
          o All-Hands meeting was useful for speaking with users, site reps and others and collecting input on a range of issues.


---+++ Project & Resource Management: 

   * Key accomplishments 

We completed the planning and execution of the OSG NSF/DOE review on January 22, 23; this included a lead role in creating material for the review covering: 1) the financial summary, 2) recap of year1 WBS, 3) planning and status of year2 work plan, and 4) a concept level plan for OSG beyond the current funded interval. 
<p>
 A similar and slightly updated view of OSG was prepared and presented to the OSG Council meeting on March 6, 2008.  In addition, we worked with BNL, LBNL, FNAL, and Wisconsin to submit a consolidated view (FWP) of DOE funding needed for the year starting 4/1/2008.  And during this quarter we initiated the process of Area Coordinator progress review meetings to enable better communication and management of the work program.  Another key item was the kick-off of quarterly meetings with the various experiments to understand their goals, work plans and issues so that OSG can factor those into its work program.

---+++ User and Internal Communications

   * Key accomplishments 
OSG Communications staff from FNAL has worked closely with FNAL's VMS department to create a research highlights brochure and a set of posters.  The brochure is near completion, the posters still in early development. In other outreach work, we contributed to an article intended for publication by SciDAC, and we sent our 2007 physics highlights to NSF for publication. We published a January and a joint Feb-Mar newsletter.
 
We have continued to evolve and update the website and calendar.  We've worked to standardize the look and feel of the collaborative workspace wiki, and updated content.
 
We worked on preparations for the external review in late January.
 
We've contributed (written two, collected three) five articles to isgtw: "Massively parallel: NERSC, OSG and HPC" http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1000952, "Getting started with grid computing: engage with OSG" http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1000928, "Stormy weather: grid computing powers fine-scale climate modeling" http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1000860, "Computing the unseen: the search for dark matter" http://www.isgtw.org/?pid=1000847; "Matchmaking for Science: RENCI connects researchers with computing resources on the OSG" (from RENCI, not published in isgtw yet).

    * Concerns and issues being worked

Making the best web site possible in the face of many differing requirements
<p>
getting engagement of OSG contributors and staff to help review and correct Twiki pages.


---+++ OSG to TeraGrid Gateway

   * Key Accomplishments:

    During this period, we have successfully demonstrated the transparent forwarding of ws-gram jobs from a system configured
to operate as an OSG to TeraGrid gateway to a (preconfigured)  TeraGrid system.

   * Milestones Completed:

    See above.

   * Concerns and Issues being Worked:

    The OSG-TeraGrid gateway work is currently focusing on the
required information systems.  The TeraGrid information
system is based on MDS4 and the OSG information system is
based on CEMon (Condor ClassAds).  In order to transparently link these two information systems, a translation function
or utility is needed.  There are indications that prior  work may be applicable, and this is currently being researched.
If prior work is not applicable, then development of the
translation function will be required to implement the full functionality of the OSG to TeraGrid Gateway.
