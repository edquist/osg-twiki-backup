Security: 


   * Key accomplishments 

We completed the revision of security plan. This was a milestone as well.
We completed the OSG privacy policy. We prepared the templates of VO AUP and VO Registration Policies and sent these to the VO contacts to be filled out.
We updated the VO contact database. We identified the problem that many VOs are unable to provide incident response contacts except business hours. We are still working to solve this problem.
We performed another fire drill and noticed a problem with GUMS updates. We worked with each site to solve this problem.
We had another incident at INFN. The nature of this incident made us re-think OSG's and its members' responsibilities to prevent incidents. We are working on a detailed incident response flowchart, along with questionnaires to be asked to security contacts during an incident.
We made software requests to our software vendors for a banning tool. (in progress)
We started testing with an indexing tool to help us with forensics investigation.(in progress)

   * Milestones completed

revise of second year security plan


   * Staffing status (how much is to be hired and status)
We hired Jim Basney 50%FTE and Ron Cudcewicz 50% FTE.

   * Concerns and Issues being Worked
My current challenge is to balance the workload for each security team member. Since the entire team (except myself) is half-time, I am having trouble keeping track of the time spent by team members for the OSG. Often team members switch between their jobs and I do not have a clear picture of whether I am overspending or underspending their OSG time. I started asking a weekly report from each member and posting action items on the security twiki page.
