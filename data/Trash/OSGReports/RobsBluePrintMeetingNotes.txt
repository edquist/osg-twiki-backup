---++ Organization of blueprint meetings
Discussing the nature of the blueprint meetings, who should be there, how they should be organized.
   * Miron: 1 day, noon-to-noon, every 6 weeks
   * Less operational, but more architectural and open-ended discussions; for example, discussing a new service (eg. FTS)
   * Not the place to make decisions (need buy-in from stakeholders) -- but to discuss directions and form some agreements.
   * Where?  Chicago-airports.
   * Agenda.  Need a person to drive the agenda and be responsible for organization.  
   * BP Meetings
      * Feb 1-2
      * April 19-20
      * May 31-June 1
   * EB Meetings
      * Jan 24 or 25
