---+!! OSG Blueprint Meeting Notes


---++ Introduction
   * These are sketchy, non-official notes.
   * 


---++ Organization of blueprint meetings
Discussing the nature of the blueprint meetings, who should be there, how they should be organized.
   * Miron: 1 day, noon-to-noon, every 6 weeks
   * Less operational, but more architectural and open-ended discussions; for example, discussing a new service (eg. FTS)
   * Not the place to make decisions (need buy-in from stakeholders) -- but to discuss directions and form some agreements.
   * Where?  Chicago-airports.
   * Agenda.  Need a person to drive the agenda and be responsible for organization.  
   * BP Meetings
      * Feb 1-2
      * April 19-20
      * May 31-June 1
   * EB Meetings
      * Jan 24 or 25

---++ Exponential backoff on CEs
   * Need a configurable service that senses the load on the gatekeeper, and rejects jobs from a client and giving a message back.
   * Environmentally aware software - components which sense enviromental factors such as load and makes decisions accordingly.
   * Eg. Linux memory manager which senses over-usage and kills the largest offender, often a database.
   * Other examples are the monitoring scripts.  Worries about cron jobs, eg. whether they are still running.
   * What is the message exchange pattern needed?  Don discussing way its done in storage - how one gets into the queue.

---++ FTS and storage
   * Put this as a topic on the next meeting.
   * What pieces are we going to make part of the OSG infrastructure.
   * Esp. managed storage.
   * Where do we start the discussion, how do we even have it?
   * For FTS, only that the client be on the infrastructure - eg.  on the WN.
   * Long discussion of srm, xrootd, gridftp, drm
   * what about dpm?
   * Are we supporting srm?

---+++ OSG storage issues 
   * Ask atlas and cms mgt for % of deployed space for general osg use
   * storage authz deployment
   * owners being overloaded by non-owners due to fifo nature of srm

---++ 

---++ Efficiency
   * What do we need to improve efficiency from 50% to 75%/100%.

---++ Security
   * Don.
