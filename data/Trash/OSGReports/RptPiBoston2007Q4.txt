Quarterly report for October-December 2007: Boston University

During this quarter, we worked on the following items:    
    
a) Made improvements to the Pacman development and release
infrastructure, moving Pacman to cvs, fixing problems in file
permissions and modifying the testing framework needed due to
changes in the NMI testbed, where we do most of our pre-release
testing.  

b) Consulted with the VDT team on questions relating to the OR
and "fail" language elements, handling of CentOS flavors, 
"linux-rhel-4" and http proxies.

c) Improved the use of wget internally, reacting better if
wget is not installed and improving options which force updating
of squid cached web pages, responding to requests from Steve
Timm and Adam Kocoloski.

d) Fixed a bug in the generated pre- and post- setup scripts.

e) Did an extensive investigation of a problem that Terrence 
Martin had updating PRIMA-GT4 (related to us by Alain Roy).  The
investigation eventually revealed a bug in how errors are reported
in Pacman.  The bug was fixed.

f) Designed the build/installation/update component of "egg".
