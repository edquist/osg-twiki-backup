---+++ Key Accomplishments

   * Started transporting RSV records to the WLCG SAM for Availability calculations. The transport is now working correctly, we are still working on publishing all of the records to correctly report Availability and Reliability statistics.

   * Began a series of 'Fire Drills' to test the OSG security mechanisms. The first tests check on the CRL update times with and without notification to the Resource admins.

   * Retired !GridCat monitoring software.

---+++ Milestones Completed

   * Released OSG 0.8.0 software stack. Along with updated GOC services to handle changes to the CE, SE, GUMS, and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS packages.

---+++ Staffing Status 

   * The GOC was fully staffed during the 4th Quarter of 2007.

   * Added a 0.5 FTE funded by IU to do System Administration.

---+++ Issues and Concerns

   * !MonALISA needs to be shutdown, we have hosted this as an optional service for several months, but it is time to turn it off.

   * GOC Service infrastructure has grown organically, we need some time to put things in order, this will take several maintenances and we are targeting post release of the OSG 1.0.0 middleware package.
