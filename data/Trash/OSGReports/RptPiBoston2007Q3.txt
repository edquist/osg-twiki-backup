Quarterly report for the period July-September 2007: BU Subcontract "Pacman"

In the period July-September 2007, Pacman related activities at BU consisted in 
improvements made in releases 3.20 and 3.21, feedback provided to OSG members
and one major new feature: "Pacballs".  Pacballs are machine independent, self-contained,
self-installing, md5 checksummed files which are designed for grid installation of Pacman 
defined software.  A pacball is created simply by replacing "-get" with "-pacball" in 
any Pacman install.  The resulting file can then be installed simply by executing it as 
a bash script - it is not necessary to have Pacman setup at the point of installation or to
have internet access.  Pacballs are then convenient both for grid installation and as 
a way of guaranteeing identical software environments (via the md5 checksum of the
installation).  

    More routine support activities included:
    
o Improvement in Platform handling of "clones" like RHEL-4/CentOS-4/Rocks-4/SLC-4

o Fixed problems with Ubuntu and Yellos Dog OS recognition, added support for Gentoo.

o Fixed problems with -lock-override

o Improved error messages generated via wget.

o Improved -http-proxy handling

o Improved rpm handling

o Added an option to force updating if an http-cache is in use

o Fixed several small bugs

o Speed up the internal parser (A contribution of Alain Roy).

o Adding or moving symbolic cache names as requested

o Performing and improving our suite of pre-release tests performed on all 18 supported
  operating systems (many done using the NMI testbed facility at U.W.).

o Interacted with OSG users on a semi-continuous basis offering support and helping
  the VDT team track down problems when Pacman issues are thought to be a potential cause
  of some observed problem.
  
This work was performed by John Brunelle at BU, supervised by Saul Youssef.
