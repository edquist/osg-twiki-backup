   to remove the ambiguity of how many jobs are running on the OSG
   version running on the DGRID. Previously these were all lumped
   together under one user. This will allow us to report to the OSG
   the number of science driven credits the OSG is contributing 
   relative to the CPU hours being used there.

    and job execution.

   * Troubleshooting the Error 106 at RCAC, CIT, SPRACE: 
      preemption with signal 9 is suspected and may be due to the batch
      system not providing sufficient time for jobs to store state info.
   
   *  make minor changes and test cleanup script, add 3 new error codes
    to the cases which require cleaning
   
   *   modifying submission script to prevent job fail at preemption and
    currently testing.

   * Open GOC tickets: Can't run ws-gram job at

     OCI-NSF, RSV wish list, voms-proxy issue

   * Updated DASWG page: OSG-LIGO


* EINSTEIN AT HOME ON THE GRID ACTIVITIES:

   * Effort is underway to upgrade the job submission management
       software to support both WS-GRAM and pre-WS-GRAM.
       Current status:

      * Robert cut stable version GEO600-1.2.x (01/27), fixed bug 02/07

         * Attempt to deploy code on osg-job.ligo.caltech.edu:
           (02/06) --osg-jon down until next week
           ssh osg-job.ligo.caltech.edu
           ssh: connect to hostosg-job.ligo.caltech.edu
           port 22: No route to host
 
         * 02/09 (head node) Trash/Deployment successful at: Purdue-RCAC, 
           NEMO, 
           SPRACE, BNL_ATLAS_1, CIT_CMS_T2, AGLT2, OUHEP_OSG, STAR_BNL

         * Test runs + trouple shooting 02/10, 02/11:
            
            * Nebraska test runs fail: need WN deploy
              (can't find certain perl modules due to
              architecture difference of head node and WNs)
              WN deploy at Nebraska fails: can't find
              $GLOBUS_USER_HOME/deployment dir
           
            * OUHEP_OSG ~20 successful jobs --> GT2
           
            * STAR_BNL (GT2)(thttp proxy ?)
           
            * NEMO (GT2)(http proxy?), 
           
            * CIT_CMS_T2 (GT2/GT4) 
           
            * SPRACE  (GT4, GT2)fail 

      * Maintain GT4 activity on 7 OSG sites with old code:

         * Recent Average Credit (RAC): 52,183.45522 (down 9000) 

         * E@H rank based on RAC: 12 (+1)

         * E@H rank based on accumulated Credits: 60 (+6)

         * Daily manual cleanup

         * High failures at SPRACE, RCAC, CIT_CM_T2,
           ANTAEUS down (02/06 ++)

         * No activity on Nebraska


* BINARY INSPIRAL APPLICAITON ON THE GRID ACTIVITIES:

   * In preparation for the S6 science run, injection (only) work-flows
      using one weeks worth of data for the highmass search are
      run on several OSG sites. The aim is to determine suitable OSG
      sites to run the analysis on within the time frame of a week
      and without any failures. Current status:

      * GUC of pegasus tar ball fails at some sites (contacted Karan
        02/02, contacted Xin at BNL_ATLES_1 02/10)

      * Test runs at LDG/OSG without pegasus stage-in, data pinned to
        disk at Caltech (02/02):

         * UCSDT2, lsu: tmpltbank fail: can't glob frame files, checked  
                         files in remote dir--> ok, LIGO software bug 
                         again??

         * llo (61 hr), NEMO (28 hr)

         * CIT_CMS hangs at data transfer

         * BNL_ATALS_1, lho running


      * Test PEGASUS RPMs on spud

         * get highmas code onto spud:(02/06) 32 bit code

         * test ihope run on LIGO-UWM_NEMO, cit from spud ---> condor 
           problem on spud, Phil contacted Jamie Frey, 
         *   waiting for response

   * *Week 3* *

* GENERAL

   * Third draft of poster for OSG All Hands meeting --> edited by Kent  
     --> printed  02/18

   * Attended LIGO-Pegasus, Coding, DASWG, OSG-VO-GROUP, High
     Mass telecons, OSG-INTEGRATION telecons

   * Wrote agenda and led LIGO-Pegasus and OSG-VO-Group telecons

   * Open GOC tickets:RSV wish list
                      BNL_ATLAS_1 gridftp with http source

   * Closed tickets: OCI-NSF (try running in near future, re-open if 
                              problems)
                     UCSDT2 - architecture differences cause problem 
                              when running tmpltbank
                     LONI, OSG_LIGO_MIT - declared  not operational 
                                          until further notice
