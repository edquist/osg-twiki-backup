November / December

MWSG meeting: The first afternoon consisted of presentations by representatives of several projects external to EGEE but of great interest to the EGEE and OSG community. In the next day, we primarily spent it discussion the various authorization models in use between EGEE and OSG , and discussing future directions while maintaining interoperability.

JSPG meeting: We started with discussions of the current state of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and with possible issues around the recent CMS misuse incident.  Representatives of CERN Legal provided us with suggestions about how to structure our policy documents. Results of the 2nd Security Service Challenge were discussed.  The main topic of the last day was a revision of the top level security policy document to meet an EGEE deliverables deadline of the end of the year.

TAGPMA meeting: There were a number of updates and new applications for Certification Authorities reviewed. Frank Hecker from the Mozilla Foundation gave a presentation on the steps for getting roots or trust included in Mozilla software products.  There was a heated (and as yet unresolved) discussion about host and service certificates and what it means to issue a certificate for them.

Internet2 Federated Identity BOF: Shib implementers meet the girds and what are the requirements?  I participated in a panel discussion of the requirements the grids had for identity providers, and in particular where the providers had a Shib interface to send attributes. There was a lot of discussion around the face-to-face "should" requirement. TerraGrid was very interested in moving ahead wuickly.

Participated in weekly OSG Security teleconferences and in email list discussions.


January:


EUgridPMA meeting: The EUgridPMA met for 3 days in Abingdon, UK. In addition to reviewing the new memberships requests from a number of new Certification Authorities, there was an extensive review of the Member Integrated Certification System (MICS) profile and hopefully the results will be approved by the other PMAs at their next meetings.  Other contentious issues were raised and discussed like the meaning of host/service certificates and what did they really mean and who was responsible for them; and what is the requirement for a face-to-face meeting. Also of interest were the Thawte WebofTrust signing and the PGP signing that I participated in.
