---+++ Key Accomplishments
Staff at UIUC played a key role in investigating and addressing various problems reported by VOs and Users.  Leading the troubleshooting team, we addressed numerous issues including:

   * LIGO workflow problems: LIGO reported problems running their workflows at  two sites STAR_BNL and  TTU_ANTAEUS (ticket #4479, #4480).  On STAR-BNL the problem was resolved by upgrading to Condor 7.0.0. The initial problem at TTU_ ANTAEUS turned out that the WN client software was not updated to 0.8.0, after this was resolved LIGO started running into issues that appeared to be application-specific and at their request further debugging was postponed (and ticket was closed) since they were reportedly working on a new piece of software. Last week (Apr 10) LIGO contacted us to restart the debugging process and we are currently working on it. This problem has been documented at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/LigoWFStarAndTTU.
   * Campaign to help sites upgrade to 0.8.0: We helped resolve problems raised during OSG 0.8.0 installations. These include tickets 4555, 4561 (MIT_CMS), 4589 (Clemson), 4606 (OSG_LIGO_MIT).  In the case of 4589 we figured out that the problem was caused because edg-mkgridmap was not running.  We believe that at configuration time we can detect, if prima call out files are present, if not we should automatically enable edg-mkgridmap. This will be especially useful for inexperienced administrators. In turned out that the problem identified in #4606 was caused by a bug in verify-gip-for-cemon package, which was triggered when there was only one CEUniqueID. This has been fixed in the ITB 0.9.0 release. Information about campaign can be found at: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/CampaignSiteInstallation.
   * OSG All Hands Meeting: Attended the all hands meeting and made presentation on &#8220;Logging and Troubleshooting&#8221;
   * Problems with authorization when using grid-proxy-init vs voms-proxy-init with GUMS: This problem was forwarded by the Security Team and it turned out that the problem was caused by an error in gums template on the CE.
   * GIP: Based on the interaction with the storage group, we updated configure_gip and configure-osg-gip.sh to configure GIP to publish additional storage attributes.

---+++ Milestones Completed

   * Troubleshooting FAQ to help OSG Users: In order to help VOs quickly resolve their problems we put together a list of frequently asked questions that will the troubleshooting of challenging problems.
