The effort at Berkeley Lab are in the areas of Integration,
Storage, and Security.

---++ Integration
The integration work is performed on two small clusters, NERSC_VTB0 and LBNL_VTB.
Each is configured (and reconfigured) for testing various features and services of
OSG software.  NERSC_VTB0 uses the SGE batch system as an aid
to supporting the SGE jobmanager for OSG.  The LBNL_VTB cluster uses the PBS batch system
(Torque), which is one of the systems used on several OSG sites.  This has been used for
scalability testing of PBS since there have been reports that PBS has
difficulty supporting the large number of batch jobs typical of the pleasantly parallel
workload of experimental particle and nuclear physics.
Other specific services and features tested include
   * WS-GRAM
   * SRM testing
   * install tests of VDT 1.7.0
   * install tests of VDT 1.7.1
   * syslog-ng
Results of testing contributed to documentation and fixing installation issues.

---++ Storage
Continued SRM server testing and result publication for current SRM v2.2 implementations.
There were enhancements made to the daily test results published at http://datagrid.lbl.gov.
The problems identified on the monitored SRM sites were reported to those sites for
troubleshooting.  The srm-tester-2 and srm-tester-1 were packaged and included in to VDT.
The implementations being tested are
   * SRM/CASTOR (CERN)
   * SRM/dCache (FNAL)
   * SRM/DPM (CERN)
   * SRM/StoRM (INFN)
   * SRM/BeSRM (LBNL) 

A load testing program of the LBNL SRM implementation (BeStMan) was
constructed and is being carried out for a use case to match the expected STAR workload.
After resolving some issues and bug fixes the tests are proceeding very well
for up to 40 simultaneous jobs writing to the same SRM server.  The stress testing
will continue up to 100 simultaneous jobs writing to a single SRM server.

LBNL is participating in the OSG Storage Activity in developing the testing and monitoring
procedure for Storage Elements beyond the level of SRM protocol compliance.
 
---++ Security

The OSG Registration Authority in this period 600 certificate requests were processed by Agents of the OSG RA, another 1800 host and service certificates were issued using the pre-authorized GridAdmin interface, and 160 personal certificates were renewed via the self-authenticated renewal interface.  There was also some planning and discussion
with ESnet, and administrators from BNL and FNAL on issues and ideas for managing large numbers of host certificates. There is a feature of the RedHat Certificate System software (RHCS) that could be used effectively, which is not currently
used as part of the DOEGrids services, however there are issues about the email notification features
which would need to be resolved before an implementation plan can be completed.

The collaborative project with OSG, ESnet and LIGO to make adjustments to the DOEGrids Certification Authority interfaces to better suit the needs of LIGO was completed in this period. This included changes in the script interfaces as well as email notification characteristics. The detailed description of the project is at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Security/OsgLigoIdAuthz. These adjustments coincided with a deployment of major upgrade to a new version of the RHCS software used for the DOEGrids CA on July 5.

We held the weekly OSG security meetings regularly. There were two minor security vulnerabilities covered in this period. The following policy documents being developed by the Joint Security Policy Group (JSPG) were considered:
   * Grid Security Policy - a framework document for all detailed documents
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Registration Policy
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Operations Policy
   * Grid Site Operations Policy
   * Policy on Personal Logged Information
   * Incident Response for Grid Hosts 
Carrying the input from OSG and participating in the JSPG meetings
is primarily the responsibility of the SLACa effort in OSG.
