Status Report on OSG EOT activities at Columbia University (04/20/07)

Columbia University is collaborating with the University of the Witwatersrand (&#8220;Wits&#8221;) in South Africa to commission and maintain an OSG site at Wits.  Our goals during this period are to establish a small (5-10 core) cluster at Wits and to begin the training of a Site Administrator/Developer for the site.  OSG funds will provide partial support for the Site Administrator/Developer, and Wits has now secured additional funding to make this a full-time position.  

A Site Administrator/Developer started work on cluster activities on 04/01/07.  Due to delays in establishing the funding flow from OSG via Columbia to Wits, this work is currently being supported by non-OSG funds.  The specifications of the initial cluster are now finalized, and as soon as funds arrive, equipment purchases will begin.  In addition to technical support through Ben Clifford and Mike Wilde of OSG EOT, there is a significant interest from members of the DOSAR community in helping launch this effort in South Africa.  Dodd and Clifford plan on attending a meeting of DOSAR participants in late May to define what help can be provided, and to explore whether the Wits group might become a member of DOSAR.
