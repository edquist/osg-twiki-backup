I've been working on GUMS version 1.2.  Changing gums.config can be done from the web now.  All the administrative commands are also available through the web.  It also lists the manual user group members and manual account mappings.  Besides being able to map a grid identity to a local account, one can also map from a local account to one or more grid identities.  It also allows for 3 degrees of privilege, read self, read all, and write.  All these additions were requests from various GUMS users.

I am currently working on the xml tranform from the old version of gums.config as well as adding a schema for gums.config to catch structural problems for adminstrators who still want to edit the file by hand. Another big step is to get a good testing plan and test code in place.
