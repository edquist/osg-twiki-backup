---+!! 2008Q1 PI Quarterly Report

<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

*Milestones to meet this quarter:*
1.5.4 Integrate 1st new additional campus grid

*Satus:*
Delayed

*Challenges:*
Due to delays in getting the subcontract setup from University of Wisconsin the milestone has slipped. Staff has not been hired or funded to do the work. All work has been achieved by Sebastien Goasguen without funding. 

*Results:*
   * A campus grid workshop was run during the OSG AHM meeting. This seems to have been a successful meeting, however follow up needs to happen
   * As a result of CIdays in NY, Buffalo, Albany and RIT are developing campus grids with condor. As of today however none are officially on OSG
   * University Texas El-Paso sent an invitation to be a speaker at their Cyber-Share center (Ann Gates) in september.
   * New Jersey Education Network (http://www.njedge.net/) has contacted us about joining OSG.
   * Hands on work has been given to Ian Stokes Reese at Harvard to bring SBRGRID resources on-line.
   * Clemson put a new resource on-line on ITB: Clemson-KVM made of virtual machines. This could prove useful for an OSG "Live CD"
   * Clemson-IT site is now reporting usage to Gratia and accepting jobs from Engage and nanohub (however these are linux cycles not windows)
   * Clemson economic professor Paul Wilson has joined Engage and is running on OSG using the Jobrouter developed for CMS.

*Latest Achievement:*
A NSF proposal from the CI-TEAM program of the Office of Cyberinfrastructure has been funded. UNC Chapell Hill with John Trash.ManagementMcGee as PI is the lead, Clemson is a subcontractor with Sebastien Goasguen as Co-PI. This award is strongly tied to OSG as it expands on the engagement efforts and provides funding for campus grids efforts.
