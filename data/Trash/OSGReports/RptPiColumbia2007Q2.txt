The group at the University of the Witwatersrand ("Wits") has made good progress in establishing their pilot cluster during this Quarter.  A Site Administrator/Developer, Norman Ives, began work on the cluster commissioning on 04/01/07, supported by local funds from Wits.  Ives is a graduate student in the Physics Department at Wits, with a strong background in theoretical physics and computing.  He will be joined in the coming months by a second Administrator/Developer, Martin Cook, who is also a graduate student in the Physics Department.  We are still awaiting the finalization of the funding flow from OSG/Wisconsin to Columbia to Wits, and while this is pending, the Wits group has been able to commission a small number of nodes acquired locally.  In late June, they succeeded in getting their first Grid test node on the net.

In late May, Dodd (Columbia) met with members of the DOSAR sub-group within OSG at a one-day meeting in Oklahoma.  Ben Clifford of OSG/EOT also attended the meeting, with the Wits group participating by phone, and with the participation by phone (briefly) of Ruth Pordes.  There is strong interest within the DOSAR group in providing remote assistance for the Wits group as they implement the OSG (they have experience performing a similar service with the OSG sites in Brazil).  It is foreseen that Clifford will visit the Wits group for perhaps two weeks later this year, to provide on-site support.

On the EOT side, we expect that the two students from Wits will attend the Nebraska OSG School in August.  They will also visit OSG participants in the Chicago and New York areas, to discuss OSG issues and work remotely on the OSG installation at Wits.  Alina Bejan and Mike Wilde of OSG/EOT are helping to coordinate these activities.
