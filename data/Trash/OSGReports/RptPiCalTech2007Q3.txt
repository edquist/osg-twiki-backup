LIGO lost its Integration Testbed and Validation Testbed site administrator near the end of the third quarter. A new job description was generated and circulated to the ITB/VTB area coordinator and executive team for review and feedback. It has now been entered into the Caltech job submission process and should be posted very soon.

During the months of July, August and September of 2007 LIGO can report following achievements involving application development for LIGO with emphasis on running LIGO workflows on the OSG:
   * I increased the number of OSG sites that LIGO can run applications on from 12 sites to  24 sites.
   * I attended the OSG-USERS meeting held at Fermilab on July 26/27 where I gave the ppt presentation: Running LIGO workflows on the OSG.
On August 23 LIGO achieved the OSG/LIGO September milestone of running at least 1000 LIGO jobs simultaneously on the OSG. The actual number achieved was 4577. Furthermore, LIGO generated and tested 10 LIGO workflow of different job size, data requirements and lengths on 10 different OSG sites for measuring wall time and disk space usage. 
Worked with the LIGO Binary Inspiral Analysis group to understand how to check out and install the latest version of the inspiral code used for LIGO's binary inspiral data analysis. 

Working with the LIGO/OSG Council Representative, identified Einstein@Home contacts in Germany that had successfully ported the Einstein@Home application to the German DGRID. Held a teleconference with these developers on September 28th to present on the job submission model for the OSG and to discuss how the Einstein@Home application runs on the German DGRID and how it might be ported to the OSG.
Worked with LIGO/OSG Integration Testbed Site Administrator to install and configure SQUID based on the ITB 0.7.0 release to begin exploring its applicability to the Einstein@Home work flow management on the OSG.

LIGO's ITB site administrator attended the OSG site administer meeting at July 30-31 to gain training and share experiences with other OSG site admins. LIGO ITB site administrator was assigned as one of the OSG 0.7.0 ITB coordinator to report and monitor the OSG 0.7.0 validation progress and responsible to communicate between VO users and site administers if VO validation application fail on the ITB sites.

VDT 1.8.1 is now installed and tested on "osg-vtb.ligo.caltech.edu" Validation Test Bed servers; OSG 0.7.1 release had been installed and tested on "osg-itb.ligo.caltech.edu" Integration Test Bed servers.

dCache is now installed and deployed on both VTB (osg-vtb.ligo.caltech.edu) and ITB (osg-itb.ligo.caltech.edu) servers. And dCache on ITB servers are under the LBL SRM Testers daily testing and monitoring.

Work on year two statements of work began in this quarter. Review by the OSG Resources Managers began towards the end of the quarter.

Resources managers working with the project associate reviewed the staffing architecture of the OSG and made recommendations to the OSG executive team. Some feedback with executive director at this time.

Began planning for the next OSG Finance Board meeting to be held at Fermilab on November 2.
