Key accomplishments:
Staff at UIUC played a key role in investigating and addressing various problems reported by VOs and Users.  Leading the troubleshooting team, we addressed numerous issues including: 
   * GLOW-CMS error on VORS (GOC ticket 3695): When GLOW-CMS site was failing a test on VORS for no apparent reasons, we debugged and traced the error to a bug in site_verify code that is triggered in the presence of AFS file system. We fixed the bug and released it as a patch for VDT. Documentation summarizing this problem is located at:
 https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Troubleshooting/GlowCmsVors. 
   * Launched the Campaign for 0.8.0 deployment, to help sites upgrade to 0.8.0. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Troubleshooting/CampaignSiteInstallation.
   * We helped to resolve problems experienced by LIGO running their workflows. These included tickets 3986, 4308, 4310, 4311. Ticket 3986 dealt with the problem that LIGO was experiencing running job at FIU production site, with Grid Monitor not getting updated information.  The solution included a patch to fork.pm and setting 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH', 'PERL5LIB' and 'PATH' variables were added to the child process environment. Details can be found on the twiki page: https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Troubleshooting/LigoJobFailuresAtFIUPG.
   * To address the requirement of having non-Glue attributes to be published by OSG Information Services (e.g. MPI related attributes), we came up with a solution that was eventually adopted. To implement this solution while maintaining interoperability with EGEE, we were involved in the development of a LDIF filter for the BDII aggregator. This solution proves to successful after ITB testing.
   * We provided bug fixes to GIP code for VDT 1.8.1 a and b. Responded to and helped resolve tickets 4302, 4314, 4223, 4163.

Concerns and Issues being Worked:
   * Because UIUC year 2 funding was not allocated yet from U. of Wisconsin during this period, the salary support for Anand Padmanabhan was provided through another funding source. This funding source will need to be reimbursed after UIUC OSG year 2 funding is in place.
