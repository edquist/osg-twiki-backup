Fermilab leads the OSG Security Team. We attended the weekly security meetings which plan and track the OSG security activities and the tasks in the security plan. We are working down the control and assessment tasks in the plan. The following tasks have been completed, including implementation of the associated assessment process:

   * 2.3.1.1 Roles and Responsibilities: OSG Org chart published and filled out.
   * 2.3.1.2 Awareness for OSG Managers: Awareness materials created, containing all necessary information.
   * 2.3.2.1 Computer Security Lifecycle Meeting: Meeting notes archived.
   * 2.3.2.2 Briefing of the Executive Board: Executive Board Meeting Minutes archived.
   * 2.3.2.3 Risk Assessment: Risk Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment written.
   * 2.4.1.2 Regular OSG Core Security Phone Conference: Minutes archived.
   * 2.4.1.4 Security Briefing at Consortium Meetings: Briefings and discussion material archived.

We are testing a security tracking and assessment tool at https://ste.opensciencegrid.org:443/ste/  
which will help automate the security control assessment process.

Fermilab developed and gave the Security Awareness training at the OSG All hands meeting in March. Some deliverables are delayed until the new OSG security hire is on board.
A job opening was posted for the full time OSG security professional. As of April 15th the job had been offered to and accepted by Mine Altunay. We do not have a start date yet. 

Work has progressed on the OSG-LIGO working group on identity management and authorization.  A WBS and Project Plan have been developed andwork is on target to finish by the summer.

There were no security incidents during this time period.
