At the end of Q1 &#8217;07, several potential projects had been identified for Greg Sharp to pursue at Cornell, since most of the milestones in the original SOW were satisfied in advance by reformulation of the billing data capture project as a GRATIA probe.  These projects were
   * local site aggregation of dCache billing information
   * Gratia probe to map from batch job id to DN&Role from the GRAM auditing system to allow accounting per person (requires some update to GRAM auditing first)
   * GridFTP transfer accounting
The second project involved issues within the GLOBUS source, and the GLOBUS developers themselves have addressed them.  In conjunction with these specific tasks, the Cornell group continues to test installation procedures for VDT and dCache.

While the GridFTP transfer accounting code existed, Greg Sharp identified the issues that prevented the accounting from functioning.  He reported his findings to the FNAL/dCache group and fixes were rapidly found and implemented.

Greg Sharp and the GRATIA developers reviewed the GRATIA modifications necessary for a local site aggregation probe at the beginning of Q2, and once the GRATIA modifications were complete, the probe itself implemented at the end of Q2. Upon incorporation of the original dCache billing probe submitted in Q1 into the official distribution, its functionality was re-verified.

Sharp has vetted the VDT 1.7.1 release installation, uncovering and reporting a number of installation bugs in the process.

In parallel, Sharp has been establishing an OSG VDT on a test farm at Cornell using Sun Grid Engine as the globus job manager.  He has resolved and reported a long standing bug in the VDT scripts with the use of SGE, as well as a bug in the VDT dcache installation scripts.  The VDT dCache installation process was problematic because of undocumented system configuration requirements that differed significantly from the standard configuration used at LEPP.  The problems encountered have been reported to Hesselroth.  

Greg Sharp and Dan Riley have been evaluating the scope of a suggested SRM project to recover disk space whose explicit lease has expired.
