---+ Effort Reports from Doug Olson
---++ April - June 2008

---+++ OSG RA

There were 598 personal certificates issued in Q2-08 with 320 being issued via the self service replacement interface. There were 1964 host/service certificates issued with the majority (1728) being issued via the gridadmin interface. As usual, some effort went towards user support issues with certificates and requests.

A tracking system used to monitor the status of certificate requests processed by OSG RA Agents was moved from some old hardware being decommisioned (www.ppdg.net) to a virtual host on some other producton hardware (roundup.doegrids.org).

At the TAGPMA meeting at the Oakland NERSC facility there was additional discussion of the OSG ID vetting procedures. It was agreed that the term "trusted agent" was the best descriptive term and the wording developed at the meeting was:
<blockquote>

 <font color="royalblue"><blockquote>

A person (a human end-entity (EE)) requests identity certification. An attestation by a trusted agent about the identity of this person to a registration authority (RA) is sufficient evidence to permit the RA to accept the certification request.
</blockquote><blockquote>
   * RA should document how the TA communicated the ID vetting attestation to the RA
   * How TA is identified
   * show integrity of id vetting to CSR submission
   * RA responsible for attestation
</blockquote></font>
</blockquote>

Some of these requirements will lead to some changes in the OSG methods and record keeping, primarily about how the Trusted Agent (or Sponsor) is identified.
---+++ Security Team Activities

Attended weekly security operations meeting and participated in policy, security planning and incident issues.

---+++ ISGC2008

I attended the International Symposium on Grid Computing in Taiwan (http://event.twgrid.org/isgc2008/) which was hosted by Academia Scinica Grid Computing. I gave three presentations on aspects of OSG as well as a poster. These materials are posted in the Doc DB ( 746, 747, 748, 749).

I also attended the !APGridPMA meeting held adjacent to the conference and presented the materials mentioned above about the ID vetting methods used by OSG.
---++ January-March 2008
---+++ OSG RA

There were 659 personal certificates issued in Q1-08 of which 376 were issued via the self service replacement interface. There were 1010 host/service certificates issued with the majority (661) being issued via the gridadmin interface. As usual, some effort went towards user support issues with certifcates and requests.

The results of the DOEGrids CA audit were presented by Mike Helm at the !EUGridPMA meeting in Amsterdam. A significant aspect of the discussion concerned the methods for identity vetting used by OSG, which are different from the face-to-face id vetting procedures used by most European CAs and defined in the IGTF Classic CA Profile. The presentation I made on the OSG ID vetting methods, which are based on the methods normally used for remote access to scientific computing resources in the U.S., is posted at http://www.eugridpma.org/agenda/archive-a073/olson-usid+osg-ra.pdf. The result of discussion at the meeting was that the methods used by OSGs are valid and we should work on the wording to describe them appropriately to be included in a future revision of the Classic CA profile.
---+++ Security Team Activities

Attended weekly meetings and participated in security plan, policy and incident issues that arose.
---++ October-December 2007
---+++ OSG RA
 There were 432 personal certificate issued and 1286 host/service certificates issued in this quarter by DOEGrids CA, the majority of which were via the OSG registration authority. There were 11 people authorized for gridadmin access to the CA, allowing automated host certificate issuance as well as four people who renewed their registration agent privilege.

I prepared registration materials including samples of registration agent logs for the internal audit of the DOEGrids CA which took place in December. I also prepared slides describing the OSG registration procedures as well as a tour of the RA web pages for the auditors on Dec. 3. The audit was part of the ongoing !EUGridPMA accreditation process.

---+++ Security Plan activities
 Over the course of this quarter we conducted an evaluation of the security controls for OSG as defined in the OSG Security Plan. For 2007, this was primarily a data collection and interview process to gather information from all the people responsible for the core services of OSG. The results of this are shown at Security.ControlsAssessment2007 which is a matrix of core services and the information gathered about the various security controls applicable to those services.

This was a learning experience for all involved and we expect changes and improvements in the process, and controls, for the 2008 cycle.

---+++ Policy activities
 I participated in the discussion of various policies during this period. A discussion about policies relating to what are called Robot certificates is expected to lead to this new type of certificate being available from DOEgrids in the future.

---++ July-September 2007
---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3 Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
 The OSG RA Agents processed 600 certificate requests in this period, 486 certificates were issued directly via the privileged interface for host/service certificates, and 100 personal certificates via the self-service replacement interface.

The DOEGrids CA is planning an internal audit to be performed in December 2007 with a report to be presented to the !EUGridPMA. In this period we had some initial planning and discussions of the participation of the OSG RA in this audit.

As a continuation of the planning for managing large numbers of host certificates started in the previous period, there were discussions about a process to issue certificates using the existing Grid Admin interface of the CA. An outline of this process and workflow diagram is shown at Security.BulkHostCertsNoPIN. Effort at BNL are considering developing scripts for this type of process which could be contributed to OSG for use at other sites.

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4 Deliver CA needs for LIGO
 The detailed deliverables for the LIGO adjustments to the DOEGrids CA were completed with the deployment of the DOEGrids CA running at upgraded version of the Redhat Certificate System (7.1) on July 5. In addition to some changes of the CA software and configuration, carried out by ESnet staff, there were some changes to the [[Security.CertScriptsPackage][certificate scripts]] package coordinated with the CA software update. A few follow-up items (handling of certificate renewal notifications) was handled following the software upgrade and were completed in September.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security
 Under the coordination of Mine Altunay we started the annual Test and Evaluation of the Security Controls defined in the OSG Cyber Security Plan, for the OSG Core services. In addition to providing information about the OSG RA core service, I assist Mine with the collection and evaluation of the results of this process. It is anticipated that this annual Test and Evaluation will be complete by December.

I contributed to the discussion and evaluation of the vulnerabilities and security incidents in this period. I prepared a summary of the OSG response to vulnerabilities that was included in the OSG Metrics Assessment for Year 1 (OSG Doc. 541), in September.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

I contributed to review and updates of the policy documents being developed for OSG and the JSPG. The status of these documents is maintained at Security.PolicyandProcedureTable.

---++ April-June 2007
---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3 Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
 In this period 600 certificate requests were processed by Agents of the OSG RA, another 1800 host and service certificates were issued using the pre-authorized !GridAdmin interface, and 160 personal certificates were renewed via the self-authenticated renewal interface.

We had some thinking and discussions with ESnet, and administrators from BNL and FNAL, Jay Packard and Tim Messer, on issues and ideas for managing large numbers of host certificates. There is a feature of the !RedHat Certificate System software (RHCS) to use PIN-based authentication for certificate requests. This could be used to reserve host certificate names for which a PIN could later be used, as part of a sites host management infrastructure, to get certificates for hosts at the time they are installed, booted, etc. There is still an issue that email notifications from the CA ought to be handled differently so that information is batched together and not sent for each individual certificate.

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4 Deliver CA needs for LIGO
 Work was completed on adjustments to the DOEGrids CA interfaces to better suit the needs of LIGO. This included changes in the script interfaces as well as email notification characteristics. The detailed description of the project is at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Security/OsgLigoIdAuthz. These adjustments coincided with a deployment of major upgrade to a new version of the RHCS software used for the DOEGrids CA on July 5.

The key feature adjusted for LIGO, and beneficial to all OSG participants, are changes to the email notifications taking into account requests made either with the web browser interface or a script interface. The other significant feature was the addition of a script for requesting host/service certificates using the !GridAdmin interface for which a single authentication can be used to generate multiple certificates. It was tested for requesting up to 1000 certificates at one time.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security

We held the weekly OSG security meetings regularly. There were two minor security vulnerabilities covered in this period. The following policy documents being developed by the Joint Security Policy Group were considered:
   * Grid Security Policy - a framework document for all detailed documents 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Registration Policy 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Operations Policy 
   * Grid Site Operations Policy 
   * Policy on Personal Logged Information 
   * Incident Response for Grid Hosts 

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies
 The policy documents mentioned above were discussed for input from OSG to the JSPG.

---++ January-March 2007

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3 Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
 Continue to oversee the RA functions and assist agents, authorize !GridAdmin requests, review certificate requests and handle the certificate requests which do not have an agent assigned to them.

One significant topic of the work is understanding and planning for how administrators can deal with host/service certificates for a large number of hosts. The present !GridAdmin interface is suitable for dealing with a handful of certificates but more is required to manage large numbers (> 100) certificates. This is an ongoing topic.

I attended (by video conference) the TAGPMA meeting where there was considerable discussion of the draft MICS (Membership Integrated Certificate Service) profile for CAs. This profile is for Certification Authorities that have a back-end integrated with some institutional authentication database and can grant certificates to people based on authentication with the institutional database. The draft profile was modified in ways that are consistent with the practices at a number of major computing facilities account practices in the U.S. This profile was approved by the TAGPMA. It will be reviewed by the other regional PMAs (!EUGridPMA and !APGridPMA). When and if it is accepted by all three regional PMAs it will become an IGTF profile which can then be used to accredit CAs that meet it's requirements.

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4 Deliver CA needs for LIGO

Igor Sfiligoi is coordinating the project to make modifications to the DOEGrids CA functionality to meet the requirements of LIGO as described at Security.OsgLigoIdAuthz. Part of my participation in that project is to make modifications to the existing cert-gridadmin script in order to allow multiple certificates to be generated within a single authentication to the CA.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security

I attend the weekly OSG security meeting and frequently chair it, pending the arrival of a new hire for Security Officer at FNAL.

As Deputy Security Officer there was one low risk security alert in March that I coordinated involving vulnerabilities in Tomcat and MySQL.

I attended the Middleware Security Working Group meeting at UCSD on March 1,2. Bob Cowles chaired the meeting. There was considerable discussion of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and GUMS and it became apparent that the usage model is different on OSG compared to EGEE. Current usage on EGEE is to treat the signed extension to the grid proxy as authoritative and to validate the signature much like trating the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server as a Certification Authority. On OSG the usage is to treat the extension in the proxy as a hint which gets validated by communications between the GUMS service and the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.

I contributed to the definition of the ST&E (Security Controls Test and Evaluation) procedures identified inthe OSG Security Plan.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

The main policy work was discussion of the Grid Site Operations Policy document being developed by the JSPG. This was discusses a few times in the weekly OSG security meetings as well as on the mail lists. A near final version was endorsed by the OSG security team and adoption by EGEE and OSG is expected in the near future.

---++ November/December 2006

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3 Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)

The RA business continues. Quite a few certificates issued and some new agents added. A discussion about SAM service certificates with the TAGPMA was useful and thought provoking.

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4 Deliver CA needs for LIGO

I had a followup conversation with Warren Anderson (in Sept.) to update the action items. He will let me know if something urgent comes up. DOEGrids is preparing to update the CA software to a current release of the RedHat CM. The old software had limited functionality so looking into the new software is the best strategy for adjusting the interface for LIGO.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security

Working on security plan.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies
