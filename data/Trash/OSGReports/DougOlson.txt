---+ Effort Reports from Doug Olson

---++ March 2007

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO

---+++ 1.1.3 Security

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

---++ November 2006

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)

The RA business continues. Quite a few certificates issued and some new agents added.
A discussion about SAM service certificates with the TAGPMA was useful and thought provoking.


---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO

I had a followup conversation with Warren Anderson (in Sept.) to update
the action items.  He will let me know if something urgent comes up.
DOEGrids is preparing to update the CA software to a current release
of the RedHat CM.   The old software had limited functionality so looking
into the new software is the best strategy for adjusting the interface for LIGO.
