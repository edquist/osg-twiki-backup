---+ Effort Reports from Doug Olson

---++ April-June 2007
---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
In this period 600 certificate requests were processed by Agents of the OSG RA,
another 1800 host and service certificates were issued using the pre-authorized !GridAdmin interface,
and 160 personal certificates were renewed via the self-authenticated renewal interface.
 

Discussions with BNL and FNAL on issues and needs for managing large numbers
of host certificates.
a125 1
Attended TAGPMA meetings by video.

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO
Completed development and deployment of modifications to the DOEGrids CA
functionality and interfaces according to LIGO requirements.
 
---+++ 1.1.3 Security
Held weekly security operations meetings.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies
Some JSPG policies advanced. Site Ops Policy, VO Security Policy. Other?

---++ January-March 2007

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
Continue to oversee the RA functions and assist agents, authorize !GridAdmin requests,
review certificate requests and handle the certificate requests which do not have
an agent assigned to them.

One significant topic of the work is understanding and planning for how
administrators can deal with host/service certificates for a large number of hosts.
The present !GridAdmin interface is suitable for dealing with a handful of certificates
but more is required to manage large numbers (> 100) certificates. This is an ongoing
topic.

I attended (by video conference) the TAGPMA meeting where there was considerable
discussion of the draft MICS (Membership Integrated Certificate Service) profile for CAs.
This profile is for Certification Authorities that have a back-end integrated with
some institutional authentication database and can grant certificates to people
based on authentication with the institutional database.
The draft profile was modified in ways that are consistent with the practices
at a number of major computing facilities account practices in the U.S.
This profile was approved by the TAGPMA.  It will be reviewed by the other
regional PMAs (!EUGridPMA and !APGridPMA).  When and if it is accepted by
all three regional PMAs it will become an IGTF profile which can then be used
to accredit CAs that meet it's requirements.


---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO

Igor Sfiligoi is coordinating the project to make modifications to the
DOEGrids CA functionality to meet the requirements of LIGO
as described at Security.OsgLigoIdAuthz.
Part of my participation in that project is to make modifications
to the existing cert-gridadmin script in order to allow multiple
certificates to be generated within a single authentication to the CA.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security

I attend the weekly OSG security meeting and frequently chair it,
pending the arrival of a new hire for Security Officer at FNAL.

As Deputy Security Officer there was one low risk security alert
in March that I coordinated involving vulnerabilities in Tomcat 
and MySQL.

I attended the Middleware Security Working Group meeting at UCSD
on March 1,2.  Bob Cowles chaired the meeting.  There was considerable
discussion of VOMS and GUMS and it became apparent that the usage
model is different on OSG compared to EGEE.  Current usage on EGEE
is to treat the signed extension to the grid proxy as authoritative
and to validate the signature much like trating the VOMS server as a
Certification Authority.  On OSG the usage is to treat the extension
in the proxy as a hint which gets validated by communications between
the GUMS service and the VOMS server.

I contributed to the definition of the ST&E (Security Controls Test and Evaluation)
procedures identified inthe OSG Security Plan.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

The main policy work was discussion of the Grid Site Operations Policy document
being developed by the JSPG.  This was discusses a few times in the weekly OSG security
meetings as well as on the mail lists.  A near final version was endorsed by
the OSG security team and adoption by EGEE and OSG is expected in the near future.

---++ November/December 2006

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)

The RA business continues. Quite a few certificates issued and some new agents added.
A discussion about SAM service certificates with the TAGPMA was useful and thought provoking.


---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO

I had a followup conversation with Warren Anderson (in Sept.) to update
the action items.  He will let me know if something urgent comes up.
DOEGrids is preparing to update the CA software to a current release
of the RedHat CM.   The old software had limited functionality so looking
into the new software is the best strategy for adjusting the interface for LIGO.
	
---+++ 1.1.3 Security

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

Working on the security plan.
