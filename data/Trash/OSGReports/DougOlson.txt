---+ Effort Reports from Doug Olson
---++ October-December 2007
---+++ OSG RA
---+++ Security Plan activities
---+++ Policy activities

---++ July-September 2007
---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
The OSG RA Agents processed 600 certificate requests in this period, 486 
certificates were issued directly via the privileged interface for host/service certificates,
and 100 personal certificates via the self-service replacement interface.

The DOEGrids CA is planning an internal audit to be performed in December 2007
with a report to be presented to the !EUGridPMA.
In this period we had some initial planning and discussions of the participation
of the OSG RA in this audit.

As a continuation of the planning for managing large numbers of
host certificates started in the previous period, there were discussions
about a process to issue certificates using the existing Grid Admin
interface of the CA.  An outline of this process and workflow
diagram is shown at Security.BulkHostCertsNoPIN.  Effort at BNL
are considering developing scripts for this type of process which
could be contributed to OSG for use at other sites.

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO
The detailed deliverables for the LIGO adjustments to the DOEGrids CA
were completed with the deployment of the DOEGrids CA running
at upgraded version of the Redhat Certificate System (7.1) on July 5.
In addition to some changes of the CA software and configuration,
carried out by ESnet staff, there were some changes to the [[Security.CertScriptsPackage][certificate scripts]]
package coordinated with the CA software update.
A few follow-up items (handling of certificate renewal notifications)
was handled following the software upgrade and were completed
in September.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security
Under the coordination of Mine Altunay we started the annual Test and Evaluation
of the Security Controls defined in the OSG Cyber Security Plan,
for the OSG Core services.  In addition to providing information about
the OSG RA core service, I assist Mine with the collection and evaluation
of the results of this process.  It is anticipated that this annual Test
and Evaluation will be complete by December.

I contributed to the discussion and evaluation of the vulnerabilities and
security incidents in this period.  I prepared a summary of the OSG response
to vulnerabilities that was included in the OSG Metrics Assessment for Year 1
(OSG Doc. 541), in September.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

I contributed to review and updates of the policy documents being developed
for OSG and the JSPG.  The status of these documents is maintained at
Security.PolicyandProcedureTable.


---++ April-June 2007
---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
In this period 600 certificate requests were processed by Agents of the OSG RA,
another 1800 host and service certificates were issued using the pre-authorized !GridAdmin interface,
and 160 personal certificates were renewed via the self-authenticated renewal interface.
 
We had some thinking and discussions with ESnet, and administrators from BNL and FNAL,
Jay Packard and Tim Messer, on issues and ideas for managing large numbers
of host certificates.  There is a feature of the !RedHat Certificate System software (RHCS)
to use PIN-based authentication for certificate requests.  This could be used
to reserve host certificate names for which a PIN could later be used,
as part of a sites host management infrastructure, to get certificates for hosts
at the time they are installed, booted, etc.  There is still an issue that email notifications
from the CA ought to be handled differently so that information is batched together
and not sent for each individual certificate.


---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO
Work was completed on adjustments to the DOEGrids CA interfaces
to better suit the needs of LIGO.  This included changes in the script interfaces
as well as email notification characteristics.  The detailed description of the
project is at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Security/OsgLigoIdAuthz.
These adjustments coincided with a deployment of major upgrade to a new version of
the RHCS software used for the DOEGrids CA
on July 5.

The key feature adjusted for LIGO, and beneficial to all OSG participants,
are changes to the email notifications taking into account requests made either
with the web browser interface or a script interface.  The other significant
feature was the addition of a script for requesting host/service certificates
using the !GridAdmin interface for which a single authentication can be used to
generate multiple certificates. It was tested for requesting up to 1000
certificates at one time.
 
---+++ 1.1.3 Security

We held the weekly OSG security meetings regularly.  There were two minor security vulnerabilities
covered in this period.  The following policy documents being developed by the Joint Security Policy Group
were considered:
   * Grid Security Policy - a framework document for all detailed documents
   * VO Registration Policy
   * VO Operations Policy
   * Grid Site Operations Policy
   * Policy on Personal Logged Information
   * Incident Response for Grid Hosts

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies
The policy documents mentioned above were discussed for input from OSG to the JSPG.

---++ January-March 2007

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)
Continue to oversee the RA functions and assist agents, authorize !GridAdmin requests,
review certificate requests and handle the certificate requests which do not have
an agent assigned to them.

One significant topic of the work is understanding and planning for how
administrators can deal with host/service certificates for a large number of hosts.
The present !GridAdmin interface is suitable for dealing with a handful of certificates
but more is required to manage large numbers (> 100) certificates. This is an ongoing
topic.

I attended (by video conference) the TAGPMA meeting where there was considerable
discussion of the draft MICS (Membership Integrated Certificate Service) profile for CAs.
This profile is for Certification Authorities that have a back-end integrated with
some institutional authentication database and can grant certificates to people
based on authentication with the institutional database.
The draft profile was modified in ways that are consistent with the practices
at a number of major computing facilities account practices in the U.S.
This profile was approved by the TAGPMA.  It will be reviewed by the other
regional PMAs (!EUGridPMA and !APGridPMA).  When and if it is accepted by
all three regional PMAs it will become an IGTF profile which can then be used
to accredit CAs that meet it's requirements.


---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO

Igor Sfiligoi is coordinating the project to make modifications to the
DOEGrids CA functionality to meet the requirements of LIGO
as described at Security.OsgLigoIdAuthz.
Part of my participation in that project is to make modifications
to the existing cert-gridadmin script in order to allow multiple
certificates to be generated within a single authentication to the CA.

---+++ 1.1.3 Security

I attend the weekly OSG security meeting and frequently chair it,
pending the arrival of a new hire for Security Officer at FNAL.

As Deputy Security Officer there was one low risk security alert
in March that I coordinated involving vulnerabilities in Tomcat 
and MySQL.

I attended the Middleware Security Working Group meeting at UCSD
on March 1,2.  Bob Cowles chaired the meeting.  There was considerable
discussion of VOMS and GUMS and it became apparent that the usage
model is different on OSG compared to EGEE.  Current usage on EGEE
is to treat the signed extension to the grid proxy as authoritative
and to validate the signature much like trating the VOMS server as a
Certification Authority.  On OSG the usage is to treat the extension
in the proxy as a hint which gets validated by communications between
the GUMS service and the VOMS server.

I contributed to the definition of the ST&E (Security Controls Test and Evaluation)
procedures identified inthe OSG Security Plan.

---+++ 1.1.3.4 Write Security Policies

The main policy work was discussion of the Grid Site Operations Policy document
being developed by the JSPG.  This was discusses a few times in the weekly OSG security
meetings as well as on the mail lists.  A near final version was endorsed by
the OSG security team and adoption by EGEE and OSG is expected in the near future.

---++ November/December 2006

---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.3  Collaborate with the ESNET DOE Grids (OSG RA)

The RA business continues. Quite a few certificates issued and some new agents added.
A discussion about SAM service certificates with the TAGPMA was useful and thought provoking.


---+++ 1.1.2.1.1.4  Deliver CA needs for LIGO

I had a followup conversation with Warren Anderson (in Sept.) to update
the action items.  He will let me know if something urgent comes up.
DOEGrids is preparing to update the CA software to a current release
of the RedHat CM.   The old software had limited functionality so looking
into the new software is the best strategy for adjusting the interface for LIGO.
