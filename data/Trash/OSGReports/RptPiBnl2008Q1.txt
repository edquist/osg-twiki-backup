---+!! 2008Q1 PI Quarterly Report

<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

In the first quarter of 2008, the activities of the OSG group at BNL were focused on the following areas
   * introducing security features into the pilot-based job submission mechanism
      * in consultations between FNAL, BNL and EGEE, introduced a common VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS annotation "role=pilot" which allows for creation of accounts with limited privileges, which are to be used specifically for pilot job submission on grid sites. This eliminates the previous need to use production accounts for this purpose (see the next item on glexec integration), improving the overall security situation.
      * worked out configuration details of GUMS service, which allow us to properly use the privileged executable "glexec" in setuid mode, thus bringing the Panda pilot job submission mechanism in alignment with OSG and EGEE security policies - while pilot jobs are started from "generic" accounts, the actual payload is run, and is attributed to, a specific user with proper credentials
      * integrated the glexec security mechanism described above with MyProxy credential caching service, while working out configuration details
      * implemented automated renewal of expiring proxies
      * based on the activity detiled above, within the next quarter, we anticipate full readiness of Panda software for glexec/MyProxy mode of payload execution, on all sites (including EGEE) that support such functonality
   * improving reliability and throughput of Panda Workload Management System
      * continued migration to the non ATLAS specific AutoPilot system used for pilot job submission
      * started a new effort to assess scalability features of Panda and perform more rigorous stress testing
      * leveraging ATLAS activities in Panda development and support (including service infrastructure improvements, packaging and versioning of the code), for the Panda component of the OSG Workload Management effort
      * leveraging ATLAS optimization of queries and organization of the Panda database, including schema extensions for improved support of other VOs
   * schedd glide-in based Pilot Factory
      * made improvements to the Pilot Factory code (glidein mechanism for automated pilot submission) and readied it for validation in full production environment
   * introducing VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo management features into the Panda server (work in progress)
      * based on work previously done by ATLAS, introduced the capability to connect to, and cache information from, the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server, based on which users' affiliation with VOs is continuously checked for improved security
      * started work on a comprehensive system of site resource allocation to VOs
