<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

In the first quarter of 2008, the activities of the OSG group at BNL were focused on the following areas
   * improving reliability and throughput of Panda Workload Management System instance at BNL (working with RACF staff)
      * deployed Panda on a new set of servers, with round robin mechanism currently used for load sharing
      * started work on adding a "smart switch" which will prevent redirection of service requests to non-functional or overloaded instances, thus improving access and realiability
      * continued migration to the AutoPilot system used for pilot job submission
      * started a new effort to assess scalability features of Panda and perform more rigorous stress testing
      * continued optimization of queries and organization of the Panda database
   * commissioned the CERN instance of Panda service into production
      * improving Panda interface with Bamboo: the job management system used by the Atlas VO
      * continued improvements in the pilot job code used by the Atlas VO, such as job recovery, better error reporting and others
   * started a joint effort between CERN and BNL aimed at better factoring, versioning and packaging of the Panda server code
   * introducing security features into the pilot-based job submission mechanism
      * in consultations between FNAL, BNL and EGEE, introduced a common VOMS annotation "role=pilot" which allows for creation of accounts with limited priviledges, which are to be used specifically for pilot job submission on grid sites. This eliminates the previous need to use production accounts for this purpose (see the next item on glexec integration), improving the overall security situation.
      * worked out configuration details of GUMS service, which allow us to properly use the priviledged executable "glexec" in setuid mode, thus bringing the Panda pilot job submission mechanism in alignment with OSG and EGEE security policies - while pilot jobs are started from "generic" accounts, the actual payload is run, and is attributed to, a specific user with proper credentials
      * integrated the glexec security mechanism described above with MyProxy credential caching service, while working out configuration details
      * implemented automated renewal of expiring proxies
   * introducing VO management features into the Panda server (work in progress)
      * introducing the capability to connect to, and cache information from, the VOMS server, based on which users' affiliation with VOs is continuously checked for improved security
      * started work on a compehensive system of site resource allocation to VOs
