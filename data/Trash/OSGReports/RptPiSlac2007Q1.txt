January:

 
EUgrid PMA meeting: The EUgrid PMA met for 3 days in Abingdon, UK. In addition to reviewing the new memberships requests from a number of new Certification Authorities, there was an extensive review of the Member Integrated Certification System (MICS) profile and hopefully the results will be approved by the other PMAs at their next meetings.  Other contentious issues were raised and discussed like the meaning of host/service certificates and what did they really mean and who was responsible for them; and what is the requirement for a face-to-face meeting. Also of interest were the Thawte WebofTrust signing and the PGP signing that I participated in.

Cyber Security R&D Workshop: Four research directions were selected as priorities for requesting funding. Of particular interest and where I participated most heavily was in authentication and attribute-based authorization.
