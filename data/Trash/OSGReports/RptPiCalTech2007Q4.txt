Application Support and Workflow Extensions:

   * Working with the Users Group and the Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed, used the LIGO Binary Inspiral Workflow application to validate the pre-release (0.7) of the OSG software stack prior to sign-off for the OSG 0.8.0 release. Validation went well at most sites, requiring minor tuning on occasion. However at the University of Chicago a particularly difficult issue occurred. Worked with the site administrator, the troubleshooting team and the user group to attempt to track this issue down. This reached the point where the OSG 0.8.0 release was being held up so agreed with representatives associated with this issue to go ahead and sign-off on the pre-release expecting this to be a minor issue on once 0.8.0 was out on the production grid.
   * Continued working issues associated with running the LIGO Binary Inspiral Workflow on the new release (0.8.0) of the OSG software stack. There is a similarity with issues seen at the University of Chicago Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed site prior to the release. While on the ITB this issue was never tracked down and was thought to be isolated to the University of Chicago site only as testing at all other sited did not show this issue. It now appears as thought the issue has greater extent than expected during the ITB testing. Will continue to evaluate this into the next quarter.
   * Began development and porting of Einstein@Home application to the OSG based on successful results with this port by a group at AEI that was able to port to the German D-Grid. The application uses significantly less data relative to the computational load making it more idea as a LIGO application for the OSG environment. It is also part of LIGO's periodic analysis, which greatly exceeds LIGO's computing capacity on the LIGO Data Grid. It is based on the "BOINC" framework, allowing it to be used spare cycles on computers around the world, much like SETI@Home. The application requires outgoing access for the worker nodes (or SQUID for URL proxies). As developed for D-Grid, it also uses WS-GRAM. The NAT routing for the worker nodes and the WS-Gram are not widely available on the OSG at this time but expected to be more widely available in the future. Early testing on a limited number of sites AND focusing on the OSG site at University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee have been very positive.
   * Attended and presented experiences running the LIGO Binary Inspiral Workflow on the OSG at a LIGO Scientific Collaboration workshop on the running of binary inspiral workflows and development. The workshop was very hands-on and generated interest from several post-docs and graduate students to using the OSG.

Trash/Trash/Integration and Validation Testbed support:

   * Still looking for a replacement to fill the opening at Caltech for this activity. Several applicants have applied to the job posting but haven't seen a qualified resume in this quarter. Expect this situation will improve after the holidays.

Resource Management:

   * Successfully completed the year two milestone in the WBS to have at least 75% of the year two Statements of Work (SOW) completed beyond the Resource Manager sign-off by November 15th.
   * Organized a Finance Board Meeting at Fermilab to discuss progress on the year two SOW, work plan, WBS and to prepare for the  upcoming Joint DOE/NSF external review of the OSG. Wrote a report of the Finance Board Meeting for distribution to the OSG Executive Board, OSG Council and as supporting materials for the external review.
   * Drafted a procedure for optimally managing use of shared resources on the OSG production grid with the goal of having the greatest scientific benefit to the OSG user community and stakeholders.
