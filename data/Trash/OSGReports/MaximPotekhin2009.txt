---++ January 2009
   * Engagement:
      * letters discussing the potential for collaboration sent to multiple organizations including:
         * Vice President for research of Columbia U, Vice President for research of SUNY Stony Brook, Vice Chancellor for Research at CUNY
         * Provost for Research of NYU (got a reply that they don't need us now but will keep in mind) 
         * two research groups at the BNL Biology Department and a research group at CFNM (Nanomaterials) - a number of different projects
      * received a reply from NYSGRID, to a letter sent a month earlier (telling us to wait)
