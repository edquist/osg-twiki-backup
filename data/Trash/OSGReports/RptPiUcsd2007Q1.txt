   * Hiring situation:<br>
      UCSD has successfully hired one of the two staff members for OSG. To make
      up for the lack of a second person, we are training a couple graduate students to help
      with the deliverables. This has delayed some of our milestones mentioned below.
   * UCSD milestones since OSG inception:
      * 12/15/06 Validate SRM/dCache prototype deployment candidate. DONE.
      * 12/15/06 Specify transfer metrics for viewing on the first OSG transfer aggregation prototype. DONE.
      * 2/1/07 Sustained operations of LIGO workflow at UCSD at the level of 25 jobs for one week. DONE.
      * 3/1/07 User documentation for OSG 0.6. DONE.
      * 3/1/07 Report by &#8220;CE Overload Task Force&#8221;. DELAYED.
      * 3/1/07 Client tools for site testing of OSG 0.6 site. DROPPED.
      * 3/8/07 Host the OSG Consortium All Hands Meeting. DONE.
      * 4/1/07 Document performance baseline for OSG data transfer. DELAYED
   * Work performed that is not explicitly spelled out in form of milestones in the UCSD SOW.
      * There are a number of milestones spelled out in the WBS with regard to "User Group Coordination",
         and the applications area in general. In practice, Rana (UCSD) and Green (FNAL) end up doing all the work 
         related with these milestones at this point.  It appears as if the effort required here might exceed the effort
         available. Meeting the milestones in the User Group and Applications area is thus under some strain.
