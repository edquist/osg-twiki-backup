---++ Period: January 2007
   * GUMS 1.2 is feature complete, and is now being tested/polished. New features are:
      * Client-side SSL security for encrypted connection to site LDAP server. 
      * Concise system status page. Provides a diagnostic summary of current configuration to give administrators an overview of their site mapping policies. 
      * Configuration Management:
         * Create/edit all configuration parameters from GUI. Manual editting of gums.config no longer necessary.  
         * Create timestamped backup of configuation file. 
         * Create manual user mappings from GUI. 
         * Reveal reverse mapping(s) for individual UNIX account. 
      * GUI/CLI reconciliation. Nearly all functions available on the web application are also available from the command line client, and vice versa.
   * A fair amount of internal refactoring to allow the dynamic configuration process to be more intuitive. 
   * Added in more fine-grained access permissions. We now have the notion of read-only access-- previously it was only read-write or none.  
   * Altered the gums.config format to be more clear even to administrators who may edit the file by hand.  
   * Created a XML schema for the gums.config file to allow more thorough validation.
   * Developed XSLT transform to convert old gums.config format to new one.   
   * Greatly refactored the approach to developing the GUMS system:
      * Converted GUMS over to version 2.0 of the Maven build system. 
      * Shifted GUMS development platform over to JPackage-provided tomcat, maven, java, etc., rather than using a VDT  install of the previous version of GUMS. See  http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Projects/GridDevHowTo
      * GUMS can now be run on Tomcat standalone, without an Apache front-end. 
      * We created a JPackage-compatible EGEE Trustmanager RPM (available from the GUMS page above). 
   * Planning for GUMS 1.2 release to VDT for integration soon.

---++ Period: December 2006
   * Ongoing supervision and collaboration with Jay Packard, who is implementing features for GUMS 1.2

---++ Period: November 2006
   * Visited Fermilab, with Jay Packard, for coordination meeting with Gabriele Garzolio and the Privilege Project group. 
   * Identified GUMS development roadmap consistent with OSG goals.
