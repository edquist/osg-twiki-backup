The nascent cluster at Wits was upgraded with a small number of dedicated cores during this period, and the head node configured with the OSG stack.  The Wits group hopes to use combined funds from Year 1 and Year 2 OSG funding to procure additional cluster nodes in the very near future.  The detailed specifications and vendor quotes are in hand, but the procurement is currently on hold while the personnel change at Wits (see below) is in transition.  Also during this period, as a result of Wits' outsourcing of its intra-campus internet management, internet access was disrupted for a period of several weeks.  Connectivity is now restored, and the Wits group has been able to re-confirm that job submission from remote OSG sites is possible.  We expect increasingly reliable cluster operation in the coming quarter, with increasing capacity as the new compute nodes are integrated into the cluster.

The Wits group has developed utilization metrics for the cluster, which have been described in detail in communications to the EOT Coordinator.  Ganglia is running on the cluster for the initial monitoring.

In terms of local applications being prepared to run on the cluster, these include three distinct BioInformatics projects and a mineral PET project.  It is foreseen that future applications will include genomics in local health and disease projects as well as particle physics AdS/CFT work.

A major activity for this year is the hosting of an OSG Grid School at Wits in late July.  The schedule and approximate agenda for this three-day School have been finalized, and the School is open for student registration.  Up to 40 student participants are expected, in addition to local and regional researchers.  The School will be led by both US and local scientists.  Funding commitments are in place from a number of sources, and we are working to secure commitments to cover remaining costs.

The Wits PI (Simon Connell) has left Wits, and we are currently in discussion as to how best to organize the ongoing Wits cluster activities with minimal disruption.  Connell intends to continue his work with OSG and the South African cluster once he is established in a new position.  The rest of the Wits group (faculty member Hazelhurst, staff scientist Ballestrero, and system administrators/developers Cook and Ives) are continuing their OSG work during this transition.
