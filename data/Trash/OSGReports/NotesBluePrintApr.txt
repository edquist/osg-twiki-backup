---+++ Difference between OSG and Engage VOs? 
 
Engage VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is a template for new communities who we are supporting as they learn to use the OSG and adapt their applications and systems for production use of the infrastructure.

OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is for individuals, small groups, OSG Staff and is managed by the OSG itself. Policies and agreements for this VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo are used to determine who can join, the length of time they are enabled to use the OSG.

---+++ Goals
   * Make it easier and more dynamic to instantiate VOs
   * Have a clearer understanding of the roles of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-groups - our intent is that they may be treated equivalently to VOs in a recursive fashion (see the Blueprint). VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-groups can inherit the properties of their parent VO. Where do we define whether to support a new user/user group as a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-Group  or a VO. 

---+++ How does a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo know it can run at a site?
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in GUMS template
   * Users names mapped to actually exist
   * GUMS pulls from the relevant VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Namespace in its entirety and implements a map 
   * Some sort of home directory exists for each mapped username on each GRAM and GridFTP host
   * site advertises support for the VO (via GIP-CEMON-VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS?)
   * the CA's the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo uses are trusted on the site.

---+++ Tests a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo a User can do to check a site accepts them?
   * globus-run -a -r
   * global-job-run osgtest? $OSG_GRID/?
   * globus-url-copy myfile <-> $OSG_APP/mydir/
  
---+++ TestSite: 
   * Get list of sites from VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS
   * for each site run TestSite

---+++ PPT -- how OSG works today.

Goal: Deliver document what the state of the art is for PPT on OSG today. Goal to identify holes and inconsistencies. The document should be precise and end-to-end. Discussion and details should be in Appendices. This document will be presented and discussed at the Blueprint meeting on 7th June. Following the review and acceptance of this deliverable we will start discussing future needs and roadmap.

Responsible: Gabriele; 

Scope:
   * Review of global VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo namespace. VOs, groups, roles - John Hover
   * Review of access enforcement and control by the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo as a user organization and by the resources providers - John Weigand
   * Review of Security auditing and accounting of VOs, groups, roles and their use - Steve Timm
   * Review of policy definition and policy enforcement capabilities, including VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and site level, and in the OSG "just in time" WMS systems.
