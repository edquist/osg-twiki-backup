*ITB/VTB activities*

This work is carried out by Jeff Porter.
An initial VTB cluster was deployed at NERSC using VMWare technology.
The SGE batch system was deployed on this cluster.  The VTB:ce from
VDT-1.6.1 was installed and work carried out in participation with
the VTB program.

Another permanent VTB cluster of 4 physical machines is being
prepared and is ready for installation of the OSG software.

The VTB work in preparation for the OSG 0.6.0 release uncovered a bug
in the installation for SGE and this was fixed prior to the release.

The main ITB work is testing of WS-GRAM.  An installation is maintained
for others to test against. Scaling tests of WS-GRAM were carried out and results
presented to the ITB group.

*SRM Tester activities*

This work is carried out by Alex Sim.
Enhancements were made to SRM-Tester for SRM V2.2.  Sites being tested
three times a day include
   * SRM/CASTOR (CERN)
   * SRM/dCache (FNAL)
   * SRM/DPM (CERN)
   * SRM/StoRM (INFN)
   * SRM/BeSRM (LBNL)
Results are available at http://datagrid.lbl.gov/

There were also enhancements to SRM-Tester for scalability measurements
and publication of results for SRM V1.1 implementations.

*OSG RA and Security activities*

This work is carried out by Doug Olson.
Continue to oversee the RA functions and assist agents, authorize !GridAdmin requests, review certificate requests and handle the certificate requests which do not have an agent assigned to them.
The limited ability for administrators to manage large numbers of host certificates (> 100) is an issue
that is currently being worked on.  Related to this issue, there has been work on modifications to the
script used to generated host/service certificates vai the !GridAdmin interface so that multiple
certificates can be generated from a single authentication with the CA.  This is part of the LIGO-OSG CA effort.

I attended (by video conference) the TAGPMA meeting where there was considerable discussion of the draft MICS (Membership Integrated Certificate Service) profile for CAs. This profile is for Certification Authorities that have a back-end integrated with some institutional authentication database and can grant certificates to people based on authentication with the institutional database.
This type of CA is important to the long term growth of OSG (and grid) since the current OSG registration procedures
do not scale up to very large numbers of grid users.


I attend and frequently chair the weekly OSG security meeting.
There has been progress implmenting the controls of the OSG security plan.
One minor security alert was issued in March and included a software update
to VDT for Tomcat and !MySQL.
The Grid Site Operations Policy document from the JSPG has been
discussed through several modifications and recently endorsed
by the OSG security group.  It should be adopted by OSG and EGEE in the near future.
