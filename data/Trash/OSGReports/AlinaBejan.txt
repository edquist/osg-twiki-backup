Weekly Status report
-----------------------

Week Oct 23-28, 2007
   * met w/ John McGee -- planned to work on study cases (Rosetta primarily, possiby other 2-3) 


Week Oct 15-20, 2007

  To Do:
   * finalize materials for SC mini tutorial -- synchronize with Ben for lecture (and lab) -- in progress
   * finalize lecture notes for FIGS08 as well -- almost done
   * work with Forrest (new CI employee) to get him familiarized with EOT assignments

Other action items (for most of these items I am waiting on Mike's input):

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) UTB response (follow-on)

2) Education:

a) [CDI Program Announcecment] http://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/cdi/

Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation (CDI) is NSF's bold five-year initiative to create revolutionary science and engineering research outcomes made possible by innovations and advances in computational thinking. Computational thinking is defined comprehensively to encompass computational concepts, methods, models, algorithms, and tools. Applied in challenging science and engineering research and education contexts, computational thinking promises a profound impact on the Nation's ability to generate and apply new knowledge. Collectively, CDI research outcomes are expected to produce paradigm shifts in our understanding of a wide range of science and engineering phenomena and socio-technical innovations that create new wealth
and enhance the national quality of life.

b) cloud computing

The two companies are investing to build large data centers that
students can tap into over the Internet to program and research
remotely, which is called ?cloud computing.? -- Google and IBM effort

3) Cristy -- gender-aware issue

"I'm putting together a gender-aware issue of iSGTW that will profile a
couple of women involved in grids with the lead story (hopefully) covering
EGEE's "shadowing day", which involves bringing schoolgirls in to "shadow"
female IT workers over their workday.

Does OSG have something similar (gender or equal opportunity type
policies/actions etc) that we could include in the article? Who do you
recommend I talk to to get an idea of gender balance/relations at OSG?" 

--> Do we (OSG) have anything like this ? As far as I know, there is no such activity.
So I wanted to check with you before responding

4) send out FIGS announce -- mailing lists -- which shall I use ? ( I forgot which osg lists I should use .... osg-all ? ) Then outreach@globus, and I could ask Cristy to post an announcement in one of the upcoming newsletters as well. And send some personal ones as well.

5) SC extra hour (Scott) -- we have agreed to add an 1.5h to Tue section (lab)

6) Signed email

7) Renci conference Microsoft eScience Workshop at RENCI -- Oct 21-23 -- that I will be attending (leaving Friday)
The Friday Center for Continuing Education
Plans to meet with: John McGee, Jen Schopf, attend Ian's panel, visit (maybe) with Duke's Material Sciences' division (future projects?)

8) Parallel programs:
- transform parallel programs into programs that run on the grid (Swift workflows ? MPI ?) --> incorporate into our lab manual
- in our tutorial we don't mention Parallel Computing -- is grid computing possible without parallel computing ? Shall we teach them Parallel Programming too ?
- correct to assume: any parallelisable problem is grid-appropriate ?
- I plan to take the exercises from Ian's "Designing and building Parallel Programs" book, and implement them on the grid (using Swift perhaps)

9) First complete set of slides ready for SC07 http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/~abejan/SC07.ppt
Also we have an URL for the lab http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/osgedu/schools/2007/sc07/intro-sunday/ , but we need to prune. 

10) Pan-Am proposal 

11) OISE facts -- current or not ?
