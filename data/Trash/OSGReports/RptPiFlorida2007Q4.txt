OSG-EOT Activities Report University of Florida

The following presents the monthly activities carried out at the University Of Florida towards OSG Education outreach and training for the period from October 1 to December 31, 2007.

October 2007

In Q3 2007, a course of action to get a compute element installed on a virtual machine was decided upon. Siddhartha Eluppai  Srivatsan, under the supervision of Craig Prescott began work in this direction. There were two major tasks that were completed by the end of October. The first one was to install the User Mode Linux virtual machine and connect it to the internet. The second major task was to setup DNS on the virtual machines.

November 2007

These activities can be divided into two parts. The first week was spent installing and configuring NFS for the virtual machine cluster. The next three weeks were spent installing and configuring Pacman in one of the directories of the shared file system. Then condor was installed using RPMs on the virtual machine. The virtual machine needed some extra packages that needed to be installed. This was duly taken note of by Siddhartha.

December 2007

Updating old documents was the first activity. This was necessary because before a new production version of OSG had been released, and hence before proceeding with the CE install on the virtual machines, it was necessary to verify the correct set of commands. A GUMS install was also performed as it would also become a part of this tutorial. In the second week of December Siddhartha had exams, after which he was on vacation to visit his family in India.

Notes:

1. Siddhartha Eluppai Srivatsan is directly supervised by Dr Craig Prescott (UF HPC Center) in carrying out this work and also reports to Paul Avery.

2. Siddhartha is currently working as a 0.5 FTE student graduate research assistant.
