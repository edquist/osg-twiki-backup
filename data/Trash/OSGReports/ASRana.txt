---++ February-July 2007
(To be completed soon).

---++ January 2007
   * Started collaborating on dCache's Gratia-based accounting effort, in context of OSG 'transfer aggregation'. Multiple sub-versions of dCache Gratia probe (being developed by Greg at Cornell) deployed and evaluated at UCSD. UCSD's production SRM/dCache is publishing transfer metrics to the OSG-ITB Gratia server.
   * Work-in-progress on converging previous effort on Edge Services Framework (ESF) Activity, in preparation of a v1 release in Feb'07.
   * Work-in-progress on User Group effort. Analysis of SRM and GridFTP clients at OSG sites to be performed, and feedback to be sent to individual sites that fail. 
   * Continued collaboration with LIGO team at Caltech and Pegasus team at ISI/USC, towards facilitating LIGO's usage of OSG.

---++ December 2006
   * Started collaborating on Storage VDT. Worked with Fermilab VDT team to extensively evaluate the features required in VDT, alongwith mutiple rapid deployments of sub-versions and providing feedback. Based on our experience with large-scale operation of SRM/dCache, proposed new features that would work towards upgrade of an existing complex deployment (as contrasted with a simple fresh deployment). Validated the SRM/dCache prototype deployment candidate.
   * Major upgrade of UCSD SRM/dCache (to v1.7). Effort augmented with improving VDT based deployment of dCache. Provided related feedback and guidance to CMS sites in US and Brazil.
   * Continued collaboration with LIGO team at Caltech and Pegasus team at ISI/USC, towards facilitating LIGO's usage of OSG.

---++ November 2006
   * Started collaborating with LIGO team at Caltech and Pegasus team at ISI/USC, towards facilitating LIGO's usage of OSG. Both teams introduced to using SRM/dCache SE at UCSD, with data movement over WAN (user's client at Caltech or USC) as well as within LAN (user's client on UCSD's CE cluster). 
   * Worked with Neha and Keith at Fermilab to discuss previous work done in OSG (with UCSD as an archetype OSG site) in context of GIN (OGF/GGF's Grid Interoperability Now) Community Group. Main GIN activities at resource-interoperation level that OSG participates in, are SRM interoperability exercises within GIN-Data, and job submission exercises within GIN-Ops. Other activities, viz. GIN-Auth and GIN-bdii, focus at resource-specification level. This plays an important role in establishing global-scale interoperability of OSG with other national and international Grid efforts. As part of GIN-Data, we had furnished a dCache SRM v1.1 interface. (We did not participate in GridFTP testing, since stand-alone GridFTP testing in GIN-Data was performed on globus implementations only). Since UCSD&#8217;s site is SRM-protocol based and has multiple GridFTP (dCache-specific implementation of GridFTP v1 protocol) servers underneath, we decided participating in stand-alone GridFTP exercise was not of practical utility. In fact, the SRM interoperability transfers had a Globus GridFTP server at a few peer Grids. Thus, it was also established that the dCache GridFTP implementation is interoperable with the Globus implementation. As part of GIN-Ops, we had furnished a set of GRAM/GridFTP interfaces and underlying compute resources to the GIN compute grid testbed. There were jobs submitted using clients from various grids to the UCSD site; execution of these jobs underwent proper authorization and completed successfully. Besides, we had held extensive meetings with the PRAGMA team, and with TDDFT (Time Dependent Domain Function Theory) group of National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. This led to a productive exchange of thoughts on how to successfully run PRAGMA's main application TDDFT after customization for OSG compute model. This exercise has not concluded yet, and depends on proper repackaging of TDDFT distribution and a few changes in PRAGMA job submission workflow.
   * Joined OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in preparation for User Group effort.
   * Based on experience gained from successful sustained performance of UCSD SRM/dCache in the ongoing CSA'06 data challenge exercise of CMS, provided feedback to dCache teams on improving future releases.
