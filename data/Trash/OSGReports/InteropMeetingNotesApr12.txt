---+ Meeting on Interoperability, April 12, 2007

---++ Introduction
   * Ruth, Rob Q, Rob G, Michael Ernst, John Hover, Xin, Burt

---++ Interoperability history
Ruth is giving a historical context on interoperabilty work in OSG, specifically with EGEE.   There was a group devoted entirely to this last year - since then it has been the assumption that it would be integrated into all OSG activities, implicitly.

---++ Serial notes about site availability monitoring
   * Site availability monitoring - there has been an effort for this at BNL.  There are WLCG expectations that this continue.
   * Can OSG provide the equivalent to the OSG SAM test.
   * Rob Q reports that work towards this has begun, but the question is how is this linked into the WLCG SA framework.
   * Rob Q thinks that if we have a standardized output from the probes, it could be consumed by the SAM group.  There is a project plan in doc DB.  Question is it comprehensive enough.
   * Burt notes that from CMS there is a subset of the SAM testing probes at CMS Tier2 sites, running under the CMS VO.
   * There are questions as to how this is integrated w/ EGEE's SAM services.
   * What is the schedule? Initial tests are supposed to be available June 1.
   * When do things get to SAM?  It is in the plan, as well as integration with ATLAS and CMS.
   * Should communicate the plans to WLCG.
   * Probes can be made to be Nagios compatible.

---++ Job priorities and publishing
   * John: is the attribute ETA being published correctly?  See https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/GIPAttributes

---++ Interoperability as part of release process
   * Testing effort to come from CMS, Burt, and it must cover the baseline services for LCG.
   * ATLAS is also prepared to put in effort to this.
   * Stefano Belforte is the contact on the EGEE side.
   * Ruth will write up a plan and send it to management.
