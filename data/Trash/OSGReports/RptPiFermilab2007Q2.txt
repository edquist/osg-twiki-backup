Fermilab Q2 2007 Quarterly Report
Ruth Pordes, V1.1

*Security*
     
The following security alerts were handled by the team in Q2:
   * Globus Security Advisory 2007-03: Nexus vulnerability
   * Globus Security Advisory 2007-02: GSI-OpenSSH vulnerability
   * dCache configuration
   * Condor configuration
   * Vulnerability in WS-Gram.

Only 2 of these alerts required software patches.

The full time OSG security professional, Mine Altunay, will start on July 2. We established the process whereby the Deputy Security Officer takes over when the Security Officer is not available. Work progressed, in collaboration with the EGEE, on the VO Services and final version of the Site Security Agreement. Contributions from the VO Privilege External Project: 
   * Gabriele Garzoglio attended the joint Middleware Security Working Group and has an agreement between OSG, EGEE and Globus to have a common protocol in authorization callouts.
    * Igor Sfiligoi built the glExec module on the VDT Build and Test system, for the VDT release. 
    * Igor Sfiligoi worked with Warren Smith of LIGO, Doug Olson, of the OSG security team, the ESNET DOEGrids project, to meet the deliverables for identity processing for LIGO.

*Virtual Data Toolkit and Extensions*

Upgrades were done using VDT scripts by Caltech, Purdue, and SPRACE. A new install using the VDT scripts was done by University of Michigan ATLAS site. The Storage Forum continues to be a useful area for answering questions/resolving problems in sites' storage. An update was done to the static configuration of storage elements gip configuration in VDT to allow the use of glue schema 1.3, which is of course apropos to interoperability. Testing has started with SRM V2.2/dCache 1.8 on the existing storage test system (the FAPL cluster). The new system is in house and will be installed soon. Fermilab is working with UCSD on system tests of the new software. As part of the WLCG deployment group (GSSD) plans for the roll out of dCache 1.8 into the WLCG sites were started. 
The progress in extensions was hampered by a lack of available effort.

*Science Applications and User Support*
 
Support continued for existing and new users on the OSG. Several individuals were registered in the OSG VO and helped to use OSG sites. 
The VO tests were released through a tagged set of software in a CVS repository and documentation on the OSG@Work web pages. These tests verify the basic functioning of OSG sites for users, and can be extended for VO specific tests as needed. 
Some work was done on User Documentation on the OSG@Work web pages ? but there is a lot more left to do here. 

*Administration and Communication*

*Project Management:*
The FY07 Statements of Work were completed except for Wisconsin. The necessary changes were made to transition the Troubleshooting work at the University of Iowa to the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign due to Shaowen Wang?s move. The quarterly expenditures were sent to the Resources Managers. Coordination of the quarterly reports had a varied amount of success. Preparations and presentations were made for the Science Advisory Group which was help on 12th June. The day went well. An Executive Board was held on April 26th, contributions were provided to the Finance Board meeting also held on April 26th. A plan for making the Year 2 program of work was agreed to by the Executive Board and is in progress. High level goals for year2 were documented for review by the area coordinators and work is now proceeding to refine these goals, allocate FTE resources, and create year2 SOWs.

*Administration and Organization*
Fermilab continued to provide support for OSG meetings and workshops, working on the agendas and logistics for the workshops at the end of July.

*Communications and Documentation:*
   * OSG News has been written and distributed for Apr, May, Jun.
 
Anne Heavey, the OSG Communicator, holds weekly Documentation Project meetings and, as the OSG contributing editor, regularly meets with the International Science Grid this week team. Work was done on the training material for the grid school at the University of Texas Brownsville. A new, simpler, install guide for the OSG Compute Element was written and reviewed.  Many of the OSG@WORK web pages were reviewed. 

We contributed to the Campus Infrastructure Days web material, are organizing the hosting of the web site by Xenomedia and will work with a graduate student at the University of Chicago on TeraGrid and an Internet 2 technical writer on content for this web site.

Three research briefs have been written and posted on the OSG web portal:
   * Designing Proteins from Scratch: Scientists are using the OSG to design proteins that adopt specific three dimensional structures and more ambitiously bind and regulate target proteins important in cell biology and pathogenesis. June 2007
   * DZero Doing Double Duty: Data used when calibrating a detector used in High-Energy Physics research is being reused for data analysis. May 2007
   * Little Particles, Big Implications: Neutrinos are tiny, elusive particles that have huge implications for particle physicists. April 2007

Relevant high level OSG Milestones

|Date| Agency Milestone |Status||
|3/1/07|	N	|Complete site functional tests for SRM/dcache production release candidate	Delayed due to lack of effort||
|3/1/07	| N	|User documentation for OSG 0.6	Done||
|3/1/07	| N	|Client tools for site testing of OSG 0.6 site	Done ? VO tests by Chris Green.||
|5/1/2007| 	N	|First audit of  OSG asset	Tests of gatekeeper services in May by the Fermilab team resulted in the release of a Globus software patch. ||
|6/10/07| 	Y	|Complete deployment and registration of 15 Storage Resources using srm/dCache from VDT	Four OSG sites installed srm/dCache from VDT. There are currently 9 Storage elements using the dCache implementation. We will file a change request for this milestone.||
