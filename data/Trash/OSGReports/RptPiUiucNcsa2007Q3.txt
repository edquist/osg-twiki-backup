Key accomplishments 
   * Played a key role in investigating and addressing the problem experienced by LIGO running their workflows on OSG due to a race condition between Globus and Condor-G grid monitor. Proposed test cases in order to validate the correctness of the developed solution before recommending them to the VDT.
   * Addressed firewall configuration problems that were being experienced by OSG users (forwarded from user support).
   * Helped debugging the job status reporting problem between Globus and Condor-G that was being observed at the LTU site by DZero.
   * Worked with Jing Tie from UChicago, to run an application that is based on a statistical tool called R) on various OSG sites. This task covered a wide range of problems ranging from simple issues like non existing local user account to more sophisticated issues like some OSG sites not respecting the RSL initial dir parameter. We also prepared am OSG white paper to record our findings from our troubleshooting experience.
