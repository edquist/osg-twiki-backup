1.1.2.4.x : OSG-Integration support

   * continued setting up resources for NERSC VTB/ITB work
      * maintained VMWARE-VTB cluster for OSG-VTB work 
      * mini-PDSF-dev cluster as an ITB site remains an option (and is now registered) but only as PDSF admin time allows
      * set up 3-machine cluster at LBL for VTB site-  installed SL4 and ready for OSG install 
      * was able to get an installation on jacquard development cluster, but not yet configured as ITB
   * VTB tasks
      * fresh install of 1.6.1 (ITB-0.5.2) prior to 'update' for 1.6.1a
      * tested and reported on 'update' procedure to 1.6.1a
      * participated in weekly VTB meetings
   * ITB tasks
      * was assigned and completed several sub-sections of new documentation
      * took responsibility for WS-GRAM validation testing on ITB
         * initial basic tests forced sites to configure ws gram and discovered documentation holes
         * helped with upgrading documentation
         * developed a testing plan with milestones
         * expanded testing to batch/factory-type and via condor-g (instead of ==globusrun-ws== submission)
         * built static ITB site list specific for ws gram testers
         * began setting up a extended test suite for scale testing
      * participated in weekly ITB meetings

1.1.2.4.x : OSG-Integration support

   * worked on getting resources for NERSC VTB/ITB work 
      * developed model for building PDSF-DEV cluster - in the end, failed due to constraints within PDSF  
      * successfully developed virtual machine cluster (1st XEN, then VMWARE) on local group's server machine
      * ordered a set of 4 machines to be housed at LBNL for use as VTB cluster
      * tried to isolate a mini-PDSF-dev cluster for an ITB site. This will work but only as time allows from PDSF admin
   * used my VMWARE VTB site to participate in VTB activities
      *  installed SGE for use in cluster
      *  registered site with GOC
      *  installed VTB:ce from VDT-1.6.1 and documented sucesses and failures 
   * continued testing of Gratia-SGE probe
   * participated in weekly VTB meetings
   * participated in weekly ITB meetings
   * participated in 2-day ITB installation fest
      * prepared documentation table for updating CE install guide
      * updated action items for documentation needs during the installation fest

   * Presented VTB/ITB planning at local NERSC-GRID meeting
   * Worked on building a separate PDSF cluster for VTB/ITB use
   * Worked on registering NERSC as an OSG Support Center
   * Worked on backup solutions for deploying NERSC VTB site
   * Wrote feedback on OSG Security planning document relative to NERSC
   * Tested new VTB cache by installing wn-client and client 
   * Participated in weekly ITB meetings
   * Participated in new weekly VTB meetings
