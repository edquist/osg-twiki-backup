---+!! 2008Q2 PI Quarterly Report

The uncertainty over the institutional affiliation of South African PI Simon Connell, noted in the last report, has been resolved. He now has a faculty position at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), effective July 1, 2008. UJ is in close geographical proximity to the PI's former institution Wits, and the new plan for the OSG work is to maintain the OSG-supported cluster as part of the Johannesburg Centre for Software Engineering (JCSE) at Wits, as a joint project between UJ (PI: Connell) and Wits (supported by Prof. Scott Hazelhurst, School of Electrical and Information Engineering). Infrastructure support and space will be provided by JCSE, with compute nodes and other cluster hardware provided by both UJ and Wits. OSG funds will continue to support a fraction of a local system administrator/developer for the OSG cluster, and will support modest hardware purchases. 

A major activity during this period has been the planning of an OSG Grid School in South Africa. This will be a 3-day School, closely modeled on the "standard" OSG Grid School, to be hosted at Wits from 23-25 July, 2008. Two OSG-supported instructors (Ben Clifford, and ATLAS Grid expert Horst Severini) will play a key role in the School, presenting many of the lecture and hands-on components. Members of the South African OSG team (Simon Connell, Martin Cook, Norman Ives) are providing additional support, and there will be a number of presentations by local computer scientists on Grid-related topics. A total of 45 registered attendees, from South Africa as well as other African countries, will participate. See: http://neo.phys.wits.ac.za/gridschool/GridSchoolSA/index.html for further details.

The move of Connell from Wits to UJ resulted in the delay of a number of milestones for the South African Grid work. We are now discussing the details of a "recovery plan" that will get the local OSG program back on track. A Change request is in preparation, and if approved, will include a delay of about six months in some milestones, and a change in OSG funding flow to UJ rather than Wits. 

A related development is the recent agreement that UJ (PI: Connell) will join ATLAS, initially as a US-affiliated institution, with the goal of full ATLAS membership in about two years. The OSG cluster will play an important role as the South African group becomes more involved in the analysis of ATLAS data.
