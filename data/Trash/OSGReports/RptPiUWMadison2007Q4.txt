---+++ Management Activities

   1. OSG Review preparation and participation
   2. Participation in EGEE/ELCG Coordination efforts at CERN.
   3. Restarted TeraGrid phone coordination calls.
   4. Participation at Vienna Campus Grid Workshop.
   5. Ongoing: 
      * Facility Coordination - weekly calls, monitoring and guiding the Facility team, decisions re security issues.
      * Technical leadership through the blueprint meetings and the gLite design team meetings.

---+++ Trash/Troubleshooting Activities

Staffing - Jaime Frey was added as a member of the OSG Facility Trash/Troubleshooting team.

   * Performed troubleshooting with OSG sites and VOs (especially CMS) that resulted in the creation of multiple middleware software patches documented below.

   * SAM-Grid complained that Condor-G was very slow in submitting jobs. Worked with SAM-Grid VO to increase Condor-G's limit on the number of jobmanagers running on each gatekeeper to solve the problem.

---+++ Software Activities 

---++++ Middleware improvements 

The following software patches were written at Wisconsin for Condor, Condor-G, and/or Globus to solve problems reported by OSG Troubleshooters, or at the explicit request of VOs.

   * Some time ago, we modified the Globus jobmanager to obtain the job's status from the grid monitor, if available. Less time ago, the grid monitor had to move the location of its job status file. In October 2007, OSG Trash/Troubleshooting activity noticed that the jobmanager was still looking in the old location for the grid monitor job status file. We wrote a patch to have it also look in the new location. 

   * The grid monitor enhancement to not repeatedly query the status of old jobs was tested and incorporated into current Condor-G releases and given to the VDT. The development of this enhancement was mentioned in the 3rd quarter report.

   * Created a patch to fix a problem reported by Fermilab site admins:  Remove unnecessary open attempts on <globus-install-dir>/cert.pem. These were causing numerous syslog entries from automount about /home/condor not existing when using NMI-built binaries. 

   * In our select()-related code in Condor and GCB, we fixed some bugs uncovered by CMS when dealing with file descriptors larger than the current process's getdtablesize(). This can happen if the fds are inherited from the parent process.

   * We fixed a problem uncovered by CMS where the Condor-G schedd had thousands of open fds in CLOSE_WAIT state. This occurred because GCB was accept()ing all connections during a time when the schedd wasn't accept()ing them, then not closing the sockets when the clients did.

   * At the request of CMS, improved the scalability of fork()ing a child process when using GCB and having lots of fds open (especially ones that are hidden from the application by GCB).

   * Fix some bugs that can cause the schedd to crash by running out of fds when trying to send relinquish messages to thousands startds at once. 


---++++ VDT

One of the major tasks for the VDT during this quarter was support for the current OSG software release, 0.8. We released six updates to the VDT, which included many bug fixes, many software updates, and three security updates.

We assisted with the OSG deployment of 0.8, including writing documentation and numerous support request.

We also began development of the new VDT release for OSG 1.0.

We provided a new version of Globus to EGEE with additional bug fixes, and we provided a new build and packaging of the software to support the Debian 4 distribution. 

---+++ Outreach Activities

   * Researched running MPI jobs on various OSG resources.
   * Wrote user documents describing how to run MPI on OSG resources.
   * Interviewed several potential OSG users, especially many wanting to run parallel jobs -- cleared up many misunderstanding about what OSG can offer.
   * Worked with Ken Judd to grid-enable his dynamic-programming code in preparation for running on OSG.
   * Worked with PNNL to recompile and adapt their codes to run on the grid.
