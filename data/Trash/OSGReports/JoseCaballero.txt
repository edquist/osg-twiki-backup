---+++ 1st quarter
---++++ January 2009
   * First week on vacations.

   * Panda Data Movement:
      * Check if LFC python API is imported in script pdm_file_register.py, avoiding using it to register checksum and filesize in LFC catalog when the library is not available. New error code to raise an exception when users try to register checksum and filesize but the API cannot be imported.
      * Allowing specify several pilot DNs at a time to delegate end users proxies to a myproxy server from pathena.
      * Studying to configure the myproxy-server to allow retrieval based on FQAN, instead of using option -Z with myproxy-init.
   
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * Studying how to split runJob.py into three scripts (one for stage-in, one to run athena, one for stage-out) so each part can be run under gLExec or not separately, as a site policy.

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Preparation for the workshop in Chile, as member of the outreach and education team. Learning the lessons, testing the exercises, testing the software and tools installed on the workshop machine....
      * Trip to Chile. 
      * Writing to Ruth and people from the Outreach team my feedback and feelings after the trip to Chile. Translation into English the comments from the students (written in Spanish).
      * Starting with the translation into Spanish of the documentation for training courses.

   

---++++ February 2009

   * Panda Data Movement:
      * Edition of the Panda Data Movement wiki page.
      * pdmUtils.py created containing common classes and function for the pdm scripts. The content of errors.py has been moved also into pdmUtils.py
        Twiki updated acordingly
      * Refactorization of the code to make it more readable, easier to maintain, more scalable, and more consistent with the operations performed.
      * Started the development of a script pdm_get.py to recover information registered in the LFC catalog.
  
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda: 
      * Preparing poster for CHEP'09.

---++++ March 2009
   * First week on the OSG All Hands Meeting at LIGO: attending talks and arranging private meetings (Alina, Igor, Mine, and Alan Roy)

   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * Finishing the testing of the gLExec/SCAS installation at !Gridka, to check if problems with expired voms attributes have been already fixed. 
      * Implementing comments from authors in the poster for CHEP.        

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Phone meeting with Alina Bejan and people from Colombia to start the organization of a workshop in Colombia in August/September. 
      * Reading the document the Outreach Team has about how to organize a workshop. Looks like Ruth wants I am in charge of the whole organization of an event in Brazil and a following up event in Chile, with Alina helping me, instead the opposite.

   * ATLAS Software and Computing Workshop at CERN.
      * Attending presentations.
      * Meeting with Charles Waldman on Tuesday to discuss about his HTTPS LFC interface. We found a few weak points in his design. We discusses about several improvements. He agrees I include his interface in my generic catalog interface, and I have offered him my web based read-only interface (the one I made with django). He liked it and probably will include my code in his project.
      * Meeting with Paul Nilsson on Tuesday to teach me about the structure of pilot code, and to give me some tasks to do. 
      * Meeting with SCAS people on Tuesday (Massimo, Antonio Retico, and Gianni Pucciani), requested by me and scheduled by Massimo. Attending, this time in person, on Friday, the regular SCAS/gLExec meeting.

   * CHEP at Prague

   * !PanDA/pilot:
      * Started cleaning up the pilot wrappers code (suggested by Paul Nilsson): deleting orphan variables and orphan functions, deleting commented out lines, removing global variables when not needed, splitting long functions in several short functions, sorting lists, etc...

---+++ 2nd quarter
---++++ April 2009
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * Writing the proceedings for the CHEP
      * Phone meetings with EGEE people (about SCAS/gLExec installation): still problems with installation in !IN2P3, UK sites are going to collaborate.
      * Changes in the myproxyUtils.py interface: 
         * bugs fixing
         * allowing DN with parentheses to avoid the !MyProxy servers reads them as regexp syntax
         * allowing a list of DNs instead of a single DN as authorized retrievers.

   * !PanDA/pilot:
      * More cleaning up the wrappers pilot code [thinPilotWrapper.sh, !ProdPilotThin.py, trans-atlasprod-thin.sh] 
      * Implementing the code to pick up randomly (99%-1%) one package from libcode [trans-atlasprod-thin.sh]
      * Merge of !ProdPilotThin.py and trans-atlasprod-thin.sh in one single script

   * !Panda/USATLAS:
      * Attending some sessions of the US workshop at BNL on Apr 14th and 15th

   * !Panda/monitoring:
      * Phone meeting to discuss about the Alexei's students ideas. 

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Communication with Julio Ibarra and Heidi Alvarez, from the University of Chicago, to find out how to get funding for the workshop in Colombia. They propose to use the program NSF/PASI, but the deadline is 15th January. 
      * Trying to clarify my responsibilities, with no success. 

---++++ May 2009
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * Finishing the refactorization of the code.
      * Enhancing the documentation.
      * Periodical retrieval implemented as a thread. That solution is the safer one: if the parent process dies the child dies also; that avoid having a process working forever on the WN retrieving proxies which can be stolen by bad guys.
      * Phone meetings with EGEE people about SCAS/gLExec installation.
      * Proceedings submitted to Journal of Physics.
      * Testing the installation at Lancaster. Complicate. A lot of problems. Many emails between Peter Love, Oscar Koeroo, Maarten and myself. Problems also to delegate proxies from BNL when environment variable !GT_PROXY_MODE is setup with value "old".
      * Contacting Jim Basney and Alain Roy to find out when the new version of !MyProxy client will be released officially (new versions fix problems during delegation when !GT_PROXY_MODE is set up to old). 
      * Working with Paul Nilsson to split runJob.py into three different modules (for stage-in, run the payload, stage-out)

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Trying to find out how to fund longing for students in a possible workshop in Colombia.
      * Contact with Chilean people to see if there is interest in a follow-up workshop. They say "yes".
      * Commenting with Jim Shank the option of supporting partially a workshop in Colombia by ATLAS. 

   * !PanDA/monitoring:
      * Phone meeting to discuss about the Alexei's students work
      * Re-creating the structure in /panda-monitor/ directory within the svn repository to allocate the new code developed by Dmitry.
      * Directory branches/ created in svn.

   * !PanDA/pilot:
      * Removed warning messages when command `which python32` and `which voms-proxy-info` fail. Users have complained a lot about these messages.
      * Removed old not needed files from svn. 

   * !PanDA Data Movement:
      * Subdirectory for pdm scripts created in the repository. 
      * A new project (including the whole structure: current/ and tags/ directories, (empty) config files for guidance, etc.) created in the svn repository. 
      * Testing the data-host project. 
      * Directory branches/ created in svn

---++++ June 2009
   * !PanDA:
      * cleaning up the svn repository: 
         * old not used projects tags/ and branches/ removed
         * non standard config files removed from some projects
         * new project panda-pilot/ created,  and whole content from pilot3/  migrated. 
         * old project osgddm/ removed; we are already using panda-osgddm/.
         * content of panda-osgddm/ split into two subprojects:  osgddm-client/ and osgddm-server/. Also osgddm-common/ created, just in case we need it in the future. Two sets of setup files (for packaging and distribution) created, so far empty (they have to be filled).
      * Some improvements in the autopilot wiki page. 

   * !PanDA Data Movement:
      * Testing the data-host project. Proposing improvements. 
      * I have repeated the installation, but using sqlite3 instead of mysql as backend database. It works fine. 

   * Outreach activities:
      * A lot of emails with the Colombian people. 
      * I have contacted Marta Losada (coordinator of ATLAS-Colombia), and put her in contact with Jim Shank. 
      * We have started to discuss about calendar and schedule for the workshop in Colombia.

   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into !PanDA:
      * More tests at Lancaster and !GridKa, trying to understand why they fail (again problems with expired VOMS attributes). Discussion with Oscar Koeroo and Maarten Litmaath about this. 
      * Trying to find out ways to bypass this problem in the meanwhile (regenerating the voms attributes on the WN in a safe way). Testing the Tadashi's proposal, with no success. 
      * Setting !GT_PROXY_MODE='old' on the WN (if needed) before the retrieval, and unsetting it after the retrieval.  
      * Testing the scripts that Nikhef guys have written to pack and unpack the environment. They don't work since they need a non-standard PERL library. Anyway, I don't like them due their lack of flexibility. 
      * Testing the new pilot code, and trying to split it into two processes (stagein+payload and stageout).

---+++ 3rd quarter
---++++ July 2009
 
   * !PanDA:
      * Testing recipe http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576704/ to reduce the size of the pilotcode tarball.
      * Fixed bug in pilot wrapper throwing a harmless error message when g++32 is not on the WN. 
      * new project in svn created, with the whole structure and (empty to be filled asap) packaging and distribution files:
          <verbatim>
              /svn/panda/common-utils/
                                 |
                                 |----  tags/
                                 |

                                          |
                                          |---- INSTALL.txt
                                          |---- MANIFEST.in

                                          |---- setup.py
         </verbatim>
      * Some modules added to common-utils:
         * Patterns.py: with a class to handle threads (so far just for periodical tasks), a class to perform command line operations. 
         * pyminifier.py: copied from recipe http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576704/
         * argparse.py: customized version improved to raise my own exceptions and to split options between several namespaces 

   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into !PanDA:
      * Regular phone meetings with EGEE people.
      * More tests at Lancaster. Finally they work. Problems with expired VOMS attributes fixed.    
      * Still trying to split runJob.py into two modules. Problem: forking implementation in the pilot framework. Replacing execvpe() by os.system() + sys.exit() does not work. 
      * Script multipleTestJobs.py created to perform a loop over /home/sm/nilsson/subversion/offline/Production/panda/testJob.py in order to submit more than one single job to a given queue/cloud. 

   * ATLAS:
      * Joining ADC meetings.

   * CHEP09: 
      * reviewing the article I am referee of. 

---++++ August 2009

   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into !PanDA:
      * More tests. Problems with pilot understood: stagein and stageout have not anymore the same pid than the parent process, which is checked in some point in pilot.py
      * Contacted Lancaster admin system to request the Nurcan's proxy being allowed to call gLExec. 

   * !PanDA:
      * Improvements in the content and documentation of the generic tools I am putting in /svn/common-utils/
      * class Logging implemented in module patterns.py to handle message logging. It is an extension of function tolog(). Using timestamp is optional, and its format is configurable. Stdout or a file to write the message is an input option.
      * The name of the module which is invoking tolog() is added to the messages printed out. 

   * Outreach activities:
      * contacted people at Colombia to find out how the workshop plans are going. Seems like it will be during October. 

---++++ September 2009

   * First week at CERN: ATLAS Software & Computing week. 

   * !PanDA:
      * Tested the tool to reduce the size of pilot tarball. It does not work. Creating my own one, much simpler but working. 
      * Meeting with Xin Zhao, Suchandra and Rob Gardner. The goal is to adapt PanDA (new site/queue, transformation scripts and maybe specific view in the monitoring) to submit testing jobs to validate ITBs. Once I get expertise doing that I can apply that knowledge to other people like DUSEL guys, or even for outreach. 

   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into !PanDA:
      * end-user proxy cannot be read by the payload after identity switch, because it has permissions 600. If I change permissions, gLExec complains. I have to copy the proxy and makes the second copy more readable. But then I need a third copy, because a proxy credential with permissions other than 600 are not valid (i.e. LFC commands complains). Investigating how to bypass this problem using a specific env var provided by gLExec itself: GLEXEC_TARGET_PROXY.  
      * A bug in myproxyInterface parsing input options fixed.
      * Running payload under gLExec and stage-out under pilot identity works.
      * Trying to run payload and stage-out both under gLExec. Problems with permissions to create new directories in pnfs/dCache and in LFC. Temporarily I am changing the permissions of parent directories by hand, just trying to run the job until the very end. 

   * Outreach activities:
      * Alina has left !UoC. Now I am the leader for the workshop at Bogota. Looking for an expert in sys admin. Meeting at Chicago with Rob Gardner, Marco Mambelli and Suchandra to organize the workshop, from Wed Sep 30 to Fri Oct 2.

---+++ 4th quarter
---++++ October 2009

   * Two days at Chicago in a private meeting with Rob Gardner, Suchandra, Marco Mambelli and Charles Waldman. Topic discussed:
      * workshop at Bogota
      * panda framework for ITBs testing
      * pilot/pcache integration

   * Outreach activities:
      * A lot of emails with people at Chicago and Colombia to organize the workshop in Bogota. Experts we contacted for remote talks are declining. 
      * Try to collect exercises and slides from different sources to give in Bogota a module focused on Information System + Brokering.
      * Skype meeting with Rob and others in Chicago.
      * Testing with John Hover the ITB at BNL to submit jobs belonging VO OSGEDU.
      * Preparing slides for my talks: refactorization from slides I used in Chile. 

      * Workshop at Bogota for two week: http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2832

   * Autopilot:
      * Collection documentation about how !PanDA works (queues, sites, tags, pilot types,...) and how the script to handle the specifications work (pilotController.py) 
      * Removing everything related myproxy and gLExec from autopilot scripts, since myproxyUtils.py is gone from that directory
      * Fixing the name of the server in many files, they still had the BNL server name. 
      * Supporting CHARMM guys activities, now they are trying it again. 

   * gLExec:
      * Testing the new installation of gLExec at ITB at BNL. 

   * OSG ITB Integration:
      * I am in contact with Suchandra (Chicago) and Iwona Sakrejda (LBNL) to create a panda framework for ITB testing. 
      * Investigating the best way to do it (create new panda queues? reusing the already existing queues? creating a tag? creating a new panda pilot for this purpose?)

   * OGF27:
      * Attending the Open Grid Forum at Banff (Canada)

---++++ November 2009
   * Outreach:
      * Some post-workshop activities through the mailing list created for the event (sending them useful information, answering questions, follow-up of activities).

   * Autopilot:
      * Problem with RC = 60 fixed (pilot was not sending the proxy to the server)
      * Supporting CHARMM guys activities. They need to have osg role=pilot to work to be accepted by the server. 
      * Learning how to pass input options to the jobs at the time of the job submission instead of the pilot submission. 
      * Updating the documentation: https://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/AtlasSoftware/AutoPilot#Scheduling_and_monitoring_pilots
      * Testing cross-VO interoperability in !PanDA: pilots belonging VO "A" can pick up jobs belonging VO "B". Is that acceptable?
      * Changes in the wrapper (atlasProdPilotWrapper) to source, when exists, OSG_APP/atlas_app/atlas_rel/local/setup.sh

   * Pilot:
      * !LocalSiteMover.py modified to pass the !GUID to lsm-put and lsm-get when required. 

   * Panda job submission:
      * Creation of a new script for end users job submission: sendJob. It is just an improved version of toPanda (raising exceptions when the input from command line are not correct). 
      * Creation of a project on SVN for this tool.

   * OSG ITB Integration:
      * Started with the configuration (processsingType="ITB_Integration") and tests for ITB Integration. Using fake jobs provided by Suchandra.  
      * Attending the OSG Integration meetings.  
      * Helping Suchandra to fix problems with the !UoC site. Its jobmanager is not sending back the output and error files. 
      * Running a script called site_verify.pl, provided by Xin, at BNL and UoC.
      * Suchandra is testing the new code for jobs submissions.
      * Contact with LBNL guys (Iwona and Doug) to get all the needed information to create a panda site for them.

   * CERN-VM:
      * In contact with Arturo Sanchez, and others, to help with !PanDA virtualization. 
      * Question: is really BOINC a good platform to run ATLAS software?

   * DUSEL:
      * Meeting with DUSEL guys to discuss about their needs, and the convenience of using Panda for their activities. 
      * Helping them with the first steps: grid certificates request, joining the OSG VO, creation of their own VO. 

---++++ December 2009
   * First week at CERN, attending the ATLAS Computing and Software Workshop.
   * Informal ATLAS Distributed Computing Workshop at BNL

   * OSG ITB Integration:
      * File glite/vomses created. 
      * Certificate files needed to create proxies for OSG VO copied and cron created to renew the proxy. 
      * Cron to submit pilots to UC setup.
      * Testing the gatekeeper/jobmanager at LBNL, Caltech and FNAL: for a while they did not work, or they do not accept role /osg/role=pilot which what we have decided to use for the pilots.  
      * Attending ITB meetings. 
      * Seting up a panda site for LBNL.
      * Testing panda sites for LBNL, BNL_ITB and Caltech. They are not working for some reason (cloud=none?, ddm=none?, status=none?...)

   * !gLExec:
      * Attending gLExec/Argus meetings.
      * Testing the script provided by the developers to create a directory owned by the end user. It does not fix my problems (I have to give some files and directories world wide permissions to read/write). 

   * Autopilot:
      * Problems with !SimplePilot fixed: the new modules on the server reject getJob requests when some unexpected variable is passed. I have removed all not needed variables from the requests.  
      * Trivial version of wrapper created (and added in the pilots block in pilotController), with minimum level of verbosity: !trivialWrapper.sh and !trivialPilot.py

   * Panda Job Submission:
      * Starting to write the documentation for the new submission tool sendJob.py

   * DUSEL:
      * Live demo on how to submit jobs and pilots, use the monitor, etc. 
      * Answering a lot of questions: about grid certificates, submission with condor-g, panda architecture...
      * Helping them to start working with grid certificates, roles, etc, and sending jobs to panda. 
      * Helping Mats Rynge (one of the Engage VO admins) to setup a role=pilot in the VO Engage. 

   * CERNVM:
      * Panda queue created for CERNVM.

---++ 2010
---+++ 1st quarter
---++++ January 2010
   * First week on vacations.

   * Panda/Pilot/Autopilot:
      * As requested by John Hover (to rid of gridui04), moving files and scripts belonging sm account from gridui04 to pandadev01
      * Investigating why sometimes the output file is empty. Seems to be a problem with Chicago sites. 

   * gLExec:
      * Resume of development. All refactorization to split runJob.py into two modules not valid anymore. Paul proposes a new model, running a single module twice. 
      * Allowing the retrieval of long lifetime proxies, instead of 12 h long proxies. Removing the periodical retrieval. 
      * Installation at BNL seems not to work properly. My tests are failing. Working with John and Xin to understand the problem. 
      * Modifying the last version of pilot code to use group process ID instead of process ID. 

   * Outreach:
      * Preparing the workshop at Bucaramanga (Colombia).
      * Meeting with Carlos Gamboa and John Hover to discuss the role of Carlos during the next workshop.
      * Phone meeting with Rob Garder, Carlos Gamboa and people from Colombia to discuss logistic.

   * OSG ITB Integration:
      * Working with Alden and Maxim to fix problems with some of the new panda sites.
      * Attending phone meetings. 
      * pilotCron_OSG fixed to avoid duplicated code.
      * trivialWrapper tested. Cron on gridui07 changed to use it. NOTE: the output still contains ATLAS stuffs which I must to eliminate.
      * Removing manageData from trivialPilot.py to avoid some ATLAS specific messages in the out/log files.
      * Fixing the name of the script in trivialWrapper.sh to avoid misleading messages.

   * Panda for non-ATLAS users:
      * Exchange of emails with Ian Stokes-Rees and Peter Doherty about Panda for SBGRID/LifeSciences.  

---++++ February 2010
   * Panda/Pilot/Autopilot:
      * Finished the implementation of a check in pUtil to print out the module invoking function tolog()

   * OSG ITB Integration:
      * Discussion with Steven Timm from FNAL about the best way to pass the payload proxy to invoke gLExec. After reading our CHEP paper he agrees with adopting the same mechanism than ATLAS. 
      * Testing gridFTP to stage-out the output files. Studying how to pass to the pilot the destinationURL, so far the only way seems to be embedded in jobParameters, which I do not like. 
      * trivialWrapper.sh was overriding the OSG PATH env var, fixed.
      * Stageing-out  the output files with gridFTP if the user requests it.  
      * Attending the phone meetings. 

   * Panda for non-ATLAS users:
      * Exchange of emails with Ian Stokes-Rees and Peter Doherty about SBGRID/LifeSciences. 
      * Phone meeting with Ian and Peter... 
      * prodSourceLabel=standalone allows end users to setup the job priority using --currentPriority
      * Seems to be a VO at FNAL for LBNE. They are adding the BNL guys into it. 
      * Helping Tim Miller (CHARMM) to improve operations. His condor queue was collapsed with thousands of idle pilots. BNL_ITB_Install removed from the tag CHARMM. Looking for more sites to included under the tag CHARMM.
      * Joining the weekly VOs meeting to discuss how to improve CHARMM's productivity.
      * Functions added to trivialPilot.py to get the queue parameters (a la queuedata in atlas pilot) to find out if the site requires glexec. 
      * Debugging why jobs sent to BNL_ITB_Test1 by Yuri are not being picked up by any pilot. Two reasons: different prodSourceLabel between jobs and pilots, and jobs were atlas production jobs which have no URL for the transformation script.
      * Working with Tim Miller to find out why all his pilots are failing (again!). Many reasons: bugs in several queue definitions in schedconfig (with extra quotations, \n, etc.), sites down, using obsolete panda sites, etc. I have asked interactive access to CHARMM pilot submission host to check log files myself easily. 

   * gLExec/Panda integration:
      * Added a list of excluded env var. The env var in this list must not be recreated when glexec is invoked, so they must not go to the wrapper. The get() method adds default values to the ones set by the user. 
      * Removing a lot of garbage (prints out, checks, etc.) from myproxyUtils.py
      * Problems to run glexec at BNL fixed.
      * Talk at the T1/T2/T3 Jamboree. 
      * Using GLEXEC_TARGET_PROXY the end user proxy does not belong to the pilot anymore, so the pilot cannot remove it at the end. It has to be removed from the wrapper. 

   * Outreach:
      * Discussion with Rob Gardner to prepare the workshop at Colombia.
