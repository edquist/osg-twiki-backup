---+++ January 2009
   * First week on vacations.

   * Panda Data Movement:
      * Check if LFC python API is imported in script pdm_file_register.py, avoiding using it to register checksum and filesize in LFC catalog when the library is not available. New error code to raise an exception when users try to register checksum and filesize but the API cannot be imported.
      * Allowing specify several pilot DNs at a time to delegate end users proxies to a myproxy server from pathena.
      * Studying to configure the myproxy-server to allow retrieval based on FQAN, instead of using option -Z with myproxy-init.
   
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * Studying how to split runJob.py into three scripts (one for stage-in, one to run athena, one for stage-out) so each part can be run under gLExec or not separately, as a site policy.

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Preparation for the workshop in Chile, as member of the outreach and education team. Learning the lessons, testing the exercises, testing the software and tools installed on the workshop machine....
      * Trip to Chile. 
      * Writing to Ruth and people from the Outreach team my feedback and feelings after the trip to Chile. Translation into English the comments from the students (written in Spanish).
      * Starting with the translation into Spanish of the documentation for training courses.

   

---+++ February 2009

   * Panda Data Movement:
      * Edition of the Panda Data Movement wiki page.
      * pdmUtils.py created containing common classes and function for the pdm scripts. The content of errors.py has been moved also into pdmUtils.py
        Twiki updated acordingly
      * Refactorization of the code to make it more readable, easier to maintain, more scalable, and more consistent with the operations performed.
      * Started the development of a script pdm_get.py to recover information registered in the LFC catalog.
  
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda: 
      * Preparing poster for CHEP'09.
      * Studing how to split runJob in three processes (stagein, payload, stageout). 
      * Studing what people in EGEE are doing with gLExec and its integration with SCAS. 
      * Phone meetings (19 Feb, 26 Feb)
      * Testing gLExec/SCAS installation at Gridka.

   * Outreach activities: 
      * Translation from English into Spanish of the material for training courses (work in progress).

   * Clound Computing:
      * Reading some documentation.

---+++ March 2009
   * First week on the OSG All Hands Meeting at LIGO: attending talks and arranging private meetings (Alina, Igor, Mine, and Alan Roy)

   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * finishing the testing of the gLExec/SCAS installation at Gridka, to check if problems with expired voms attributes have been already fixed. 
      * implementing comments from authors in the poster for CHEP.        

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Phone meeting with Alina Bejan and people from Colombia to start the organization of a workshop in Colombia in August/September. 
      * Reading the document the Outreach Team has about how to organize a workshop. Looks like Ruth wants I am in charge of the whole organization of an event in Brazil and a following up event in Chile, with Alina helping me, instead the opposite.

   * ATLAS Software and Computing Workshop at CERN.
      * attending presentations.
      * Meeting with Charles Waldman on Tuesday to discuss about his HTTPS LFC interface. We found a few weak points in his design. We discusses about several improvements. He agrees I include his interface in my generic catalog interface, and I have offered him my web based read-only interface (the one I made with django). He liked it and probably will include my code in his project.
      * Meeting with Paul Nilsson on Tuesday to teach me about the structure of pilot code, and to give me some tasks to do. 
      * Meeting with SCAS people on Tuesday (Massimo, Antonio Retico, and Gianni Pucciani), requested by me and scheduled by Massimo. Attending, this time in person, on Friday, the regular SCAS/gLExec meeting. 
      * Report of my tests of th gLExec installation at GridKa during the distributed analysis session.

   * CHEP at Prague

   * !PanDA/pilot:
      * started cleaning up of the pilot code (suggested by Paul Nilsson)
