   * Panda Data Movement:
      * Check if LFC python API is imported in script pdm_file_register.py, avoiding using it to register checksum and filesize in LFC catalog when the library is not available. New error code to raise an exception when users try to register checksum and filesize but the API cannot be imported.
      * Allowing specify several pilot DNs at a time to delegate end users proxies to a myproxy server from pathena.
      * Studying to configure the myproxy-server to allow retrieval based on FQAN, instead of using option -Z with myproxy-init.
   
   * gLExec and !MyProxy integration into Panda:
      * Studying how to split runJob.py into three scripts (one for stage-in, one to run athena, one for stage-out) so each part can be run under gLExec or not separately, as a site policy.

   * Outreach Activities:
      * Preparation for the workshop in Chile, as member of the outreach and education team. Learning the lessons, testing the exercises, testing the software and tools installed on the workshop machine....
