---+2009
---++ January 2009
   * Engagement:
      * letters discussing the potential for collaboration sent to multiple organizations including:
         * Vice President for research of Columbia U, Vice President for research of SUNY Stony Brook, Vice Chancellor for Research at CUNY
         * Provost for Research of NYU (got a reply that they don't need us now but will keep in mind) 
         * two research groups at the BNL Biology Department and a research group at CFNM (Nanomaterials) - a number of different projects
      * received a reply from NYSGRID, to a letter sent a month earlier (telling us to wait)
      * Nonproliferation and Security Department (NNS) engagement project:
         * established the "embarrasingly parallel" task flow for the project (image analysis for material science)
         * tested necessary code adaptations
         * processed existing data for the experiment, using the IDL installation on Jacquard (NERSC)
         * awaiting further data
   * Running test jobs against three OSG sites (Nebraska, Purdue, Jacquard)
   * AHM preparation activity (co-convenor of applications workshop)
   * Helping CHARMM with testing MPI against Purdue

---++ February 2009
   * Engagement - further letters discussing the potential for collaboration sent to (a) LSST computing (b) Atmospheric research Division at BNL (no replies from either)
   * other OSG activity:
      * contributed to policy document on jobs tracking on OSG (Gabriele)
      * continued the All Hands Meeting preparation activity
   * production script debugging: updateQueues - cvs and python configuration issues found, as well as a fix:
      * cvs requires to set the SSH variable to RSH, which is not always achieved or guaranteed when switching shells, but can be sourced in user scripts
      * the "default" python path differs between development and production machines in that the latter has the dq2 directory tree (fix - copy over and add to PYTHONPATH)
   * Pilot Factory
      * recreated the PF cron jobs (lost in host software upgrade) and cloned the entries on pandadev03 as a testing case
      * finished the setup of scripts and configuration on pandadev03
      * feedback and help from Barnett will be crucial
   * CHEP: started poster preparation
   * Misc: Pilot Framework follow-up with WLCG

---++ March 2009
   * Updated data aggregation script, version in SVN
   * OSG activity:
      * Pilot Framework presentation at the WLCG meeting
      * Area Coordinators report on current status of Panda WMS (OSG EB)
      * Participated in All Hands Meeting of OSG at LIGO, co-chaired a parallel session
   * Atlas software week: multiple discussions with Atlas (Massimo, A.Retico et al), testing plans
   * Follow-up with SCAS installation at !IN2P3
   * Prepared poster presentation for CHEP'09; participated in CHEP'09

---++ April 2009
   * OSG: Reporting to Brian Bockelman on internal metrics for Panda, 
   * Investigating a web server-based data hosting as a lightweight data transfer mechanism for small VOs using Panda
      * learning curve with Django
   * Pilot scheduler for gridka and !IN2P3
   * coordinating with non-proliferation department regarding the next batch of data to be processed
   * work on CHEP'09 publications
   * presentation at the North Carolina Grid School (Panda)

---++ May 2009
   * Created and documented a working prototype of VO data hosting service (data transport for Panda Pilots) based on Django
      *  features: user authentication and authorization, file management functionality, messaging system for users
      * Apache deployment tested with jobs running at NERSC and pulling data from the Datahost
      * in addition to Web API, command line interface - suite of utilities based on curl, with comprehensive functionality
      * SSL functionality tested with Web interface, is being debugged with curl access mode
   * OSG
      * CHARMM support (resources, negotiating with Nebraska)
      * EB (area coordinator meetings) reporting on WMS
   * Misc: finished work on CHEP contributions


---++ June 2009
   * SSL inerface for Datahost
   * Pilot adaptation for Datahost

---++ Near-term plans
   * Continue the Pilot Factory testing
   * Do technical work to facilitate MPI applications running on Panda
   * Keep on working on the Non-Proliferation project (with a prospect of publication)
