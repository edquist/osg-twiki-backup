%TOC%

---++ August 2007
   * Study of the Condor system
   * Evaluation of the pilot glidein (with Barnett)
   * Setting up a testbed for the evaluation of WMS
      * Installed components: Apache server, PostgreSQL, RRD Tool
      * certificates issue resolved
      * Made suggestions to Igor regarding the robustness of the installation script
      * first tests run successfully, need to adjust the glidein factory
   * Participation in the OSG User Support meetings (ongoing)

---++ September 2007
   * Successful test of the Panda Pilot submission via the glideinWMS mechanism
   * Identified issues related to that approach:
      * idling glideins occupy batch slots (unacceptable)
      * poor scalability of GCB at this point (vulnerability!)
      * non-scalability of Condor-G mitigated by effective throttling of glidein submission in the glideinWMS system, however underlying issues are not resolved
   * Investigating the application of the sha1sum checksum mechanism to Panda security
   * Work with Mats Rynge on the MPI implementation on various Grid sites
      * complex subject, highlights in recent (10 Aug.) paper by Mats and others. Issues:
         * loss of the cluster-specific, dynamic MPI environment during the submission of Globus jobs
         * lack of standards in the interconnect versions, compilers and libraries location
      * CHARMM project migration to MPI (wanted to implement SMP first, then MPI)
         * identified Purdue as the best candidate site for deployment
         * Preston Smith at Purdue contacted, both SMP and MPI approaches should be available at that site
         * planning initial testing at Purdue

---++ October 2007
   * Facilitation of the CHARMM MPI deployment at Purdue
   * Site characterization (discussions with Preston, Mats, Gabriele -- CEMon/GIP)
   * Presentation at the DDM/Panda workshop regarding our evaluation of the glideinWMS
   * review of the Pilot Factory code
   * Participation in the OSG Blueprint Workshop at FNAL:
      * WMS roadmap - adoption of glideinWMS vs Panda; need interaction with site admins to determine pros and cons of each
      * M.Potekhin assigned the task of the WMS delivery into the OSG release
      * site characterization - autiomation; human input inevitable anyway; boilerplate
      * MPI policy going forward
      * future plans - resource allocation system design; 

---++ November 2007
   * Participated in the "Panda performance and reliability" planning exercise with RACF
   * Finalized Statement of Work (OSG/BNL)
   * Started planning for the All-Hands Meeting as a part of User Support activity
   * Created a Work Plan for R.Popescu
   * Started pilot submission to MPI queue at Purdue, issues identified

---++ December 2007
   * Commenced testing of the local glExec installation at BNL
   * Worked out refinements regarding pilot submission accounts and VOMS annotations
   * Proposed changes to GLUE schema for site characterization
   * Continued All-Hands Meeting preparations, in particular the Bio-session

---++ January 2008
   * Assumed responsibility for the User Meeting to be held at BNL, initial planning
   * Worked with OSG VOs to shape presentations at the Bio-session at All-Hands
   * Debugging of the glExec configuration issues
   * Aided in finishing the main development of the Pilot Factory (Barnett)
   * Helped a new team member (Jose Caballero) with initial consultations etc
   * Started contacts with EGEE on the subject of pilot interoperability

---++ February 2008
   * Planning for the Annual OSG User Meeting under way
   * Finalized the content and format of the Bio-session at All-Hands (with Mats and others)
   * Participation in the OSG Blueprint Workshop at FNAL:
      * Panda and glideinWMS recognized as de facto Workload Management Systems that are to co-exist undet the OSG umbrells
      * Discussion of the "job footprint concept as a part of a larger storage resource management for grid jobs
      * Useful discussion of the "pilot role" (i.e. a specialized VOMS annotaion) and pilot accounts associated with such
   * Ran a complete and successful test of glExec-enabled pilot job in Panda
 
---++ March 2008
   * Participation in the OSG All-Hands Meeting in Chapel Hill
      * co-coordinated the Bio Sciences session of the Meeting
   * Dates and initial programme for the Annual OSG User (F2F) Meeting finalized (June 16th-17th) based on recommendations of User Support and EB
      * Initial list of prospective participans compiled, first announcement sent out
   * Initial plans to meet the evolving needs of OSG Engage and user community by enhancing Panda monitoring capabilities and UI
      * need to create a better and more user-friendly UI for end-users
      * need to automate and integrate job submission into Panda proper
   * Presented the BNL Workload Management effort and plans for EB
   * Coordination of R.Popescu's work on stress test preparation, with Aaron Thor.

---++ April 2008
   * Indico web page set up, for the Annual OSG User (F2F) Meeting; other organizational work under way.
   * Created an abstract for the HPDC conference in June (VO management in Panda)
   * Coordination of Panda MPI job submission at Purdue
   * Ongoing participation in the UG and EB meetings
   * Contacts with EGEE personnel in Lyon and CERN regarding the possibility of Panda pilot / glexec test setup
   * Participated in the WLCG/Atlas workshop at CERN; technical discussions with Maarten, Massimo and others, topics:
      * immediate efforts by EGEE to finalize glexec integration with LCMAPS (this got going)
      * plans to better manage resource allocation in Panda

---++ May 2008
   * the June Users' (F2F) Meeting  at BNL preparations
      * further edits to the indico pages + work with Linda on various logistics issues

   * Initial version of the VO-info and VO-resource schemas created
   * Panda stress test setup
      * coordinated Aaron's activity
      * helped create a modified version of the standard Panda Pilot, with parameterization of job execution time, to be used as the job simulator
      * host monitoring script prepared for testing
   * Panda DB migration coordinated, new servers tested
   * learning curve with DB table schemas and relations
   * started work on ldapsearch integration with the Panda database loading script
   * looked into the proxy delegation to Panda server, via an Apache module (to be cont'd)

---++ June 2008
   * ongoing Panda stress test
   * working on parser for the ldapsearch utility
   * RRDtool interface for the host monitoring script
