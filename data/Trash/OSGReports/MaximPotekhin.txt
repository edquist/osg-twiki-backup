%TOC%

---++ August 2007
   * Study of the Condor system 
   * Evaluation of the pilot glidein (with Barnett) 
   * Setting up a testbed for the evaluation of WMS 
      * Installed components: Apache server, PostgreSQL, RRD Tool 
      * certificates issue resolved 
      * Made suggestions to Igor regarding the robustness of the installation script 
      * first tests run successfully, need to adjust the glidein factory 
   * Participation in the OSG User Support meetings (ongoing) 

---++ September 2007
   * Successful test of the Panda Pilot submission via the glideinWMS mechanism 
   * Identified issues related to that approach: 
      * idling glideins occupy batch slots (unacceptable) 
      * poor scalability of GCB at this point (vulnerability!) 
      * non-scalability of Condor-G mitigated by effective throttling of glidein submission in the glideinWMS system, however underlying issues are not resolved 
   * Investigating the application of the sha1sum checksum mechanism to Panda security 
   * Work with Mats Rynge on the MPI implementation on various Grid sites 
      * complex subject, highlights in recent (10 Aug.) paper by Mats and others. Issues: 
         * loss of the cluster-specific, dynamic MPI environment during the submission of Globus jobs 
         * lack of standards in the interconnect versions, compilers and libraries location 
      * CHARMM project migration to MPI (wanted to implement SMP first, then MPI) 
         * identified Purdue as the best candidate site for deployment 
         * Preston Smith at Purdue contacted, both SMP and MPI approaches should be available at that site 
         * planning initial testing at Purdue 

---++ October 2007
   * Facilitation of the CHARMM MPI deployment at Purdue 
   * Site characterization (discussions with Preston, Mats, Gabriele -- CEMon/GIP)

   * review of the Pilot Factory code 
   * Participation in the OSG Blueprint Workshop at FNAL: 
      * WMS roadmap - adoption of glideinWMS vs Panda; need interaction with site admins to determine pros and cons of each 
      * M.Potekhin assigned the task of the WMS delivery into the OSG release 
      * site characterization - autiomation; human input inevitable anyway; boilerplate 
      * MPI policy going forward 
      * future plans - resource allocation system design; 

---++ November 2007

   * Helped a new team member (Jose Caballero) with initial consultations etc 
   * Started contacts with EGEE on the subject of pilot interoperability 

---++ February 2008
   * Planning for the Annual OSG User Meeting under way 
   * Finalized the content and format of the Bio-session at All-Hands (with Mats and others) 
   * Participation in the OSG Blueprint Workshop at FNAL: 
      * Panda and glideinWMS recognized as de facto Workload Management Systems that are to co-exist undet the OSG umbrells 
      * Discussion of the "job footprint concept as a part of a larger storage resource management for grid jobs 
      * Useful discussion of the "pilot role" (i.e. a specialized VOMS annotaion) and pilot accounts associated with such 
   * Ran a complete and successful test of glExec-enabled pilot job in Panda 

---++ March 2008
   * Participation in the OSG All-Hands Meeting in Chapel Hill 
      * co-coordinated the Bio Sciences session of the Meeting 
   * Dates and initial programme for the Annual OSG User (F2F) Meeting finalized (June 16th-17th) based on recommendations of User Support and EB 
      * Initial list of prospective participans compiled, first announcement sent out
