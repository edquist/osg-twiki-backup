---++ August 2007
   * Study of the Condor system

      * Made suggestions to Igor regarding the robustness of the installation script 
      * first tests run successfully, need to adjust the glidein factory 
   * Participation in the OSG User Support meetings (ongoing) 

---++ September 2007
   * Successful test of the Panda Pilot submission via the glideinWMS mechanism 
   * Identified issues related to that approach: 
      * idling glideins occupy batch slots (unacceptable) 
      * poor scalability of GCB at this point (vulnerability!) 
      * non-scalability of Condor-G mitigated by effective throttling of glidein submission in the glideinWMS system, however underlying issues are not resolved 
   * Investigating the application of the sha1sum checksum mechanism to Panda security 
   * Work with Mats Rynge on the MPI implementation on various Grid sites 
      * complex subject, highlights in recent (10 Aug.) paper by Mats and others. Issues: 
         * loss of the cluster-specific, dynamic MPI environment during the submission of Globus jobs 
         * lack of standards in the interconnect versions, compilers and libraries location 
      * CHARMM project migration to MPI (wanted to implement SMP first, then MPI) 
         * identified Purdue as the best candidate site for deployment
