---+2007
---++ August 2007
   * Study of the Condor system 
   * Evaluation of the pilot glidein (with Barnett) 
   * Setting up a testbed for the evaluation of WMS 
      * Installed components: Apache server, PostgreSQL, RRD Tool 
      * certificates issue resolved 
      * Made suggestions to Igor regarding the robustness of the installation script 
      * first tests run successfully, need to adjust the glidein factory 
   * Participation in the OSG User Support meetings (ongoing) 

---++ September 2007
   * Successful test of the Panda Pilot submission via the glideinWMS mechanism 
   * Identified issues related to that approach: 
      * idling glideins occupy batch slots (unacceptable) 
      * poor scalability of GCB at this point (vulnerability!) 
      * non-scalability of Condor-G mitigated by effective throttling of glidein submission in the glideinWMS system, however underlying issues are not resolved 
   * Investigating the application of the sha1sum checksum mechanism to Panda security 
   * Work with Mats Rynge on the MPI implementation on various Grid sites 
      * complex subject, highlights in recent (10 Aug.) paper by Mats and others. Issues: 
         * loss of the cluster-specific, dynamic MPI environment during the submission of Globus jobs 
         * lack of standards in the interconnect versions, compilers and libraries location 
      * CHARMM project migration to MPI (wanted to implement SMP first, then MPI) 
         * identified Purdue as the best candidate site for deployment 
         * Preston Smith at Purdue contacted, both SMP and MPI approaches should be available at that site 
         * planning initial testing at Purdue 

---++ October 2007
   * Facilitation of the CHARMM MPI deployment at Purdue 
   * Site characterization (discussions with Preston, Mats, Gabriele -- CEMon/GIP) 
   * Presentation at the DDM/Panda workshop regarding our evaluation of the glideinWMS 
   * review of the Pilot Factory code 
   * Participation in the OSG Trash/Blueprint Workshop at FNAL: 
      * WMS roadmap - adoption of glideinWMS vs Panda; need interaction with site admins to determine pros and cons of each 
      * M.Potekhin assigned the task of the WMS delivery into the OSG release 
      * site characterization - autiomation; human input inevitable anyway; boilerplate 
      * MPI policy going forward 
      * future plans - resource allocation system design; 

---++ November 2007
   * Participated in the "Panda performance and reliability" planning exercise with RACF 
   * Finalized Statement of Work (OSG/BNL) 
   * Started planning for the All-Hands Meeting as a part of User Support activity 
   * Created a Work Plan for R.Popescu 
   * Started pilot submission to MPI queue at Purdue, issues identified 

---++ December 2007
   * Commenced testing of the local glExec installation at BNL 
   * Worked out refinements regarding pilot submission accounts and VOMS annotations 
   * Proposed changes to GLUE schema for site characterization 
   * Continued All-Hands Meeting preparations, in particular the Bio-session
