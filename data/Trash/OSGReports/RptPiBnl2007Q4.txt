Workload Management System Extensions: The PanDA WMS system continued as a supported WMS service for OSG with reports of good results from the user community.  The CHARMM biology team, having previously used PanDA to successfully run their jobs, has now modified their application to make use of MPI (parallel computing architecture) capabilities of existing OSG sites. Changes have been made in PanDA configuration to reflect that, and testing of CHARMM/MPI is under way.

The primary deliverable of the first phase of the OSG just-in-time WMS integration, the Pilot Factory, is now in final stages of testing and preparation for inclusion into OSG 1.0.

Security and Authorization: Running a Workload Management System based on pilots presents certain security and authorization challenges. The pilots are typically submitted from accounts with special privileges, sometimes called &#8220;production accounts&#8221;. In the currently deployed version of the PanDA WMS, the UID attached to the payload process will also correspond to such production account, and not the identity of the user who actually requested the execution of this payload. The pilot job code has been updated to take advantage of glexec functionality, which will allow for the payload job to be attributed to the actual user. This adds another layer of access control on the Virtual Organization level. In addition, functionality has been added to PanDA server which allows the system administrators to quickly disable individual users&#8217; access to PanDA while investigating a potential security incident.

Grid Certificate Management for Sites: The OSG Privilege group, DOEGrids, and BNL have identified a need for an automated system to manage the request and renewal of host grid certificates. In order to serve this need, BNL has developed a package (Certify) that uses the DOEgrids Grid Administrator interface to programmatically handle certificate transactions, and has the ability to track grid cert status across all site hosts. The design was the result of numerous conference calls with OSG and DOEgrids security personnel. BNL is now managing their site with it, and will soon contribute it to OSG for inclusion in the VDT. Certify is a utility that can be run to check hundreds of hosts, and instantly renew their host certificates if needed, placing the updated cert in /etc/grid-security. Once we accumulate more experience in using it to manage BNL's certificates, we'll ready it for inclusion into VDT.
