<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

Work at LBNL contributes to the areas of Integration, Storage and Security.

---+++ Integration
Jeff Porter is a member of the Trash/Trash/Integration team and carried out the
work described below.
---++++ NERSC VTB site
Managed and updated security configuration of the VTB cluster.
Deployed a GUMS server for use by the LBNL_VTB site.
Configured SRM/BestMan installation and startup as well as updates
for new GUMS server, and adjusted shared storage.
---++++ VTB and ITB activities
Made some updates to the SGE job manager for GT2 and GT4 (WS-GRAM) and
tested on NERSC resources before forwarding updated software to VDT.

Set up the ITB_0.7 site validation table and identified participating sites for this release,
and developed some of the validation procedures.

Participated in the ITB installation fest.
Carried out multiple VTB:ce and ITB:ce installs and reported issues/results
back to the Trash/Trash/Integration group.  Carried out several targeted tests for
   * confirmed problem and suggested solution to NFS-based WS-GRAM installation
   * firewall issues on OSG client and documented results
   * VTB:Client installations
   * provided feedback to new RSV configurations 
   * ITB 0.7 Client install and of test of Condor-G configuration
Updated the WS-GRAM validation procedures and documented issues of WS-GRAM
with Condor-G.  Maintained the LBNL_VTB validation table results for ITB_0.7.
Updated documentation.

Jeff Porter has regular participation in weekly VTB and ITB meetings, as well as local NERSC grid
meetings.  Attended OSG Users meeting at Fermilab.


---+++ Storage
Alex Sim participates in the OSG Storage group and carried out
the work described below.

---++++ SRM Tester framework
Carried out maintenance and bug fixes of the periodic testing, with results of the testing
published at http://datagrid.lbl.gov/.

Some stress testing of all participating SRM V2.2 servers was carried out manually.

---++++ SRM Support
Set up and ran periodic (hourly) testing of the STAR analysis scenario use of !BestMan.
This consists of submitting 100 jobs that copy files via !BestMan servers.  It validated the
robustness and stability of the new version of !Bestman before deployment in the OSG 0.8 release.

---+++ Security

Doug Olson is a member of the OSG security group and carried out the
work described below.

---++++ OSG RA
The OSG RA Agents processed 600 certificate requests in this period, 486 certificates were issued directly via the privileged interface for host/service certificates, and 100 personal certificates via the self-service replacement interface.

The DOEGrids CA is planning an internal audit to be performed in December 2007 with a report to be presented to the !EUGridPMA. In this period we had some initial planning and discussions of the participation of the OSG RA in this audit.

As a continuation of the planning for managing large numbers of host certificates started in the previous period, there were discussions about a process to issue certificates using the existing Grid Admin interface of the CA. An outline of this process and workflow diagram is shown at Security.BulkHostCertsNoPIN. Effort at BNL are considering developing scripts for this type of process which could be contributed to OSG for use at other sites.

---++++ CA needs for LIGO
The detailed deliverables for the LIGO adjustments to the DOEGrids CA were completed with the deployment of the DOEGrids CA running at upgraded version of the Redhat Certificate System (7.1) on July 5. In addition to some changes of the CA software and configuration, carried out by ESnet staff, there were some changes to the [[ReleaseDocumentation.CertScriptsPackage][certificate scripts]] package coordinated with the CA software update. A few follow-up items (handling of certificate renewal notifications) was handled following the software upgrade and were completed in September.

---++++ Security group activities
Under the coordination of Mine Altunay we started the annual Test and Evaluation of the Security Controls defined in the OSG Cyber Security Plan, for the OSG Core services. In addition to providing information about the OSG RA core service, I assist Mine with the collection and evaluation of the results of this process. It is anticipated that this annual Test and Evaluation will be complete by December.

I contributed to the discussion and evaluation of the vulnerabilities and security incidents in this period. I prepared a summary of the OSG response to vulnerabilities that was included in the OSG Metrics Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment for Year 1 (OSG Doc. 541), in September.

I contributed to review and updates of the policy documents being developed for OSG and the JSPG. The status of these documents is maintained at Security.PolicyandProcedureTable.
