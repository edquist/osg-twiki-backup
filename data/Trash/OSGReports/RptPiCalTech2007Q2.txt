<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

Caltech started the quarter searching for replacements for both (all) staff working at Caltech on Trash/Integration Testbed and Applications Development. The Applications Developers was hired in late April and has been able to learn how to submit and track LIGO binrary inspiral workflows on the OSG. The Trash/Integration Testbed Developer was hired in June and has begun learning the infrastructure surrounding the OSG ITB cluster here at Caltech, improving overall security and reviewing how to more efficiently use the available resources.

Work continued with the Pegasus developers to make improvements to the workflow generation and management. One area addressed was to add support for dynamic cleanup of LIGO data after it had fallen out of the scope of the workflow. This did not prove as useful as hope due to a late reuse of nearly all LIGO data in follow on steps of the binary inspiral analysis. Although other workflows outside of LIGO did see significant improvement in the efficiency of disk space utilization with this new feature. There are some efforts forming to implement automated workflow rearrangements to better support dynamic cleanup, but nothing as concrete as an implementation yet.

In early June an issue with the dynamic creation of directories was suddenly discovered on many OSG sites. This has been pushed up to the troubleshooting team and the condor developers. It is not known at this time what has suddenly brought this problem into scope for the LIGO workflows, although there have been some suggestions that it could be related to recent changes to GLOBUS. This has taken up a significant amount of our efforts over the past few weeks.

Also began work on measuring the scaling relationships of the LIGO workflows as they relate to the amount of input LIGO data involved. This is in preparation for being able to run LIGO binary inspiral workflow simulations on the OSG to supplement LIGO's internal simulation statistics for efficiency calculations.
