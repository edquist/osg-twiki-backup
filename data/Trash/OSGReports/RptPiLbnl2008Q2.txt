---+++ Security Area

*OSG RA*

There were 598 personal certificates issued in Q2-08 with 320 being issued via the self service replacement interface. There were 1964 host/service certificates issued with the majority (1728) being issued via the gridadmin interface. As usual, some effort went towards user support issues with certificates and requests.

A tracking system used to monitor the status of certificate requests processed by OSG RA Agents was moved from some old hardware being decommisioned (www.ppdg.net) to a virtual host on some other producton hardware (roundup.doegrids.org).

At the TAGPMA meeting at the Oakland NERSC facility there was additional discussion of the OSG ID vetting procedures. It was agreed that the term "trusted agent" was the best descriptive term.

Some of these requirements will lead to some changes in the OSG methods and record keeping, primarily about how the Trusted Agent (or Sponsor) is identified.

Attended weekly security operations meeting and participated in policy, security planning and incident issues.

*ISGC2008*

I attended the International Symposium on Grid Computing in Taiwan (http://event.twgrid.org/isgc2008) which was hosted by Academia Scinica Grid Computing. I gave three presentations on aspects of OSG as well as a poster. These materials are posted in the Doc DB ( 746, 747, 748, 749).

I also attended the !APGridPMA meeting held adjacent to the conference and presented the materials mentioned above about the ID vetting methods used by OSG.
