===========
week 1 & 2
===========
-  Support - Inherited the VDT-dCache ticket handling responsibility from Ted. Created tickets with GOC and followed up on them.
-  Testing - Finished first version of load-tests package and started transfers between UCSD and Gridworks/FNAL. 
 Performing cleanup of data. Request feature addition in to SRMWatch monitoring tool for third-party transfers.
 Performed couple of single node dCache installs using vdt-dcache-1.2.4 tarball.
========
week 3
========
-  Support - Maintained tickets with GOC and followed up on them. Refer to minutes of OSG-Storage meetings for details.
 Helped Robert Illingworth with authentication issues on ITB SE with Ted's help. It is now working for him.
 Requested account on dCache ticketing system.
-  Testing - Upgraded dCache on Gridworks cluster to 1.8.0-21
 Upgraded dCache on ITB SE to 1.7.0-46
 Performed one way load tests from Gridworks->UCSD. Number of transfers per hour were ~3400
 Load tests were started. Files were being transferred from UCSD->Gridworks. However, after 30 min 
 of successful transfers, failures started happening. Troubleshooting in progress.

VDT/dCache
<verbatim>
   * Loadtests - Installed pacman, osg-wn-0.6.0, jdk1.5, latest srmclient on 10 fapl nodes. These nodes will serve as 
    client nodes for performing third-party transfers between gridworks and UCSD.
   * Gridworks cluster    - enabled gPlazma and setup Tanya's account on it. This is pointing to FermiGrid GUMS server.
   * FNAL_FAPL_ITB_SE   - srm and pool node went down. So setup the ITB SE from scratch.
   * Discovered issues with dCache server rpm version 1.7 patch level 42 and postgres installation. 
     To summarize, with this dcache server rpm, postgres does not start by itself and also the client authorization 
     file has different way of authorizing various hosts (unlike in prior releases of dcache server rpm where all is set to trust)
     I have developed a workaround for this and I and Gregory Sharp have tested that it works.
  
     Support ticket has been filed with DESY and Owen Synge is looking in to the issue.
     Waiting on his reply.</verbatim>

GIN

   * Presented OSG-PRAGMA Interoperability talk at PRAGMA13 workshop- Sept 23-25'2007 at NCSA-UIUC

   * Support/Testing of FNAL_FAPL_ITB_SE
   * Investigating various billing features/functionality and working on Billing Test Plan

</verbatim>
---++ Period: July 2007
VDT/dCache
<verbatim>
   * Fixed a bug in postgres installation script as reported by Gregory Sharp 
   * Working on another postgres feature for next release
   * Learning about Replica Manager - purpose, configuration.
   * dCache-gPlazma testing
- Did one round of testing on test setup
- Updated documentation
- Did another round of testing on production setup. 2 issues were noticed- missing grid-vorolemap file and 3 grid ftp doors not accepting grid credentials. 
These have been taken care of and gPlazma is now running.
   * Last week I reported that I have been learning about Replica Manager - purpose, configuration.
- No longer working on this. Instead I have been assigned to develop a testing plan for "Billing". 
   * Helped Sergio at SPRACE with issue of pool info not showing up for certain files
   * Gave Tanya root access on fapl nodes and discussed configuration of fapl cluster with her
   * Completed first draft of the billing test plan.
   *  Made further additions to Billing Test Plan as suggested by Ted.

VDT/dCache
<verbatim>      
   * A software vulnerability was reported with regard to default PNFS configuration which allows users to mount pnfs on any host and read/write data. 
This behavior was  unexpected, as according to configuration permission are set to "30" which means disabled i/o. DESY confirmed that this is not 
really a security issue and infact this configuration is useful for several setups. Anyways on Ted's suggestion, I modified the pnfs install script to not allow this. 
   * Also, added some functionality to pnfs install script  to detect existing postgres databases/users.
   * Updated the documentation
   * Support 

SPRACE - Needed help adding a new pool - Done
		Needed scripts to syncronize the pnfs and postgres db files - Done
Caltech - Email support. Will upgrade dCache next week. I will be their support person.
   * Transfers between UCSD and FAPL - Still failing. Meeting Yujun next week to discuss further.
   * While testing dual login authorizations via gPlazma (deployed on stkendca3a.),  came across authorization errors (details sent in previous emails)
   * As asked by Eileen, need to document the testing process -this afternoon or possibly next week
   * Support 

SPRACE - Needed help enabling dCap - Done
Caltech - Provided support for their dCache upgrade. Several issues were resolved. Upgrade was reported successful.
   * gPlazma-dCache testing
Testing on old setup continued. Confirmed that in dCache 1.7, gPlazma falls back to dcache.kpwd for multiple login authorizations. New setup not complete for me to test.
Alpha version of documentation on testing gPlazma-dCache setup complete
   * Packaging the postgres rpms for SL3 SL4 32 and 64 bit
</verbatim>
---++ Period: May 2007
VDT/dCache
<verbatim>      
   * Worked on several helpdesk tickets related to use of VDT-dCache package such as gridftp transfer failure after enabling checksums, pnfs upgrade failures, clarification 
on color-coded disk space usage on pool nodes etc.
   * Modified gPlazma configuration on fapl034 and registered FAPL test stand with the monitoring tool developed by Alex Sim at LBL
http://datagrid.lbl.gov/v11/ 
   * Resolved failures in test data transfers (reason was disk on pool nodes being full). After solving this issue, more failures have been detected and are related to gridftp 
door problem on ucsd storage element. Work in process. 
   * Made minor updates in pnfs upgrade documentation
   * Most of time spent in providing support to various VDT-dCache package users. Lot of email correspondence. Some of the issues still unresolved are gridftp transfer failure 
after enabling checksums, pnfs upgrade failures, failed srmcp transfers on SPRACE SE, failed srmcp based transfers at Michigan OSG SE etc. 
   * Several tests revealed that only third party transfers between FAPL and UCSD are failing.  Transfers from local filesystem to either of these filesystems are successful. It is in 
initial impression that failures are caused by a bad gridftp door, but question still remains as to why all my transfers are going through same gridftp door (which is bad).
   * Added documentation to README file
   * Modified pnfs installation script to not create pnfsserver user, if one already exists.
   * Spent some time trying to fix 4 fapl nodes. I am still  not able to log into 3 of these.
   * Attended ~ 2 hours meeting in which Timur described the space reservation functionality
   * One issue that I am currently working on is pnfs upgrade at SPRACE. 
   * Transfers between UCSD and FAPL still failing. One transfer did success 2 days ago. Frank and myself are corresponding on this. Frank mentioned Yujun was able to transfer 
files from FNAL to UCSD, so will meet Yujun today to discuss.
  * Significant time spent in providing support to SPRACE. Looks like SPRACE updated their postgres and forgot to backup the original data. Had other issues while starting 
various doors/pnfs and failed srmcp transfers.
   * Finished the testing of gPlazma deployed on stkendca3a

---++ Period: April 2007
VDT/dCache
<verbatim>      
   * Investigated about SRM Tester packages developed by Alex Sim and John Rosheck and linking their test results from the VORS webpage. Currently, VORS lists various SEs 
and static information associated with them 
   * Noticed that dCache setup on fapl was not functional, so I had to install/setup dCache on 5 fapl nodes again.
   * Finished script that performs third-party data transfers between UCSD and FAPL, and does the cleanup. Script is replicated for 3 different submit machines.
   * Data (files of size - 126MB(small) and 2GB(large) is being transferred since yesterday (04/12/07)
   * 04/13- Ted mentioned that dcache server software needs to updated to 1.7.0-31 (current version is 1.7.0-24). So, before performing any further data transfers, I will be 
upgrading dcache on this test stand early next week. Also, will be learning about space reservation function. 
   * Upgraded the dcache-server installation on fapl034, 037, 038, 039, 040
from 1.7.0-24 to 1.7.0-34. Started data transfers.
