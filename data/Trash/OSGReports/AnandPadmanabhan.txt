   * 1.1.4.1.2 Test & deploy troubleshooting utilities

---++ Period: September 2007
   * Completed work with Jing on Discovering and Troubleshooting OSG Sites.
      * Her application (based on R) runs successfully on a large number of OSG sites.
      * GOC tickets resolved.
      * Guided Jing with best practices of using OSG storage.
      * Communicated with swift developers to resolve issues.
   * Helped resolve production issues with OSG information services.
      * Patches to GIP is planned for VDT 1.8.1
   * Helped the GOC to resolve BDII issues on their ITB environment.
      * Identified and provided solution to fix this issue.
      * The ITB BDII was publishing stale information since bdii-update was not running.
      * Worked with GOC to come up with a plan to prevent re-occurrence.
   * Attended OSG Troubleshooting, Integration, Operation and VDT office Hours 
---++ Period: August 2007
   * LIGO workflow problem: Using the intrumentation in  the jobManager code Condor team confirmed that the problem was occurring due to a race condition between Condor-G !GridManager and Globus. A patch was developed by both Globus and Condor team, for their respective code. I then proposed a test suites, that would properly evaluate the solution. The suite not only evaluated the correctness of the patches, but also evaluated the performance of the Condor-G patch individually so as to provide ligo with a temporary workaround on the submit side. We also tested both the patches together and recommended the solution to be included in OSG 0.8.0.  Details: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/LigoMkdir]]
   * Worked with Parag, Jaime, Charles and Micheal to resolve a communication issue between Condor-G and Globus reported by D0. The problem was traced to Condor !Documentation/Release3.GridMonitor using the perl libraries (XML:Parser) from the system, rather than the OSG directory. Since Condor-G did not have a easy way of using OSG perl libraries, current we asked the sites to install XML:Parser in their system perl. Details: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/GlobusCondorGJobStatus]]
   * Work with Jing from OSG VO  on the Discovering and Troubleshooting OSG Sites' Problems through User-Level Tests. Opened few tickets with GOC to allow access to OSG VO at various sites.

      * Firewall issue reported by user support was resolved. Details: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/FirewallIssue]]
      * LIGO workflow problem. It appears that the stdout is getting transfered twice thereby getting a 0B output file. I prepared a site to test the problem as well as implement and test and solutions on. I also added instrumentation to the jobManager code to get detailed logs. Details: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/LigoMkdir]]
      * Debugging issue relating to communication between Globus and CondorG. Worked with mainly Parag, Michael and Jaime on this issue. Details: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/GlobusCondorGJobStatus]]

      * Helped USCMS - T3 site admin at uscms1.fltech-grid3.fit.edu. He has problems with CE gatekeeper and gsiftp issues.
      * LIGO WFs failing. Problem was traced to a missing/overwritten stdout. Condor ticket #15710 opened.
      * Worked on firewall issue reported by user support group
   * Developed a userlevel troubleshooting tool, that is intended to facilitate self troubleshooting. This tool is in alpha stage and available at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Troubleshooting/AutomationTool]]
   * Attended OSG Troubleshooting, Integration, OSG Storage and VDT office Hours
---++ Period: May 2007
   * Continued to help DZero VO with the reprocessing runs, troubleshooting problems as and when they occur. The runs have become much more stable, with a high number of events per day being processed on OSG.  
   * Worked on a number of problems reported through the campaign.
      * LIGO user having problem running job on one sub-cluster of FNAL_FERMIGRID1
   * Wayne finally figured out that the problem was with STAR BNL as resulting due to a bug in xinit.d the comes with RedHat Enterprise 3 and 4, that potentially caused the race condition. This problem was only noticed when connections were made across a cisco firewall
   * Attended OSG Troubleshooting, Integration, and VDT office Hours
---++ Period: April 2007
   * Worked with a number of OSG sites to get Dzero reprocessing jobs. Most time spent with troubleshooting and debugging specific problems on individual sites.
