Globus bug 4981, but hadn't been fully resolved.  A new
gridmonitor.sh provided by Jaime Frey has cleared the issue up, as
tested by Steven Timm.  The troubleshooting team also reorganized
their documentation into split internal/external portions for easier

was resolved with a patch to the Globus jobmanger and the Condor-G

	technicians, engineers, and the drilling crew. These people are
	located both on- and off the ice (at their home institutions),
	working together to acquire, interpret, and visualize the data
	measured on the recovered cores. These participants are primarily
	located in the U.S., New Zealand, Italy, and Germany, but
	scientists, students and educators in other countries are also
	interested in participating in this research and helping us to
	unravel the stories preserved by the rocks about the evolution of

hours) at the SC&#8217;07 conference in Nov to introduce Grid computing
