There was a significant ramp-up of activity by the OSG group at the University of the Witwatersrand ('Wits') during this period.  In early August, three students (Martin Cook, Norman Ives and Claire Lee) from Wits participated in the OSG Great Plains Grid School in Lincoln, NE.  Two of the students (Cook and Ives) are also site administrators/developers for the Wits OSG cluster, and worked closely with OSG staff to gain experience in installing and running Grid software.  Jobs were run on local and remote sites, using Condor, PBS and RLS, along with the DAGman and Swift scheduling tools.  The students subsequently spent several days at the University of Chicago Computation Institute, working with Ben Clifford, Mike Wilde, Alina Bejan and others.  OSG CE software was installed and two sites configured on the students' laptops (access to Wits was not available at this time), and a Condor pool set up.  Cook and Ives succeeded in submitting jobs to and from these sites via a variety of mechanisms.  Lee was able to submit jobs to analyze JLab experiment data using the Swift scheduling tool.  The three students also spend time at Fermilab, visiting the CMS Tier-1 facility and meeting with OSG Executive Director Ruth Pordes.  The final part of their visit was spent at BNL, where the students met with ATLAS physicists, and were introduced to the ATLAS Athena package and the process of submitting ATLAS simulation and analysis jobs.  It is anticipated that Wits will collaborate with BNL in future ATLAS activities (see http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/bulletin/2007/bb083107.pdf).

Following their visit to the US, the students have since been able to submit Grid jobs from South Africa, including Wits bio-informatics and photon scattering applications.  At this initial stage, jobs were run using Swift and low-level Globus commands.  This milestone was achieved in late September.  Also during September, administrative difficulties with access to/from Wits were finally resolved and all ports opened, and funding from OSG via Columbia was finally authorized.  This will allow rapid progress on the hardware build-up of the Wits cluster, and it is expected that a head node and several compute nodes will be purchased in the coming weeks.  

The Wits group has developed an initial suite of target applications that they foresee running on the Grid in the next several months.  Initial applications will include jobs from the Wits bio-informatics group (Hazelhurst), GEANT simulations of JLab detectors, and a paleotomography application (Connell).  Subsequently, applications including ATLAS studies (Lee), a mineral-PET project for mining (Ballestrero), nuclear reactor simulations, and a number of nuclear physics topics are planned.
