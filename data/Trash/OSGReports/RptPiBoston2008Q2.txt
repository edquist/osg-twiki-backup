Quarterly report for Apr-Jun 2008: Boston University

  During the quarter, Pacman-related work was done in the following areas:

a) Adding platform support for Fedora 8, Ubuntu 8 and IFIC-SL.

b) Adding cache-level user controllable error messages so that users will receive VDT and/or OSG controllable messages when packages fail to install or fail to update.

c) Adding individual package controllable error messages allowing authors of the VDT and OSG caches to give package-specific instructions triggered on failure to install or failure to update correctly.

d) Encorporating several speedups gotten from code contributed by Alain Roy (Pacman 3.25 release).

e) Fixing problems with the freedisk atom, with wget and with perl version detection and fixed problems with pacman commands on installations where users do not have write-access.

f) Improving pacballs so as to minimize dependencies and improve their usefullness as archives.

This work was made available via releases 3.25 and 3.26 following the usual pre-release multi-OS (typically 18 different OSes) testing. We continued our usual level of providing help to Pacman users who need it. The use of Pacman continues to be high in the OSG community and elsewhre. There were 390,000 downloads of Pacman software from physics.bu.edu and at least 470,000 new Pacman installations created worldwide during this quarter.

   A major achievement of the quarter was to complete the work of the Oct. 2007 SOW and complete the requests from the VDT team in time for the OSG 1.0 release.
