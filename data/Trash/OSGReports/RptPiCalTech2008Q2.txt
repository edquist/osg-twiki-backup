---++++ Application Support and Workflow Extensions:

Significant progress has been made in improving the Pegasus workflow planner system in areas which impact LIGO's binary inspiral workflow analysis. In addition, changes have been made to the underlying binary inspiral workflow engines to work better with Pegasus. It is now possible to submit binary inspiral workflows to either the LIGO Data Grid or the Open Science Grid, using the same abstract DAX as the seed.

The Pegasus workflow planner is now able to manage the movement of its own executable, instead of requiring them to be previously installed on sites. This greatly inproved the turnaround time for testing new feature sets and enhancements to workflow planning without having to wait for the next release of a patched server-side software stack. It also allows using intermediate versions of the workflow tools between release cycles.

The use of the OSG for running the [[mailto:Einstein@Home][Einstein@Home]] periodic source analysis continues to increase as improvements are made to the grid-submission engines for this analysis and as more and more OSG sites upgrade to OSG 1.0 with its support for WS-Gram. Grid resources are now the top contributor toward analysis results for [[mailto:Einstein@Home][Einstein@Home]], with the OSG contributing roughly 15% of the total contributions coming from Grids.
---+++ Integration and Validation Testbed Activities:

A replacement for the Integration and Validation Testbed activities work at Caltech has been identified. Currently working through the Caltech hiring infrastructure. The expected start date is October 1st of this year.
---+++ Caltech PI Activities:

Worked with OSG Project Manager and OSG Council Co-Chair to provide LIGO inputs for the annual report to the NSF
---+++ LIGO VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Manager Activities:

Jeff Minelli of Penn State University will be stepping out of his role as the principal contact for the LIGO VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's support center, site admin and security related contact currently working with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration Computer Committee to identify a replacement.
---+++ OSG Council co-Chair Activities:

Organized and held monthly telecon meetings of the OSG Council. Agendas and Minutes for the meetings are available on the OSG Council web site.

Organized a sub-committee of the OSG Council to review the "At Large" VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Representation". This sub-committee is now chaired by Shaowen Wang of UIUC. The sub-committee met typically one or two times a month and invited representatives from VOs that do not currently have a seat on the Council to hear their views and impressions of the Council organization.

Participated in the organization the face-to-face Council Meeting to be held on August 5th, 2008 at the Westin Hotel
