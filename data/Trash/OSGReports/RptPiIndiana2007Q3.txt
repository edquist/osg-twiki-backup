---+++ Key Accomplishments

   * Resource and Service Validation Project developed and ready for 0.8.0 release. The operations group led an effort to change the way OSG resources are monitored. By developing an infrastructure and pluggable metric probes, the GOC hopes to bring the resources admins the ability to monitor and determine problems locally on the resource. By using the Grid Monitoring Working Group specifications, this allows us to exchange resource information with WLCG partners. Probes are pluggable and can be developed by any contributor and placed in the infrastructure. An upcoming second version will add new probes, address proxy concerns, offer an cleaner web interface to collected data, and target SE and other grid services.

   * Developed Schema for OSG Information Management Project. Database is being created and populated during Q4. The OIM will be the definitive source of information for OSG monitoring, accounting, information services, and other OSG services.
