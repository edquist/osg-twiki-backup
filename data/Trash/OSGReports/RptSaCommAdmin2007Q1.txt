---++ Administration and Communication Q1 2007 Quarterly Report
Ruth Pordes, V1.0

---+++ Key accomplishments
----++++ Project Management:
Coordinated the presentations and documentation for the first meeting of the Joint Oversight Team (JOT) meeting in Washington on 20th February.

Coordinated and published the OSG six month report and sent to the JOT in time for the next round of funding to the DOE Labs. 

Kent Blackburn as Resources co-Manager reviewed and helped move the Statements of Work through the signature process. 

Chander Sehgal started as the OSG Project Associate in January. He has taken responsibility for coordinating the FY?07 SOWs, the financial reporting and planning,  the OSG WBS and reports, working with Kent and Paul as the resources co-managers. 

Chander is also contributing to the development of an increasing number of OSG Policies and Agreements. He is now the manager of the OSG Virtual Organization, which will become a template for the policies, agreements and business process responsibilities of VOs using the OSG. Chander will also provide some oversight of the metrics deliverables of the project.

Sent the first 2 metrics to the JOT:
   1 Operations Ticket Metrics
   1 Capacity of the OSG. 

Coordinated 2 Blueprint meetings in February. Ran Executive Team meetings weekly; and Executive Board meetings in January. 

Helped with  project plans for Site Validation, LIGO CA and security deliverables; work with D0 and Engagement to facilitate their production running on OSG.  

Contributed to joint CI days organization with TeraGrid, Internet2, Educause, OSG. 

----++++ Administration and Organization
The OSG Consortium/All Hands meeting was held from March 5-7th, co-located with a joint US LHC-OSG Tier-3 workshop, and the US LHC Tier-2 meetings. Overall there were more than 130 attendees. 

----++++ Communications and Documentation:
OSG News has been written and distributed for Jan, Feb, Mar.
 
Anne Heavey, the OSG Communicator, holds weekly Documentation Project meetings and, as the OSG contributing editor, regularly meets with the International Science Grid this week team.

Three research briefs have been written and posted on the OSG web portal:
   * The CMS "Top 100": Physicists with CMS run millions of simulations in order to pick out the precious few that may lead to discovery.
   * Geneticists' Gateway to the Grid: Grid computing is helping microbiologists solve the mysteries of mapping new genomes using GADU.
   * CDF In Search of the Subtle and Rare: Scientists seeking to discover ever-rarer particles and processes need ever-greater amounts of data.
Probing the Perfect Liquid with the STAR Grid:?Experimenters are attempting to reproduce liquid matter in the universe microseconds after the Big Bang. 

Most of the Statements of Work were completed and signed off. 

---+++ Major Milestones completed

| WBS	| Agency_Milestone| 	Name| 	%Complete|

---+++ Activity progress

Administration & Communication
Create & Maintain OSG Project Plan -  Year 1 project plan completed and baselined. and being used as reference for tracking progress.


Document Change Control -  completed, posted in the Document Repository and used for changes to Iowa work plans.

Provide OSG communications -  Anne Heavey on board and providing ongoing coordination and deliverables to the OSG comnunications, OSG web information and documentation. .

Write  Quarterly Financial Reports - Chander has taken over responsibility for these and is writing them as planned. (who are we distributing them to?)




---+++ Concerns and Issues being Worked
We have effort shortfalls in key areas that are affecting the milestones and deliverables of the overall project. Staff transition needs to be planned for. This is increasing the burden on other OSG staff and non-OSG funded effort at a few institutions. 

Deliverables to the Office of Science and Engineering ?International Collaboration  are delayed due to a lack of available energy and effort. This needs increased attention and effort in the next quarter.
