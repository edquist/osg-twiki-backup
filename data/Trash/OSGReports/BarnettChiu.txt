---+++ Task Description
   * Visited Condor research team for the first time and studied and investigated how some of the Condor internal works and 
      how Condor system can be applied to address scalablity issues faced by current Pilot scheme(s). 
   * Tested Condor-G, Condor glidein mechanims within ATLAS sites. 

---+++ Notes

---++++ General Tasks 
   * Investigated and test various Condor daemons and Condor system as a whole and study how they can integrate with    
      Panda system employed by ATLAS. 

---++++ Supportive Study
   * More familarity with Python and Linux in generral

   1. The initial _PilotFactory_ proposal is located    
       [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/AtlasSoftware/PilotFactoryPlan][here]].
   1. Descriptions on _schedd-based glidein_ is [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/AtlasSoftware/ScheddGlidein][here]].   
   
   Note that these pages above are subject to frequent updates.  

---+++ Task Description

   * Proposal for _PilotFactory_ implementation. 
   * Proposal for _schedd-based_ glidein targeted to increase Pilot submission rate.
   * Proposal for a new Pilot scheme, combining current Pilot with Condor     
     [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.8/3_1Introduction.html][startd]]; the new Pilot scheme is targeted for 
     increasing Pilot execution. 
   * OSG Work Load Management meeting at UTA. 

---+++ Notes

---++++ Supportive Study
   * More familiarity with Perl, shell scripts, XML, web Technologies, and Linux in general.

---+++ Task Description 

   * Implemented and tested _schedd-based glidein_ mechanism within ATLAS sites. 
      * Sample [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~pleiades/][schedd-related binaries]] are available on the server at University of 
         Wisconsin at Madison; note that these binaries are currently for temporary use and therefore are subject to updates. 
   * Configured _glidein_ tarball server for the use within ATLAS sites.
