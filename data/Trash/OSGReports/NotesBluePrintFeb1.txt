---+ Notes from Trash/Trash/Blueprint Meeting, Feb 1, 2007
%TOC%

---++ Storage technologies
   * Discussion of what OSG is offerring as a storage element.
   * dCache SRM resources:
      * http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html
   * [[http://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu/][xrootd]] discussion - ATLAS is considering this, STAR and SLAC brining experience for this.  How does it implement an SRM functionality?
   * How will OSG plan to use an SRM/dCache SE?  Trash/Deployment on 15 sites.
   * Miron: we need an open discussion on what we need.
   * Ruth - drawing xrootd stack.
   * root integration with dcache - there is a special class tdcache.
   * xrootd metrics that would be hard to beat - due to its namespace architecture, eg., number files to open /time.   block access is desired.
   * How do they compare in terms of:
      * local network faults?
      * hot spots
      * server faults
      * faults in a file  
      * congestion
   * Ruth: we need to worry about _capabilities_ not the technology, and the needs of current and future stakeholders.
   * Then applications must be capable of discovering which protocol to use, given a logical file name.
   * Timor: glite knows how to open files in any of these types of protocols, e.g.: xrootd, dpm, dcache, etc.
   * Miron: we need tools and libraries to help smaller VOs to access these protocols.
   * Issue of supporting two SE's on a site: advertising the resource, how applications connect to them, which CPUs see them, etc.
   * Note - there is at least one stakeholder in OSG that requsts OSG to consider xrootd as a supported storage service included in VDT, and would asked that the executive team would consider its priority and effort available, milestones of stakesholders, for its evaluation. 
   * Next issue: ACLs and opening files, re-using UIDs, and mapping UIDs to GIDs, and identity management issues.  Is the DN a unique key?
      * Long discussion on how the identity mapping
   * Storage capabilities in dCache (Timor)
      * See dcache workshop presentation, https://indico.desy.de/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=138
      * Space reservation - etc.
   * FTS discussion.

---++ Information system technologies
   * BDII as implemented in CMS: http://grow.uiowa.edu/infrastructure/cms/bdii.shtml
