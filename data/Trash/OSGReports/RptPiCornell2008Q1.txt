Greg Sharp (Cornell) effort during Q1 2008
* dCache transfer probe (Gratia): updates based on changes requested by Bockelman, plus further testing/polishing
* updated dynamic storage scripts (WBS 4.4.1) to handle dead pools
* improved error messages in dCache GridFTP server and door code (WBS 4.4.9.1).  Also updated to log4j calls from say/esay
* updated/tested/polished the dCache storage probe (added after initial Y2 SOW ), with most outstanding issues addressed.  The two main remaining items are 1) changes in the SRM schema for the postgres db removed the hsm type field, and Greg has been determining if these can be ignored, 2) if dCache is not running, the probe issues  inappropriate error messages.
* One of the largest efforts centered around the development of the gratia GridFTP probe (WBS 4.4.2.1).  This work required much work with the GLOBUS teem and their Metrics package, and was slowed by the difficulty in debugging the GridFTP to usage-receiver link.  The problems were tracked to a mismatch between the Globus Metrics code and the database schema.  With that repaired in early February, Sharp
 - worked on development of a Gratia probe to extract Globus GridFTP accounting information
 - pushed for the addition of the  DN of the user accessing the GridFTP server to the metrics system, which OSG needs.
   Logging of the DN (and additional support for logging other potentially useful information) was added to the Metrics
  Package in early March. 
- found/reported several bugs concerning the Metrics logging, but in principle it works
Completion of GridFTP probe hit two major roadblocks in March
- Use of the Global Metrics package for logging of the DN requires Globus 4.1.3 to function correctly. The VDT is probably not ready to upgrade to this version of Globus.
- Sharp discovered that the GridFTP server uses unreliable messaging to report accounting to the Metrics server. This was declared unacceptable by OSG management.
* initiated development of scripts for short term reporting for RSV.  The effort slowed somewhat by lack of concrete requirements -- Sharp using his best judgement for this round.
