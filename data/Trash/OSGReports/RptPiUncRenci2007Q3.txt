Engagement Quarterly PI Report: July-September 2007

   * Continued very low level support for the Rosetta community. Continued operations of the Engage VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and involvement in the OSG community to accomplish this. Updated the Engage VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo getting started guide based on experiences with new users. Continued participation in CI-Days workshop efforts.

   * Continued work with Brian Etherton for WRF runs on OSG in support of ongoing research, and leading up to a research highlight by end of CY07.

   * Began working with a text mining researcher that has successfully used OSG to begin mining text from 160,000 journal articles. This work is expected to lead to a publication with an OSG citation in the 6 month time frame, in addition to a research highlight

   * Began working with a Genetics/Neuroscience researcher who has successfully run pilot jobs, but is not yet ready for full scale runs due to algorithm enhancements. The large runs will be done on OSG, and will lead to a publication with an OSG citation within 6 to 8 months, and a research highlight.

   * Activities in various stages of development on the campus grid initiative at: Duke, LSU, U.Buffalo, NCSU. Began documentation of Clemson campus grid as a resource for future activities.

   * Developed a job flow visualizer for demonstration at CHEP 2007. This same application has continued to evolve and will be shown at SC&#8217;07. This 3D Windows application will connect to a socket to consume event notifications from the Engage VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo matchmaker, and graphically display information about: number of jobs running/queued at each resource provider; the Engage resource provider ranking that directs job submissions and is based on recent performance; completed jobs; failed jobs; etc. This application could potentially be made generally available, along with the protocol that VO&#8217;s would need to implement if they wanted to utilize the application. In addition to reading events from a socket for the display of &#8220;real time or live&#8221; status, the application can read events from a file (demo mode).
