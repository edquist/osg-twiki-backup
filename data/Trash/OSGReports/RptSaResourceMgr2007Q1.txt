Presented "OSG Status" report at the Joint Oversight Team review/meeting in Washington, DC.

Gave OSG Resource Managers presentation to OSG Council at OSG Consortium in San Diego

Regularly worked with Project Associate to assess status of statements of work, issues with contracts, language within the Statements of Work and the sub-contracts, expenditures via email and teleconferences.

Worked with OSG Comunications officer to draft a top level "policies and agreements" document and presented this to the OSG Executive Team and sent to OSG Council for thier consideration.

Made good progress on the sign off of statements of work. The primary hurdle still seems to be with the Wisconsin SOW as it is the only one that hasn't made it to the resource managers (other than new ones to be addressed in the second quarter).

Have been working with Executive Director to evaluate and establish new partnerships with Brazilian Grid and Tsinghua University in China.

Drafted summary report on the international partnership sessions held at the OSG Consortium meeting for publication with help from the OSG Communications officers.

Worked with several institutional PIs and the Project Associate to formulate "change requests". Added new process to change request to allow approval to transpire in weekly Executive Team Teleconferences.
