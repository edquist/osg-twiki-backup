Quarterly report for January-March 2008: Boston University

Due to a delay in funding, we had no funding during this quarter.
However, we maintained routine user support of Pacman for OSG and 
worked on the following items:
    
a) Following a comment by Scot Kronenfeld, we improved error 
messages when attempting to remove a package that is depended 
on by other packages in the installation.

b) Improved http error messages and improved the no-http-cache
allow option for use with squids.

c) Fixed a bug introduced in 3.22 which caused a package to
be unremovable if some other package depends on the first package
and is updated so that it no longer depends on the first package.

d) We wrote the first Pacman plug-in for "Egg".  This allows 
browsing of distributed Pacman caches, mirrors and installations.
