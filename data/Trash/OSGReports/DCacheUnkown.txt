The string 'unkown' appears in many places in the dCache source code.
Can you please add the missing 'n' to the string?
Uniformity may simplify future SQL queries and code searches.
There are also instances of 'Unknown' instead of 'unknown'.
They are not listed below, but are also worthy of your consideration.

Some of these changes might break things, but I don't think so.

Here is the list of known locations of the string 'unkown'. Line numbers are approximate.

In the directory =modules/dCache/dCacheV111/clients/vsp/=
<br>VspDevice.java - lines 86, 266
<br>VspListener.java - lines 28, 40

The next set are in =modules/dCache/dCacheV111/vehicles/=
<br>DCapClientProtocolInfo.java - line 10
<br>DCapProtocolInfo.java - line 9
<br>DoorInfo.java - line 9
<br>FtpProtocolInfo.java - line 6
