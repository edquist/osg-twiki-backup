The work by UCSD in Q4 was concentrated in 3 areas:
   * GRAM testing
   * SRM dCache
   * User group

The GRAM testing included writing adaptations for NFS-lite and managed fork for WS-GRAM, 
and making sure that both work with WS-GRAM. This was followed by an initial scalability and performance test.
documented at: http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki/bin/view/UCSDTier2/WSGramTests

In all of this, we had very productive exchanges with the Globus team.
The most important outcome of these tests is the realization that he WS-GRAM client using condor_g requires
significant hardware resources. We pointed this out to both condor and globus, and asked them to resolve it among each other.

As an aside, we found that WS-GRAM is more sensitive to subtle hardware problems than pre-WS GRAM, maybe because 
it's based on java.
The testing work for WS-GRAM required several reinstallations on different hardware before it worked reliably.
We believe to have identified this as memory problems in the hardware. The same exact hardware was good enough for
pre-WS GRAM testing. This subtlety is something to keep in mind for the future as we support a large scale WS-GRAM deployment
across diverse institutions on OSG.

The SRM dCache testing was focused on making sure that the needs of Atlas and CMS for CCRC08 are understood.
This involved testing interoperation of v1.7 and v1.8 dCache versions. In addition, work on "admin tools" has started.
A first set of tools is slated for release with OSG 1.0.

In addition, we found that the srmcp client as distributed with OSG 0.8 does not work with at least one of the
dCache installations at LHC Tier-1's in Europe (GridKa). This needs to be followed up.

User group activities beyond the usual ongoing work, included preparations for the OSG annual review.

On the human resources question. Toni Coarasa has started working part time on OSG.
His first project to work on is to take scripts a student wrote, and modify them such as to automate GRAM testing.
As he ramps up we will have completed our hiring for OSG.
