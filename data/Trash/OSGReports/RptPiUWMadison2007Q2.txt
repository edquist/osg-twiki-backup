<b>VDT Activities, January - June 2007</b>

At the end of 2006, the VDT team released VDT 1.6.0, which was intended to be the basis for the OSG 0.6.0 release in early 2007. In January 2007, this release was heavily tested by the OSG Trash/Trash/Integration Testbed. The VDT team was involved in this testing, and as a result of the testing released VDT 1.6.1 at the end of January. After some final testing, OSG 0.6.0 was released at the beginning of March. By the end of June, more than half the OSG sites had upgraded to OSG 0.6.0. Significant changes in this release included the integration of the Gratia accounting system, which provides insight into how OSG is used; new utilities to simplify management of VDT for OSG site administrators, a new version of Globus that unified the OSG and Teragrid customized versions of Globus, new platform support (particularly Scientific Linux 4), and many software upgrades and bug fixes.

By July 6th, 9 updates to VDT 1.6.1 were released. Three of the updates were for security fixes and were released shortly after the security problem was announced. Several of the releases addressed non-security related bugs, and one of the updates added two new software packages to the VDT.

The latter half of this period saw significant progress on work towards OSG 0.8.0. This was contained in two new development releases of the VDT (1.7.0 and 1.7.1) which were released at the end of May and the beginning of July respectively. The list of changes is too numerous to include here, but it includes a new tool for site administrators to test the correct functioning of thier site, new methods to maintain an up-to-date CA certificate installation, support for a new platform (RedHat Enterprise Linuux 5), new software (Bestman, Pegasus, Syslog-ng, and more), many updated software packages (about 30), and many bug fixes.
Figure 1  is a graph of VDT development since it began in 2002.
 

Although not completed, significant progress was made on supporting two new platforms: AIX and Mac OS X. The Macintosh port was greatly assisted by Apple Inc, which provided a software engineer for detailed consultation and work. We expect initial releases that support these platforms later this fall. 

The Storage VDT work, centered at Fermilab,  in the first half of 2007 has resulted in a custom packaging of dCache that greatly simplifies installation. 

There was also considerable progress on two external efforts:
   *  First, EGEE adopted VDT 1.6.1 for the gLite 3.1 software release. Most of the first half of 2007 was for testing and integration efforts, and in June 2006, the gLite 3.1 worker node software was released, based on VDT 1.6.1. 
   * Second, our close collaboration with TeraGrid continued, and OSG and TeraGrid collaborated to stay synchronized with our customized version of the Globus Toolkit. TeraGrid?s CTSS v4 release will correspond with OSG 0.8.0.
