---+++ Data Storage Access and Management (Gene Oleynik & Ted Hesselroth)
   * New releases of the VDT packaging of SRM-dCache continued, providing patches to the software and new features. A dCache Gratia probe was written and a bundle including installation scripts was made available. Work on linking VORS with srm-tester results and including a site-functional test suite in the package was started. Support for sites installing and using dCache was broadened through the use of a new osg-storage mailing list and the GOC and VDT ticket systems. Documentation for an overview of dCache, installation, pnfs backup procedure were written and linked to a new VDT web area. A topic was created on the OSG web site for user contributions which now contains eleven subtopics. A weekly meeting to coordinate Storage Activities has been initiated. 
   * should include GRATIA work by Greg in addition to dcache work
   * should include something about creation of osg-storage list, and lively reception of it by site administrators.
