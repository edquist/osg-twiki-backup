Torre Wenaus & Frank Wurthwein

2007Q1 covers activities between January 1st and March 31st 2007.

---+++ User Group Activities (Abhishek Singh Rana & Chris Green)
   * Chris on work with Engagement
   * Abhishek on OSG 0.6 and 0.8 release related stuff
   * Chris on site testing framework
   * Terrence on hands on workshop for site admins at OSG meeting
   * Abhishek on hands on workshop for users at OSG meeting
   * Abhishek on user session he chaired at OSG meeting
   * anything else I forgot?

   * (ASR input. TBC.) Prior to the release of OSG 0.6.0, extensive validation of the VO applications on the integration testbed (ITB 0.5) was performed. Official sign-off of a confirmed validation was received from ATLAS, CMS, CompBioGrid, GADU, GROW, LIGO, Fermilab, NanoHUB, and SDSS. As part of planning towards next major release OSG 0.8.0, User Group is in process of soliciting requirements from all major stakeholding VOs. Parallel effort is also directed towards collecting information on VO-specific job submission and workflow toolkits.

---+++ Support Application Integration
   * LIGO met it first milestone of sustaining continuously for one week, the utilization of  no less than 25 job slots on the cluster at UCSD. In addition LIGO completed its second milestone of sustaining continuously for one week, the utilization of no less than 100 job slots throughout the OSG several months ahead of schedule. 
   * Need paragraph from Torre on CHARMM
   * Would be good to have a paragraph from D0 on what's going on. Maybe Chris can get something form Parag?
   * Would be good to have something from Jerome on STAR
   * do we need something from the other VOs, i.e. Atlas, CDF, CMS, SDSS ? Don't think so.

---++++ Quarterly Science Benefit Report
as part of an effort to document the Science on the OSG, the OSG communications office prepares a 
[[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Science_on_the_OSG/Research_Highlights][Reseach Highlight]] roughly once a month.
These Research Highlights are written at a level appropriate for a generally educated audience, and are focused on
explaining the science rather than how it is done on the OSG.

For Q1 of 2007, the Science of GADU and CMS are highlighted in the February and March installments of this series.

---+++ Reliability and Scalability of the OSG Compute Element
Work in this area is delayed by delays in hiring and training at UCSD. To be specific, UCSD is training a graduate student
to fill in until the second hire for a full time staff member on OSG is completed.

At this point, the [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki/bin/view/UCSDTier2/ComputeElementBenchmarking][testing methodology]]
is documented, and a set of basic tools to do the testing was written. The means to automatize the tests are missing, as well as
reporting tools for displaying the test results do not exist yet.


---+++ Data Storage Access and Management (Gene Oleynik & Ted Hesselroth)
   * New releases of the VDT packaging of SRM-dCache continued, providing patches to the software and new features. A dCache Gratia probe was written and a bundle including installation scripts was made available. Work on linking VORS with srm-tester results and including a site-functional test suite in the package was started. Support for sites installing and using dCache was broadened through the use of a new osg-storage mailing list and the GOC and VDT ticket systems. Documentation for an overview of dCache, installation, pnfs backup procedure were written and linked to a new VDT web area. A topic was created on the OSG web site for user contributions which now contains eleven subtopics. A weekly meeting to coordinate Storage Activities has been initiated. This meeting brings together storage people from OSG, storage software developers, and site administrators, and has resulted in a very lively forum in which site administrators provide feedback to developers, with OSG in the middle as brokers of the communications, and follow up on support issues.

---+++ "Just in time" Workload Management System (Torre Wenaus)
   * need info here from Torre 
   * maybe CHARM stuff goes here instead of above ?
