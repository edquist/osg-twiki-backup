_External Communication:_ OSG was present at the Digital Divide meeting in Mexico City in November, and contact was established between the Engagement activity and local researchers interested in adapting applications to run on a distributed infrastructure. The institutes in Mexico aim to organize themselves for a regional grid and OSG will be prepared to help facility and educate in these areas. Discussions at the NSF International Research Network Collaborations (IRNC) about the relevance of middleware to the end to end performance of data distribution and job execution over diverse networks were relevant and useful.

The status of the common middleware, VDT and WLCG baseline services in the US, as well as the status and plans for the US Tier-2s were presented at the LHC Comprehensive Review. The reviewers seemed satisfied with the information and there were no significant questions. The reviewers report has not yet been published.

The iSGTW advisory board met at CERN. Cristy Burne has agreed to remain as iSGTW editor for another six-twelve months.  The EGEE has been allocated one additional FTE to work on communications and iSGTW activities as part of a GridTalk project funded by the EU through the GridPP project. This is in addition to the half-FTE each that EGEE and OSG contribute to the iSGTW editor position.  OSG management is currently unable to increase the contributions in this area.  

The Executive Director and PI visited NSF MPS Division for a day and have a list of action items and deliverables with respect to new communities to contact about potential engagement.  

_Project and Resource Management:_  We processed the final year1 WBS updates to close out the year1 work program; all incomplete WBS milestones were examined critically to determine a disposition (complete, cancel, or carry-forward to year2) and these plans were reviewed and approved by the OSG Executive Team.  A full year1 status of finances and work completion was presented at the November 2, 2007 Finance Board; this body accepted the recommendations and commended the process improvements achieved in year1.

The year2 planning process was pushed forward to being essentially complete.  All Statements-of-Work (SOW) were prepared to document the work to be performed at the seventeen institutions during year2; greater than 75% of these SOWs completed our internal review process by Nov 15 to meet the planned goal.  The year2 WBS was base-lined and the year2 budget was finalized and approved by the OSG-EB.   And logistical preparation for the OSG Annual Review (scheduled for Jan 22, 23) was completed.

_User Communication:_ Effort on OSG Communications was deployed toward analysis and update of the OSG website to improve navigation and ease of use.  Monthly OSG newsletters were produced and distributed.  FNAL personnel contributed two articles to iSGTW highlighting research and resources on OSG covering CHARMM and Fermigrid.  The Campus CI days website was made ready for publication. We participated in the NYSGrid CI days event to strengthen the NYSGrid-OSG partnership and to assess further interest in CI activities and in OSG from other New York campuses. A poster was presented at the annual e-social science conference to introduce this new audience to OSG. We assisted the Integration activity with Release Documentation reorganization and update for OSG release 0.8.0.  The Documentation home page was also reviewed and updated.
