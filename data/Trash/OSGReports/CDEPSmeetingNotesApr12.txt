---+ Meeting with CEDPS & OSG

---++ Introduction
   * Attending: Ruth, Don, Brian, Jennifer, Rob

---++ Background
Ruth is giving a background to the agreement and expectations between the CEDPS project and OSG.  There is a document.  
   * No OSG plans for MDS4 or trigger service.
   * Anomaly detection == troubleshooting (Jen clarification)

---++ Serial notes
   * Centralized logging could be helpful to security infrastructure, though that is not the central purpose.
   * Post October 2007 milestones
   * Trigger service - have not discussed in integration yet, need readiness plan. CEDPS is working on the algorithm for this.
   * Parsers for the existing Globus logfiles - reformat into a generalized format. 
   * Note that no GT2 log parsing will be done.
   * Security: Don - question is can the troubleshooting infrastructure support OSG security. There are use cases that Don has.
