Joined the troubleshooting team in December.  Looked into the transition to voms-proxy-init as a potential topic for the troubleshooting group, but we resolved that it did not fit the criteria for our group.  Began looking into the STAR efficiency problems.

February:
Debugged some authorization timeout issues in STAR efficiency.
Debugged a PBS exit code issue at Vanderbilt.
Debugged a softenv issue at TTU.
Joined a weekly WS GRAM status call.

March: Continued WS-GRAM adoption, STAR SRM/DRM Testing.

April: STAR issue resolved as xinetd bug (!!).  Most of my time was spent looking at TCP traces from the failing connections to no result, not sure how Wayne eventually tracked it down.  Email thread: STAR SRM/DRM testing

Discussed issue of stale files in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/tmp/gram_job_state causing gridmanager to impose a high load on the CE.  To be resolved with gridmanager caching.  Email thread: Spaced out

May: CE high load problem at UCSD, interim solution of killing with a script, possible long-term solution of either GRAM4 or GRAM2 SEG.  Email thread: CE high load problem?

June-July: Tracking a stage-out problem which looks to be a race between GRAM's stage-out and condor-g's kill/restart of the jobmanager.  Results in a double stage-out with a second 0-byte file overwriting the original correct output.  Email thread: stdout handling in 6.9.2
