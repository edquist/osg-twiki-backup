Joined the troubleshooting team in December.  Looked into the transition to voms-proxy-init as a potential topic for the troubleshooting group, but we resolved that it did not fit the criteria for our group.  Began looking into the STAR efficiency problems.

February:
Debugged some authorization timeout issues in STAR efficiency.
Debugged a PBS exit code issue at Vanderbilt.
Debugged a softenv issue at TTU.
Joined a weekly WS GRAM status call.
