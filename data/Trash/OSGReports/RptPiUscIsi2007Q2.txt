During the second quarter of 2007, ISI worked closely with LIGO/Caltech on the following tasks:

1) Training: The ISI team conducted training and tutorials sessions at Caltech and ISI to teach new LIGO team members how to run the LIGO scientific workflows on the Grid.  

2) Investigation of Condor stdout handling:   The ISI team, along with LIGO, OSG troubleshooting team, and Condor  developers is investigating a bug regarding stdout handling in Condor 6.9.2,. A unit test case that triggers the bug, has been identified. Currently, testing is going on with different logging options to understand the source of the bug.  The bug has been identified in the interaction between the Condor gridmanager and Globus jobmanager software components.

3) Clustered stageout:   In order to efficiently manage the stage-out of the final data products from the OSG sites, a transfer scheme was implemented in Pegasus. This transfer scheme allows the users to specify the number of stageout transfer jobs that are added to the workflow irrespective of the number of jobs in the workflow. This solution scales much better for larger workflows, than the default case where each compute job is associated with a stage-out job.

4) Automatic construction of paths where the Pegasus worker executables are installed on OSG sites: Originally, a user had to enter in his transformation catalog entries for Pegasus server side tools (such as dirmanager, cleanup, and transfer executables) for each OSG site. This is no longer required as Pegasus constructs the paths automatically with respect to the environment variables PEGASUS_HOME or VDS_HOME specified for the site in the site catalog.

5) Migration to the standalone Pegasus release: Pegasus recently moved to a standalone release outside of VDS. As part of the release the replica interfaces in Pegasus were modified. Work was done by the ISI team to port LIGO-specific replica query features into the new release Pegasus release. The ISI team also worked on other migration tools that allowed the LIGO users to migrate to the new standalone Pegasus 2.0 release.

6) Experiments with the dynamic data cleanup algorithms: The ISI team worked with LIGO to run experiments using LIGO workflows on OSG using the dynamic data cleanup features. These experiments resulted in a paper submitted to the Scientific Programming Journal.
