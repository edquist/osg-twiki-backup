---+ Status Reports for Ben Clifford

---++ January 2007

   * Placed OSG workshop content under revision control (via OSG twiki)
   * Modularized workshop content to facilitated use in workshops of different lengths and topic focus
   * Conducted review of all the tutorial material from the 2006 Grid Workshop with technical write Forrest Christian so that we have a common base for working, and plan to split it up and turn it it into easier-to-reuse pieces (motivated initially by the needs of the March workshops in Argentina and Chicago)
   * Reviewed and planned technical and systems support needs for future OSG workshops
   * Revised workflow workshop for newer technology, upgrading from VDS to [[http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift][Swift]]
   * Presented workflow workshop module at I2U2 collaboration meeting at Adler in Chicago
   * Started work on content for the Argentina school coming up in March
   * Attended Open Grid Forum sessions on education and training, establishing relationship with the UK e-Science training people (Malcolm Atkinson and David Fergusson)
   * Described US progress in I2U2 and on Grid Workshops at the OGF Education session

---++ March 2007

   * 3 day grid workshop in argentina - prep, lectures, exercises; 1 week informal outreach work with universided de buenos aires
   * midwest grid workshop - lead exercises. some lectures as fill-in for missing lecturers.

---++ April 2007
   * on-going training machine construction, to reduce on going sysadmin costs (which have proved effective in subsequent months) (this month to July at least)
   * on-going exercise text modularisation (this month to July at least)

---++ May 2007
   * meeting in oklahoma to discuss south africa outreach: http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=16658

---++ June 2007
   * Rio Grande grid school
   * support for re-use of training machine installations in workshop in Bogota (fairly minimal, a couple of hours - listed more as a good example of benefits coming from the work done for this)

---++ July 2007
   * Participation in ISSGC07
   * Preparation work hands on practical parts for Great Plains Grid Workshop - liase with site tech contact, and machine/exercise text prep

---++ August 2007

   * Ported labs to docbook
Previously we'd been keeping lab exercises in this wiki. This was scaling poorly. I ported the labs to docbook+SVN in the hope that they would work better. They do.

   * Great Plains Grid School - lab co-ordinator and instructor
First school using docbook exercises. That worked well.
Yet another attempt at finding the right way to do certificates. The approach tried here worked very well. Students were able to submit to the largest number of grid sites of any of the grid schools that I've been to; and almost all came away with their own DOE CA credential to take home, authorised to use OSGEDU hosts.
Approximately the right level and number of students for me to feel comfortable.

   * Hosted 3 south african students at University of Chicago: Norman Ives, Martin Cook and Claire Lee.

Norman and Martin were focused more in site operations, claire was more interested in applications (specifically physics applications).

Monday:
spent the day working through Siddhartha E.S's site installation tutorial, on Norman and Martin's two linux laptops; we were able to submit hello-world level jobs through GRAM and gridftp.

Tuesday:
worked on some more installation tasks. Claire ported one of her physics applications built using the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/">ROOT system</a> to run inside the swift workflow system, through GRAM to submit to Norman's laptop and thence to condor and successful execution. Unfortunately, I could not find real OSG sites with ROOT installed in time for her to try that. In the afternoon, I introduced the three of them to Rob Gardner (who had been previously introduced to them by email); he gave an impromptu talk and demo of his involvement in ATLAS. Martin and Norman then worked for a while with Marco Mambelli getting his ATLAS testing code talking to their laptop installs. This worked and discovered some misconfigurations in their installs.

Wednesday:
went to fermilab where we saw a tour of the computing facilities and met Ruth Pordes.
