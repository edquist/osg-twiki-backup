<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE ONLY! -->

During the quarter ending September 30, 2007, ISI performed the following tasks:

 
   * Resolution of condor stdout handling bug:   The ISI team worked with LIGO and Condor and Globus folks to identify and resolve the bug in Condor stdout handling.  The ISI team also provided LIGO support in making sure that the solution resolved all issues on the various grid sites.

   * Helped tracing a bug and resolving it in the LIGO inspiral pipeline (Gap in data problem ):  There was a bug in the ligo inspiral codes, whereby the template bank jobs failed while running on the OSG using Pegasus. However, the jobs ran successfully when run on the LIGO Compute Grid through DAGMan.  A bug was identified in the inspiral code, where it did not pick up the input files correctly.

   * Work with the LIGO team to achieve the 3rd OSG-LIGO milestone:  The ISI team actively worked with the LIGO team at ISI to achieve the third milestone in late August. The milestone involved LIGO running across the OSG and using 1000 compute slots.

   * Moving to GT4 gram submissions:  The ISI team did preliminary work with the LIGO team to get the LIGO workflows running on OSG through WS-GRAM.
