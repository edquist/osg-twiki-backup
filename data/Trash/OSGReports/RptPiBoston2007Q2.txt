Author: Saul Youssef

    During the past quarter, funding for the 1/2 FTE for Pacman support and 
development arrived at Boston University and work on the project.  Saul 
Youssef (project manager) has recruited a person to do this work (John Brunelle) 
on a part-time basis as described in the SOW.  Use of Pacman continues to grow
on a world-wide basis with more then 2.7 million downloads of the tarball in total
to more than 50 countries and more than 4.6 million new Pacman installations in 2006.

    Pacman support activities in the last quarter consisted of modest fixes, platform
updates, adding Gentoo as a supported platform and providing user feedback when
problems come up (http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/htmls/Release_notes.html).  An 
important new feature ("pacballs") has been added in this quarter which allows one 
to capture a Pacman environment in a machine independent self-contained 
self-installing file.  A pacball can then be installed without Pacman being 
installed first and without internet access.  This is meant to be particularly 
useful for grid applications and for archiving software environments. Semi-continuous
pre-release testing of Pacman has been done on all 19 supported platforms making
use of the grandcentral cluster at the University of Wisconsin.

    As described in the SOW, Saul has collaborated with Alain Roy and the VDT team
in terms of identifying any particular needs from VDT or OSG and planning for the 
next year.  These needs can be divided into short term incremental requests or problems
(which can be handled within the scope of this funding) and major structural improvements.
As Alain is in Washington for the rest of the summer, the plan is to address any urgent
or short term problems as they come up and meet in person at the end of the summer to
plan for more major improvements.  Saul has also been in contact with Panda team and 
the ATLAS Software Infrastructure Team in order to identify improvements which could 
be made in the distribution of ATLAS software (which is Pacman based) to the OSG sites.
