I also participated in weekly security team conference calls and assisted the OSG security officer in completing the security audit checklist for internal OSG sites.  I monitored the various security alert lists and assisted in evaluating the impact of newly discovered vulnerabilities on OSG supported / distributed packages and assisted in OSG incident response for several potential grid security incidents including one I pursued and reported over the holiday break.
