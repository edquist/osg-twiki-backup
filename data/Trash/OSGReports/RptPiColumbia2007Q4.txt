Following the successful submission of jobs from Wits to OSG in the previous reporting period, the group has been concentrating on developing local applications to run on OSG.  Initial applications have included Mineral positron-emission tomography (PET) jobs and simulations for the South African Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) project.  Work with the Wits bio-computation group is ongoing.  After a significant delay in completing the paperwork for the funding from OSG to Columbia to Wits, the first year OSG funds are now available for hardware purchases.  

The Columbia and Wits groups are planning with OSG EOT an international OSG Grid School to be held at Wits in July 2008.  We expect between 30-40 students from South Africa and neighboring countries, and the participation of a number of South African institutes, including the Center for High Performance Computing.
