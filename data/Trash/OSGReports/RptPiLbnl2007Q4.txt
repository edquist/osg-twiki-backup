*Storage Activities*

!BeStMan (the Berkeley Storage Manager) was included as an SRM V2.2 compliant storage
element in the OSG 0.8 release anjd was deployed at BNL and NERSC, primarily in support
of STAR data transport and anlaysis.  Updates of features delivered to OSG
following the 0.8 release include space reservation based on tokens and a bug fix
about handling limited proxies.

Daily SRM testing continues for both V1.1 and V2.2 versions with results posted at http://datagrid.lbl.gov/.
This includes adding a few new sites for testing as well as reporting problems found to
the administrators of those sites.

Alex also prepared materials for the Grid School and exercises for SRM based storage usage and data management.

*Trash/Trash/Integration Activities*

VTB/ITB:<br/>
Carried out a variety of WS-GRAM testing and debugging activities including scalability tests, 
installation and configuration issues, SGE batch system interface, as well as running a
weekly WS-GRAM meeting and documenting validation and installation for the ITB 0.7 release.
Participated in the effort to have WS-GRAM installation correctly report via ReSS.

Maintained VTB and ITB sites at LBNL used for testing, installation and configuration issues
for new releases of VDT, SGE batch system interface, NFS issues, firewall configuration issues
and reporting any discovered security problems.

*Security Activities*

OSG RA<br/>
There were 432 personal certificate issued and 1286 host/service certificates issued in this quarter by DOEGrids CA, the majority of which were via the OSG registration authority. There were 11 people authorized for gridadmin access to the CA, allowing automated host certificate issuance as well as four people who renewed their registration agent privilege.

Prepared registration materials including samples of registration agent logs for the internal audit of the DOEGrids CA which took place in December.  The audit was part of the ongoing !EUGridPMA accreditation process.

Security Plan activities<br/>
Over the course of this quarter we conducted an evaluation of the security controls for OSG as defined in the OSG Security Plan. For 2007, this was primarily a data collection and interview process to gather information from all the people responsible for the core services of OSG. The results of this are shown at ControlsAssessment2007 which is a matrix of core services and the information gathered about the various security controls applicable to those services.
This was a learning experience for all involved and we expect changes and improvements in the process, and controls, for the 2008 cycle.

Policy activities<br/>
A discussion about policies relating to what are called Robot certificates is expected to lead to this new type of certificate being available from DOEgrids in the future.
