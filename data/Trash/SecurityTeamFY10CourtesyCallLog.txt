---++ Jeff !DeReus (GROW VO)

Email	jeffrey-dereus@uiowa.edu

Phone	1-319-335-6079

Call scheduled 2pm Mon Aug 17 2009.

http://www.its.uiowa.edu/research/grow

https://grow-voms.its.uiowa.edu:8443/voms/GROW

GROW applications are coming from several disciplines including Atmospheric Science, Bioinformatics, Computational Science, Environmental Science, Geographic Information Science, High Energy and Particle Physics, Management Science, Medical Imaging, and Statistical Computing. GROW will provide computing resources to OSG as well as be interested in using both computing and data resources on OSG.

Community:	Grid computing/application communities within the state of Iowa and their affiliated stakeholders

Jeff attended OSG AHM earlier this year. Didn't come to site admins workshop due to limited funding.
Using same name as old GROW VO (based on OSG recommendation) but new install.
User community not appearing. Discussing with Abhishek.
Bringing up a new cluster.

Jeff is responsible for OSG system admin and other systems.
Bringing the VO up was easy.
Some OSG 1.2 upgrade documentation troubles, though. 
Got certificates OK. Became RA agent.

VO membership will be based on Iowa faculty sponsorship.
Will run VO jobs on campus first.
New cluster will mainly serve GROW VO members. Backfill with campus Condor. Willing to serve other OSG VOs while waiting for GROW VO membership to appear.

No security concerns.

---++ Scott Beardsley (UCD_T3: UC Davis T3 CMS SE and CE nodes)

Email	sbeardsley@ucdavis.edu

Phone	+1 530 752 0547

Call scheduled 1:30pm Mon Aug 17 2009.

Bill Broadley <bill@ucdavis.edu> will also join.

Supported VOs	cms mis ops osg

cms.tier3.ucdavis.edu:2119

Scott and Bill are the cluster team at UC-Davis. They're officially in the Geology department and manage 10-15 clusters across campus departments supporting computational science and engineering. Brought CMS T3 cluster up in collaboration with the Physics department. They just recently got the cluster hardware. Other clusters in other departments are not in OSG and have separate accounting.

Scott was at the recent site admins workshop in Indy. His first OSG meeting. He joins the T3 calls. Bill is less focused on grid aspects but is knowledgeable about cluster security.

Scott asked about FNAL KCA using MD5. I told him about new FNAL KCA coming online with IGTF approval using SHA-1.

Concerns:
   * CA bundle signing. move to https.
   * signing of VDT/OSG software. They use signed RPM/Debian packages on their systems.
   * Brought the CMS cluster up using SL5. ISO on HTTP site. No checksum. Can we raise this as a SL security concern? Could OSG Security Team provide checksums for SL distributions? Could put MD5SUM or SHA1SUMS of ISO directory on https server. Provide https page for verifying packages / CAs.
   * They're using DLV: publish dnssec keys with ISC. Could OSG use it?
   * Where to find a summary of different services and ports required for OSG? Squid needs a monitoring port open. Can we provide firewall rules?
   * They are using GUMS. Do they still need a grid-mapfile? CEMon requires it?
