---+++!!Engineering Considerations
The [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway][BeStMan Installation Guide]] provides detailed instructions and various configuration options. Please refer to this guide for more information.
It is recommended to install !BeStMan on its own server though in principal it could be installed on CE node and configured to use !GridFTP server already installed with CE.  
You can choose to run multiple GridFTP servers to achieve load balance and better performance if you are installing !BeStMan not on the local disk but on NFS or some other DFS. If you really expecting a heavy load on your SE you should acquire additional nodes for your !GRidFTP servers
