---+ Reasons for a hanging CE
---++ Too much condor_shadow processes 

If you use condor, each running job needs a condor_shadow process on the submitter, which consumes some little ammount memmory each, but if you run, let's say 2000 jobs under the same CE, you will have (a litte * 2000) memmory being consumed, Until it starts to swap and eventually hang the system, or let it very slow. 

One of the solutions is to scale to more than one CE, or add a extra CE  to your site, and if is to jump from 1 to 2 CE's, you can also benefit from the backup and maintenance pros, as you can do a maintenance on 1 CE while the other works, and your site won't be down.

Other solution is to raise the available memmory on the CE(s).

Other solutions that may limit your CE Capacity - and letting it do just what it can take :

   * Limit the number of running condor_shadow processes by condor configuration
   * Set on condor configuration a lower priority (renice) for these processes - they don't need a high one
