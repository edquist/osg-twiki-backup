The Fermilab VO acceptance tests are continuously run against both the OSG production and integration sites.  The latest results for the OSG integration sites are available at:

http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/monitor/fermigrid0-fermilab-vo-integration-monitor-summary.html

The only failure we saw was against BNL_ITB_Test1 where we were unable to
globus-url-copy back the file that we put there.  This is due to a recent change in 
Keith's DN such that his DN mapped to a different pool account than it did previously
and he could no longer write his test directory.  We do not consider this a barrier
to deployment of the new release.

Fermilab VO does not test SE's, except for the one we run on our own site.
