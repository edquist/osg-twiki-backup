_This page outlines how to test and validate the RSV probes for SEs._

%BR%

---++ Setup
In your =config.ini= file, go to the RSV section, and change the option for =enable_srm_probes= to =%(enable)=.   Then change =srm_hosts= settings to point to your SE's gateway. Finally, set =srm_dir= to a directory on your SE that the rsv user has permissions to write to. Then turn off your vdt services on your CE, rerun =configure-osg.py= to configure the rsv service, and then turn on your services.

---++ Validation
In order to validate this, go to the CE or RSV probe server that runs your rsv probes.  Your SE should appear in the web page in a green box.
