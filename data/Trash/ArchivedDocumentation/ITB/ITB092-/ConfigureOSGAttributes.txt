At this point, there are several OSG attributes (environmental variables) that need to be established for required and optional CE services to run effectively.  

For those sites who plan to publish SRM information using their GIP, and use GUMS to do authentication, it is essential that =vdt-control --on= is run *before* the =configure-osg.sh= script is invoked, and also that the =gums-host-cron= script is once invoked manually.  Otherwise the =configure-osg.sh= script will error out.

The attributes are set by executing the =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.sh= script. This script functions in "question and answer" mode and does the following:
   * If the =VDT_OLD_LOCATION= environment variable is set and points to a previous installation of the OSG CE software stack, the =configure-osg.sh= script will attempt to get the settings from the =osg-attributes.conf= file from that installation.
   * Collects all the information described in the [[ComputeElementInstallGuide#CE_Site_Adminstrator_Overview][CE Site Administrator Overview]] section of this document. 
   * It configures <nop>Integration.MonALISA using the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_monalisa</i> script.  %RED%obsolete (and for ff)?%ENDCOLOR%
   * If you asked for <nop>Integration.MonALISA to be activated, an <i>/etc/init.d/MLD</i> will be added to your systems rc.d services and started.  <br>
If you did not wish <nop>Integration.MonALISA to be activated, it will still run the <i>configure_monalisa</i> script but without the option to activate it.  
   * On the first execution only, it will copy the =./monitoring/locations/grid3-locations.txt= to =$OSG_APP/etc= with  666 permissions.
   * It configures the Generic Information Providers (GIP) using the =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg-gip.sh= script.  More instructions on the correct inputs to the =configure_gip= script can be found on the GenericInformationProviders page.  Note that if you add support for VO's other than the default VO's later, you will have to reconfigure the generic information providers at that time with the =configure-osg-gip.sh= script.

With each successful execution of the =configure-osg.sh= script:
   * the =osg-attributes.conf= file is updated
   * a backup of your previous =osg-attributes.conf= is saved as =osg-attributes.conf.osgsave.[n]= 

The =configure-osg.sh= script is in a state of transition at this point.  For the long term, the intent is to use this single script for the collection and distribution of all data needed on an OSG CE node to insure consistent and timely distribution of information and configuration.  At this time the =configure_monalisa= %RED%obsolete?%ENDCOLOR% and =configure-osg-gip.sh= scripts are included. 

Usage:
| =./configure-osg.sh= | Executes the script in question and answer mode |
| =./configure-osg.sh  --help= | Steps through the set of information to be collected |
| =./configure-osg.sh  --display= | Displays the current osg-attributes.conf attributes |
