---++ General Information

I tested the sites by submitting a 'small' (using a small amount of LIGO input data, producing a small amount of intermediate/output data) LIGO work-flow. This work-flow contained 10 nodes, including directory creation jobs at the remote site, simple chmod jobs, a  data transfer job  to the remote site, the stage in of Pegasus executables and some LIGO specific complex data analysis jobs. The output data was tar-ed and transferred back to the submit host as part of the work-flow.

I also attempted to deploy the E@OSG software at the 5 ITB sites
