The Fermilab VO acceptance tests are continuously run against both the OSG production
<br>
and integration sites.  The latest results for the OSG integration sites are available at:

http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/monitor/fermigrid0-fermilab-vo-integration-monitor-summary.html

The only failure we saw was against BNL_ITB_Test1 where we were unable to
globus-url-copy back the file that we put there.
