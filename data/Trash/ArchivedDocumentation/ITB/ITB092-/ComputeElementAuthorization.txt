Have you determined which mode of authorization you plan to use at your site?  If not, see [[AboutOsgCEAuth][Description of OSG CE Authorization Modes]].

---++ A note about edg-mkgridmap
Prior to this release, the =edg-mkgridmap= script ran as a system service and installed in =/etc/init.d=. With this release, it is being installed as a <i>root</i> crontab entry.  If you are upgrading from a prior release, you must <i>stop</i> the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> daemon and delete that entry from system services.

%NOTE% =edg-mkgridmap= is not installed/configured by default.

---++ Identify the OSG VOs your CE node supports and any undefined UNIX accounts
Beginning with OSG 0.6.0, you can verify that your authorization service supports all the intended VOs and that all the necessary UNIX accounts exist on your CE node.  See [[OsgSupportedVos][Supported VOs and Undefined UNIX Accounts]].

---++ Implement the Authorization of your choice
We point you off to a separate page for each option:
   * [[OsgCEAuthGrid3][Grid3/Local]]
   * [[OsgCEAuthCompatibility][Compatibility]]
   * [[OsgCEAuthFullPriv][Full Privilege]]
