 !BeStMan-gateway, developed by the Scientific Data Management Group of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, is a generic SRM v2.2 load balancing frontend for GridFTP servers.
This document is written for system administrators who are planning to use storage that is installed on top of any Posix file system.  The goal of this document is to give enough information for system administrators to do initial simple configuration of the storage as well as provide references to the documents that may help to accomplish more sophisticated configuration. 

See also [[Bestman][Bestman full mode]] for more information about !BeStMan full mode installation and  [[BestmanGatewayXrootd][BestmanGateway-Xrootd]] for more information about !BestmanGateway-Xrootd.

---++ Proposed Architecture 
!BeStMan-gateway storage consists of the following components: 
   * !BeStMan-gateway is a partial implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by LBNL, for disk based storage systems maintenance [[http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman  BeStMan Home Page]] 
   * !GridFTP server  provides a high-performance, secure, reliable data transfer [[http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/3.2/gridftp GridFTP documentation]]
   * POSIX-compliant FS 
   * optional package - Gratia gridftp transfer probe - cron job that reports all the file transfers to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaSiteCollector Gratia collector]]

     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/bestman_gateway_arch.jpeg" alt="bestman_gateway_arch.jpeg" width='384' height='288' />    
---++ Configuration decisions 
 
The following questions should be answered before you can proceed with installation and 
configuration of !BeStMan-gateway storage solution: 
 
Q. _How many nodes could be used for storage?_ 
    
  The absolute minimum number of nodes is 1: 
Usually one would prefer to separate !GridFTP from !BeStMan for better 
performance.   Also, you may want to  have multiple !GridFTP server. The decision 
should be based on your load and storage requirements.  
 
Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_ 
 
You have to decide if you want to use grid-map-file or !GUMS server for users’ 
authentication and authorization. 
More details about !GUMS could be found at 
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/InstallConfigureAndManageGUMS GUMS Installation Guide]]  
 
Q. _Do you need to support space tokens?_  

!BeStMan-gateway supports predefined, static space tokens that should be 
included in configuration. It doesn't keep trace or enforce static space tokens.  If 
you want partition your storage space and have a “designated” space for some 
VOs or users you can choose to use space tokens. You will have to decide the 
names and descriptions of the tokens as well as the size of the area.  

Q. _Do you want to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_

If you want to report all the transfers in and out of your storage you would need to install or enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes. More details should be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome  Gratia Home Page]]. The reported information will include the source and destination of transfer, certificate subject of transfer initiator, size and status of the transferred file.  

---++ !BeStMan-gateway Installation
 
!BeStMan-gateway implements a subset of !SRM v2.2 specifications that includes: 
   *  !srmPing() 
   *  !srmGetTransferProtocols() 
   *  !srmLs()  
   *  !srmRm()  
   *  !srmMkdir()  
   *  !srmRmdir() 
   *  !srmPrepareToPut()  
   *  !srmPrepareToGet()  
   *  !srmPutDone()  
   *  !srmReleaseFiles()  
   *  !srmGetSpaceTokens() 
   *  !srmGetSpaceMetaData()  

Some of the abovementioned specs are just partially implemented. 
For more information see [[http://wt2.slac.stanford.edu/xrootdfs/bestman-gateway.html BeStMan gateway Home Page]] 

---+++ Create an installation directory
Create a directory, e.g.  /opt/%CACHE%-bestman. Make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 
We will refer to this directory as _&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_. 

---+++ Downloading !BeStMan-gateway 
The installation described here is done as root even though services does not  run as root:

    * A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed.
      Please answer y (yes) so that the software can be retrieved. If you do not want to use grid-map file to set up the mappings from global identities (user certificate names) to local accounts please answer n (no) to the following question:
Do you want edg-mkgridmap daemon to be run via cron? [y/n] n



See the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Integration/ITB092/PacmanBestPractices][Pacman]] section of this guide if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message. 

<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt:GUMS hostname&gt;      # if you want to use GUMS for GridFtp autorization
pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman 
</pre>


To check what services have been installed on your node you can do:

<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
 vdt-control --list

Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs   | cron   | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | enable
gratia-gridftp-tran| cron   | do not enable
bestman            | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron     | cron   | do not enable
</pre>

Follow the instructions provided in _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README_ to configure CA package updates.

---+++ Configuring !BeStMan-gateway 
You will need to configure !BeStMan to enable gateway-mode. You have to decide if you 
would like to use static space token reservation, and in this case to come up with a list of 
token names, description and size of space allocated for each token. Keep in mind that in 
gateway-mode !BeStMan is not managing your space. 

  
The example below shows how to configure !BeStMan in gateway-mode, enable !GUMS
and space token usage: 
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_bestman --server y \ 
 --user &lt;user&gt; \ 
 --cert &lt;service_cert&gt;  \ 
 --key  &lt;service_key&gt;  \ 
 --http-port  &lt;public_port&gt;  \  
 --https-port  &lt;secured_port&gt;  \ 
 --gums-host  &lt;GUMS hostname&gt;  \ 
 --gums-port  &lt;GUMS port number&gt;  \ 
 --gums-dn  &lt;Client DN for GUMS interface&gt;  \ 
 --enable-gateway  \ 
 --with-allowed-paths="&lt;allowed_dir_list&gt;"  \ 
 --with-blocked-paths="&lt;blocked_dir_list&gt;"  \ 
 --with-tokens-list  "&lt;TOKEN_1_NAME&gt;[desc:&lt;TOKEN_1_DESC&gt;][&lt;TOKEN_1_SIZE_GB&gt;];&lt;TOKEN_2_NAME&gt;[desc:&lt;TOKEN_2_DESC&gt;][&lt;TOKEN_2_SIZE&gt;]"   \ 
 --with-transfer-servers  &lt;GridFTP server list&gt;  
</pre> 
 
Where  _user_ name of the non-privileged user that runs !BeStMan, <br/>
_service_cert_  path to service certificate (the certificate file should belong to the _user_)<br/>
_service_key_  path to service certificate private key (the certificate key file should belong to the _user_). Currently some clients (lcg-utils tool) require that service certificate is a host certificate <br/>
_public_port_ http public port (default : 10080;commonly used port is 8080 unless there is a conflict) <br/> 
_secured_port_ http private port (default: 10443;commonly used port is 8443 unless there is a conflict) <br/> 
_allowed_dir_list_ list of directories, separated by semicolon, accessible to users <br/>
_blocked_dir_list_ list of directories separated by semicolon, non-accessible to users (default are "/;/etc;/var") . One of the  --with-allowed-paths / --with-bloacked-paths options should be used.<br/>
_GUMS hostname_ the name of  !GUMS server, <br/> 
_GUMS port number_ the port of !GUMS  server, <br/>   
_Client DN for GUMS_ interface is a service certificate subject. To get _Client DN for GUMS_ execute<br/> 
<pre>
openssl x509 -subject -noout -in &lt;_service_cert_&gt; 
</pre>
 _GridFTP server list_  is a list !FQDN of your !GridFTP servers, separated by ; . e.g. 
“gsiftp://host1.domain.tld;gsiftp://host2.domain.tld” <br/> 

If you want to use grid-map-file for user authentication and authorization do not specify 
the following options:
 
 --gums-host   

 --gums-port 

 --gums-dn   
 
If you do not want to use statically reserved space tokens do not specify the following 
options: 

--with-tokens-list 

Please, make the appropriate modification to _/etc/sudoers_ described in !BeStMan 
documentation, namely add the following lines to this file: 
<pre class="screen">
Cmnd_Alias SRM_CMD = /bin/rm, /bin/mkdir, /bin/rmdir, /bin/mv, /bin/ls 
Runas_Alias SRM_USR = ALL, !root 
&lt;user_name&gt; ALL=(SRM_USR) NOPASSWD: SRM_CMD 
 </pre>
Please keep in mind that this is just an example, you can choose more  be more restrictive policy for your site.

If you are running your !BeStMan-gateway on the node that doesn’t have an access to 
your FS you will have to modify the following attributes in _$VDT_LOCATION/bestman/conf/bestman.rc_
configuration file: 
<pre class="screen"> 
checkSizeWithFS=false 
checkSizeWithGsiftp=true 
</pre>

--+++ Configuring !GridFTP
!GridFTP server comes with !BeStMan installation. 
If you want to use the grid-map-file for user authentication and authorization ignore the 
rest of this section. 
Copy two files from _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install_ to in _/etc/grid-security_: 
 
<pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>
 
You can have multiple installation of  !GridFTP servers located on  the nodes you have 
specified in !BeStMan-gateway configuration (see section about standalone !GridFTP installation if you want to install it as a standalone server).

You will need to make sure that users have write permission in to the storage area.  

---+++ Gratia gridftp-transfer Probe
If you are using !GridFTP server that is installed during the !BeStMan installation you will need just to enable Gratia grdiftp-transfer probe and perform the actions described in
 [[GratiaTrasnferProbe][Preparing, Installing and Validating Gratia transfer probe]]


---++ Installation of standalone !GridFTP 
 
!GridFTP server comes with !BeStMan installation. 
If you want to use the grid-map-file for user authentication and authorization ignore the 
rest of this section. 

If you want to use !GUMS for user authorization you will need to install !PRIMA package 
from VDT  
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
export VDT_GUMS_HOST=&lt:GUMS hostname&gt; 
pacman -get %CACHE%:PRIMA 
</pre>
 
Where _GUMS hostname_ is a !GUMS server and   
_&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_  is a root directory of %CACHE% installation. 
 
Then copy two files from _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install_ to in _/etc/grid-security_: 
 
<pre class="screen">
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security 
</pre>
 
You can have multiple installation of  !GridFTP servers located on  the nodes you have 
specified in !BeStMan-gateway configuration. 
You will need to make sure that users have write permission in to the storage area.  




 
---++ Start the system 
You have to be root to start each service. You have to start all the components in the 
following order (this is order is optional but seems logical): 
   1. Start !BeStMan  (!GridFtp and Gratia transfer probe). Login on !BeStMan node, then:<pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –on 
</pre> 
 

---++ Stop the system 
You have to be root to stop each service. You have to stop all the components in the 
following order (this is order is optional but seems logical): 
 
   1. Stop !BeStMan (!GridFtp and Gratia transfer probe). Login on !BeStMan node, then: <pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –off  
</pre>
  
 
---++ System sanity check 
In order to verify that the system is functional you may use LBNL srm client that is installed with !BeStMan or if you want to install srm-client on different node you will need to download it from %CACHE%:

<pre class="screen">
mkdir /opt/%CACHE%_wn_client 
cd  /opt/%CACHE%_wn_client 
pacman pacman -get %CACHE%:wn_client 
. setup.sh 
</pre>


Follow the instructions provided in _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README_ to configure CA package updates.

You will need to get your voms-proxy certificate: 
<pre class="screen">
voms-proxy-init –voms &lt;voname&gt;:/&lt;voname&gt; 
</pre>

Execute srm-ping: 
<pre class="screen">
 srm-ping srm://<BeStMan_host>:8443/srm/v2/server 
 </pre>

Expected results: 
<pre class="screen">
