Note:  This page refers to the ldapsearch command.  The ldapsearch command is not part of the standard OSG installation, it is commonly
on many standard linux installations. If you do not have it and would like to get it
from the VDT it is part of the VDT OpenLDAP package that can be pulled using pacman
and refer to the VDT Package 'OpenLDAP.'

The definition of a validated, interoperable Storage Element (SE) will not be final until the OSG 1.0 cycle.  The following steps are the bare minimum required to validate a Compute Element (CE).

   * Site admins can verify the following:
      1. Does their site show up in the ITB BDII? <br> =ldapsearch -xLLL -h is-itb.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 -b o=grid '(<nop>GlueSiteDescription=*OSG*)' <nop>GlueSiteName | grep ^Glue=
      2. Does the site appear in http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_ldap_info_pps.cgi?
      3. Does the site show up in the EGEE PPS BDII? <br> =ldapsearch -xLLL -h pps-bdii.cern.ch -p 2170 -b o=grid '(<nop>GlueSiteDescription=*OSG*)' <nop>GlueSiteName | grep ^Glue= 

   * Interoperability staff can verify:
      1. Does the output from CEMon match what is served through the BDII?

   * If the above steps are validated, an OPS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo member with access to a gLite WN can verify the following:
      1. Does glite-job-list-match return the site if the sole requirement is <pre>other.GlueCEInfoHostName == "foo.bar.edu"</pre>
      2. Does a simple "hello world" job succeed submitted through the WMS?
<p>
Further tests to determine validation are currently being developed.
