Compute Element Authorization steps that must be taken before running OSG
Configuration Utility

---++Implement the Full Privilege Authorization Mode
Before running the OSG Configuration utility, you must select and configure an Authorization mode.  
There is no Authorization mode enabled by default.  It is strongly recommended that
you implement the Full Privilege authorization mode. Instructions on how to do so are below.

%INCLUDE{"FullPrivPreConfig"}%

If you do not wish to use Full Privilege, you may configure either [[LocalAuthPreConfig][Local Authorization]] or [[CompatibilityAuthPreConfig][Compatibility Mode Authorization]]  Both of these modes are strongly discouraged for use.

--++ Check supported VOs and Unix accounts
Beginning with OSG 0.6.0, one can verify that authorization works for the VOs supported and that the required Unix accounts exist on the CE host.  This is further discussed in the [[OsgSupportedVos][Supported VOs and Undefined UNIX Accounts]] topic.

--++  Monitoring and publishing the authorization service 
The authorization service configuration is monitored and published to the OSG information service (!CEMon, GIP, BDII) for all 3 modes:
   * it identifies your authorization mode as being either grid-mapfile based (Local and Compatibility modes) or GUMS based (Full Privilege mode)
   * for a Full Privilege (GUMS) based authorization service, it will periodically "probe" your GUMS service with an authorization request and report on the availability of the service.
This monitoring is automatically enabled on any %CACHE% CE node installation. 

On the GUMS service side for Full Privilege mode, GUMS v1.2 or later is required.  This is done automatically when upgrading GUMS to v1.2 or when doing a fresh GUMS v1.2 install.  If your GUMS version is not at this level, ask  your GUMS administrator to authorize a mapping for the information provider probe.  In case of problem, you can look at the manual version of the steps performed to authorize the authorization probe on the GUMS server at the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/notes/GUMS.html][VDT GUMS release notes]].
