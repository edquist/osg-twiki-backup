---++ Intro

This page is for comments and revisions of the questions that configure-osg-gip.sh asks.  The goal of this page is to have the most clear questions possible.

---++ SRM Information

Do you want to publish your srm information through GIP (Y/n): [n]

---++ GUMS Monitoring

<verbatim>
Information status of GUMS Service
----------------------------------
Would you like to publish the status of the GUMS server that you may have
  - http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.0/notes/GUMS.html

Do you want to publish your gums status through GIP (Y/n): [n]
</verbatim>

---++ SRM Information
This section consists of questions that are used to configure GIP, so that it can accurately publish information about SRM SE accessible from this CE.  
   local directory (cms): cms
   local directory (cdf): cdf/store
   local directory (evilvo): UNAVAILABLE

Do you want to use a simplified version where all supported VOs will be assigned the same local directory (Y/n): [y]

</verbatim>

---++++ Simplified Option
All VOs have same access points 

<verbatim>
What is the local directory for all VOs [UNAVAILABLE] ? 
</verbatim>

---++++ Detailed Option
This option allows admin to specify which VOs have access to the SE as well as assign separate access points to each of them. 
<verbatim>
What is the local directory for this vo, grow [UNAVAILABLE]?
</verbatim>
You will get this question for each VO. If the local directory is set to <verbatim>UNAVAILABLE</verbatim> then that VO does not have access to this SE.

---++++ Next step
This step allows you to specify a standalone gsiftp SE in addition to the SRM SE.
%NOTE% This SE is not (usually) a gridftp door, because publishing the gridftp door as a standalone SE will encourage users to directly access this SE defeating the purpose of SRM.
<verbatim>
In addition to the SRM server, would you like to advertise a gsiftp server? (Y/n): [Y]
</verbatim>

---++ GSIFTP Installation

This is the section where GIP gets configured to publish a gsiftp server 
%NOTE% This information is about standalone gsiftp server that is intended for direct access by users and (generally) not a gsiftp door or SRM/dcache. 

<verbatim>
Information about your gsiftp server
------------------------------------
gsiftp Storage Element:  A server providing an access point to data

Access Path:  The directory available on the gsiftp Storage Element

Note:  If you do not have a seperate Storage Element and your Compute Element
has a gsiftp server, enter your Compute Element hostname for gsiftp SE and the
access path on your CE.

Please enter SE where gsiftp is running: [grow-prod.its.uiowa.edu]
Please enter the Access Path on grow-prod.its.uiowa.edu: [/grow/data-grid/data]
