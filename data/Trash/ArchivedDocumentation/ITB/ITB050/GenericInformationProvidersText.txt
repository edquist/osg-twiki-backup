---+ Guide to Generic Information Provider (GIP) Configuration Questions
%TOC%
This page is a guide to the questions that configure-osg-gip.sh asks.  The goal of this page is to clearly identify GIP questions asked during configuration.

---++ GUMS Monitoring
This determines if the site wants to publish their GUMS service status through GIP.
<verbatim>
Information status of GUMS Service
----------------------------------
Would you like to publish the status of the GUMS server that you may have
configured?  More information about how to properly setup monitoring can be
found at the following URL.
  - http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.0/notes/GUMS.html

Do you want to publish your gums status through GIP (Y/n): [n]
</verbatim>

---++ SRM Information
This section consists of questions that are used to configure GIP, so that it can accurately publish information about SRM SE accessible from this CE.  
<verbatim>
Information about a possible SRM storage element
------------------------------------------------
If an SRM (Storage Resource Management) Storage Element exists that you would
like to associate with this Compute Element, please answer 'Y'

Do you want to publish your SRM information through GIP (Y/n): [n]

What is the registered OSG  sitename of your SRM Storage Element? (e.g. UIOWA-ITB): [UNAVAILABLE]
What is the hostname of your SRM Storage Element? (e.g. rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu) : [UNAVAILABLE]
</verbatim>

---+++ SRM Mount Point Information
This section consists of question that allow GIP to publish mount points (specifically !GlueSARoot and !GlueSAPath) correctly for each VOs. It has a simplified option which allows admins to assign same access points to all VOs as well as a detailed option which allows admins to specify which VOs have access to the storage element as well as assign different access point for each of them.

<verbatim>
Information about mount points on the SRM Storage Element
---------------------------------------------------------
root directory:  The root directory is the base directory for all Virtual
Organizations (VOs).

local directory: The directory relative from the root directory.

simplified option: All Virtual Organizations will share the same local directory.

detailed option: Separate local directories can be entered for each
VO.  To deny a VO access to the SRM Storage Element use the value 'UNAVAILABLE'.

detailed example:  A site has the following paths for VOs on an SRM.
   cms -> /pnfs/example.edu/data/cms
   cdf -> /pnfs/example.edu/data/cdf/store
   evilvo -> (no access granted)

Will translate to:
   root directory: /pnfs/example.edu/data/
   local directory (cms): cms
   local directory (cdf): cdf/store
   local directory (evilvo): UNAVAILABLE

Do you want to use a simplified version where all supported VOs will be assigned the same local directory (Y/n): [y]

</verbatim>

---++++ Simplified Option
All VOs have same access points 

<verbatim>
What is the local directory for all VOs [UNAVAILABLE] ? 
</verbatim>

---++++ Detailed Option
This option allows admin to specify which VOs have access to the SE as well as assign separate access points to each of them. 
<verbatim>
What is the local directory for this vo, grow [UNAVAILABLE]?
</verbatim>
You will get this question for each VO. If the local directory is set to <verbatim>UNAVAILABLE</verbatim> then that VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo does not have access to this SE.

---+++ Next step
This step allows you to specify a standalone gsiftp SE in addition to the SRM SE.
%NOTE% This SE is not (usually) a gridftp door, because publishing the gridftp door as a standalone SE will encourage users to directly access this SE defeating the purpose of SRM.
<verbatim>
In addition to the SRM server, would you like to advertise a gsiftp server? (Y/n): [Y]
</verbatim>

---++ GSIFTP Installation

This is the section where GIP gets configured to publish a gsiftp server 
%NOTE% This information is about standalone gsiftp server that is intended for direct access by users and (generally) not a gsiftp door or SRM/dcache. 

<verbatim>
Information about your gsiftp server
------------------------------------
gsiftp Storage Element:  A server providing an access point to data

Access Path:  The directory available on the gsiftp Storage Element

Note:  If you do not have a seperate Storage Element and your Compute Element
has a gsiftp server, enter your Compute Element hostname for gsiftp SE and the
access path on your CE.

Please enter SE where gsiftp is running: [grow-prod.its.uiowa.edu]
Please enter the Access Path on grow-prod.its.uiowa.edu: [/grow/data-grid/data]
