---+++Installation Method
%EDITTHIS%

The installation and configuration method is based on [[PacmanInfo][Pacman]].  Pacman is a package manager like conceptually RPM or dpkg. It has a couple of advantages: it can be used as non-root (for client installations), and multiple installations can co-exist. It is also multiple platform. Specific Pacman directions are given below, and in the pre-installation procedures.
