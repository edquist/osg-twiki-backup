---+ Installing OSG with an SRM-based CE
%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

This section covers installing OSG with a CE based on SRM/DRM and SRM/dCache, and provides an overview of how each is incorporated into the OSG infrastructure. (Other SRM implementations are not covered here.) 

For a comprehensive description of these implementations, see the SRM/DRM or SRM/dCache documentation, or the [[http://srm.fnal.gov/][Fermilab SRM site]]. 

---++ Deploy SRM in _addition_ to Suggested Minimal Configuration
In principle, replacing =$OSG_DATA= in the [[InstallingOSGInMinimalSuggestedConfiguration][Minimal Suggested Configuration]] with either one of these SRM solutions is an OSG-compliant configuration as specified in the [[LcgModel][LCG model]] description. 

In practice, however, many applications are not ready to benefit from SRM. Thus, we recommend <!-- UPDATE FOR FUTURE RELEASES --> that sites deploy SRM in addition to the [[InstallingOSGInMinimalSuggestedConfiguration][Minimal Suggested Configuration]]. For example, a site might provide a small $OSG_DATA area (~100GB) in addition to a large, multi-TB SRM space.

---++ Implementing OSG Storage Using SRM/dCache
For applications that are able to use dcap, SRM/dCache replaces /osg/data.  [[SrmDcacheModel][The SRM/dCache Model discussion]] showcases an ideal workflow. 

%NOTE% For applications that are not yet able to use dcap, the [[LcgModel][LCG Model]] may be suitable.  However, a job's needed data must fit into WN_TMP, which often is quite small (~10GB). Therefore, we recommend that application developers and owners learn about dcap to benefit from the large storage available in SRM/dCache.

If you choose SRM/dCache configuration, configure the following:

| *Site read:* | dcap://mydcapnode.athome.edu:22136//pnfs/athome.edu |
| *Site write:* | srm://mysrmnode.athome.edu:8443/ | 
| *Default SE:* | gsiftp://myheadnode2.athome.edu:2811 | 

%WARNING% A file that is copied into the Default SE can not be read from "Site read" as these are two entirely different storage elements in this site configuration.

The specifications for "Site read" and "Site write" are chosen such that a user who knows their path inside the dCache pnfs logical namespace can add that path behind "Site read" or "Site write" without any additional or extraneous forward slashes.
