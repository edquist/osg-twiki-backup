This document is intended for administrators responsible for installing and configuring:%BR%

---++ Introduction

<!-- Instructions for installing a CE intended for the OSG version 0.4.0 Production grid can be found [[http://kb.grid.iu.edu/data/aths.html][here]]. -->

Move to after cert stuff (which is after ce install)

To install pacman, see [[PacmanInfo]].  Find pacman troubleshooting info there, too.  To just install it:
<verbatim>
> cd  [install directory]
> wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample.cache/tarballs/pacman-[version].tar.gz
</verbatim>
Where the pacman version appropriate for OSG 0.6.0 is 3.19. E.g.,:
<verbatim>
> wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample.cache/tarballs/pacman-3.19.tar.gz
</verbatim>

---++Installing the OSG Worker Node Client Package

This must be installed in a location visible to jobs executing on the worker node. Refer to the 
[[WorkerNodeClient][Worker Node Client]] Guide for additional information.

---++ Batch System
If you intend to use the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] system, install it from the VDT cache using pacman. You can do this before or after installing the CE package.  We strongly recommend to install Condor in a different directory than your main CE installation ($VDT_LOCATION), e.g., =/opt/condor=.   See Integration.CondorBatchSystemHints and Integration.MinimalCondorHints for more information  And see [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.8/3_2Installation.html][Condor installation instructions]]. (will change version, so link will need to change)

To pull Condor from the VDT cache, use:

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache:Condor</b>
</pre>

This runs a script; answer "y" to the yes/no questions. Install the CA files in the same place as for the CE install (usually "r" for /etc/grid-security/certificates is the right choice)

---+++ If Condor is installed outside $VDT_LOCATION
(Any pre-existing Condor installation will be outside this area.)

If you have installed Condor as your batch queuing system, you are required to set two environment variables so the Condor path is correctly configured. This will ensure that VDT middleware services point to appropriate locations in your external Condor installation.

If you first source the Condor setup script, it will set the variables CONDOR_LOCATION and CONDOR_CONFIG and CONDOR_ROOT.  You can use these in the following variable definitions if you like. Afterwards you will have to source the VDT setup script to reset variables. 

   * *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION* - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. =/opt/condor=). The Condor =bin/=, =bin=, =etc/=, =lib/=... directories should be directly under this location. (E.g., =export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_LOCATION=) This will preserve a Condor installed in the standard location.
   * *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG* (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is =$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config=.

Go back to $VDT_LOCATION and source the setup script there.

---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to  [[OsgCEAuthorization][Osg CE Authorization]] document and authorize other users before performing the *OSG Registration* of your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!).  You should do this before doing the rest of the monitoring configuration steps below, otherwise you may  have to repeat the steps later, particularly if your site is using GUMS.
