---++ Batch System
If you intend to use the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] system, install it from the VDT cache using pacman. You can do this before or after installing the CE package.  We strongly recommend to install Condor in a different directory than your main CE installation ($VDT_LOCATION), e.g., =/opt/condor=.   See Integration.CondorBatchSystemHints and Integration.MinimalCondorHints for more information  And see [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.8/3_2Installation.html][Condor installation instructions]]. (will change version, so link will need to change)

---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to  [[OsgCEAuthorization][Osg CE Authorization]] document and authorize other users before performing the *OSG Registration* of your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!).  You should do this before doing the rest of the monitoring configuration steps below, otherwise you may  have to repeat the steps later, particularly if your site is using GUMS.

Instructions and configuration of WS-GRAM can be viewed [[InstallAndConfigureGlobusWebServices][here]].
