---+ Planning Discussions for OSG 0.6.0
%TOC%

---++ Introduction

This section is included for historical purposes - it contains preliminary discussions that led to this release of the ITB.
   * January OSG consortium meeting slides on OSG 0.6.0 [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=340][here]].
   * [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=382][NFS-lite]] document by Terrence Martin
   * ITB Pacman cache, for inspection http://software.grid.iu.edu/itb/


---++ VO requirements
We need an applications matrix to discuss specific VO requirements for 0.6.0.  Information that has been given:
   * See Integration.AtlasWishList060
   * CDF has a specific request for Squid. %Y%

---++ Backgroud discussions
   * [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A1=ind0606e&L=osg-int&O=T&H=0&D=0&T=1#2][On required services and what constitutes a default CE]]
   * [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?A1=ind0607a&L=osg-int&O=T&H=0&D=0&T=1#1][MIS job manager and hung processes cleanup]]

---++ Handling incremental facility upgrades
It is expected the upgrade to OSG 0.6.0 will need to be performed incrementally, not all sites upgrading at the same time, and perhaps upgrading their services one at a time.  This will additionally have implications on the ITB, but also for the deployed production OSG facility.

Questions:
   * How to characterize a site's provided services?
   * How to publish, disseminate plans for these upgrades (deployments), so as to set VO expectations.


---++ Policy
Need to revisit the description and publication of site and VO policies.
   * Site policy templates
   * VO policy templates


---++ Compute Element
The following is taken from slides at the Florida OSG consortium meeting (1/06):
<pre>
AAA based on RBAC with certs from VOMS.
GLUE schema 1.2
Possibly extensions for storage
Version 2 not likely before LHC startup.
Plans for June 06:
No ws as part of baseline services in LCG
New RB using condor-c is part of this release. Not clear how 
exactly this will be deployed. Will figure this out between now 
and May!
Concern about interoperability!
Gt4 pre-ws -> ok
Gt4 ws
Condor-c
</pre>



---++ Edge Services
   * [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/EdgeServices/Integration.WebHome][Edge Services twiki]]


---++ glexec
   * Talk from EGEE: [[http://infn-ecgi.pi.infn.it/documentation/glexec.pdf][(pdf)]]
   * Installing and using glexec found [[http://grid.pd.infn.it/cream/field.php?n=AndConf.Guide][here]].


---++ Storage and Data
   * Integration.DiskResourceManager and SrmDrm
   * LocalStorageRequirements - definitions and usage conventions of storage releated environmentals for an OSG installation.
   * LocalStorageConfiguration
   * UsingLocalStorage
   * Integration.DrmUserNotes - notes from Ransom


---++ Facilities
   * [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=382][Document on NFS-lite]] - description of steps and procedures for removing NFS dependencies at UCSD.
