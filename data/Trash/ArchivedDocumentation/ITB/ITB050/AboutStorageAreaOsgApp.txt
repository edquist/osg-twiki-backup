---+ About the OSG_APP Storage Area
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%
The OSG_APP storage agea holds VO-wide software installations.

Relative paths must be consistent between gatekeeper and worker nodes, even if the base OSG_APP directory differ. However, we strongly recommend making the base directory the same in both. Failing to do so may mean that some legacy software<sup>[[#Foot1Table2][1]]</sup> will not function properly.  

This area may be writable only by a subset of users and read-only for all the others: there is no guarantee that every user will have write access.  OSG_APP must point to a POSIX-compliant filesystem for software installation. 

To improve basic security and robustness, we recommend that only specific users and/or VO roles have write access to OSG_APP. <sup>[[#Foot2Table2][2]]</sup>

---+++ Typical uses of OSG_APP
   * Install and run VO applications

---+++ Notes:
   1. <a name="Foot1Table2"></a>Pacman resolves variables an symbolic links saving the full real path. The following may help you avoid problems with it:
      * Choose any absolute location on your gatekeeper file system for OSG_APP.
      * On each worker node arrange by mount or symlink that OSG_APP has the same path as on the gatekeeper node.
      * Install applications only using the fork jobmanager.
   1. <a name="Foot2Table2"></a>We recommend enabling the 'sticky bit' on OSG_APP for all shared CE storages.

<!-- Furthermore, many shared filesystems trust the integrity of the clients; a compromised client may compromise all of OSG_APP if NFS write access is allowed. The mechanisms to recognize a sw manager role (FQAN) and send only it to the APP server with the possibility of installing software are currently missing in OSG and will require some software development.
