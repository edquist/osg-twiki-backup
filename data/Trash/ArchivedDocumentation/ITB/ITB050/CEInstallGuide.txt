---+++GRIS ldap server
<OL>
  <LI>(Main.JohnWeigand - 06 Sep 2006) - The GRIS slapd daemon dies periodically.

          This is loosely related to and documented in  <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=2003">VDT ticket 2003</a> 
          and <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&pass=guest&q=2076">VDT ticket 2076</a>.

          If the LDAP server is accessed at a high rate, it appears to just quietly die.  I discovered that my node was on this 
          <a href="http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_ldap_info.cgi">registery list</a> advertising port 2135.  This caused my node  to take in
          excess of 20K hits from 85+ sites per day (not even a full day as the daemon kept dying).  Those sites using BDII on port 2170 do not 
          suffer this problem.

          The problem with the <i>sladp</i> daemon dying is that it also functions as a cron-like process that runs the <i>osg-info-wrapper</i> script 
           that the <i>configure_gip</i> script creates to collect GLUE schema data.

    <b>Resolution</b>: None, other than do not get your LDAP server put on the registery list mentioned above.

---+++Globus web services
<OL>
  <LI>(Main.JohnWeigand - 06 Sep 2006) - <nop>SocketTimeoutException in container-real.log
    <br>Refer to <a href="http://www.globus.org/mail_archive/discuss/2006/09/msg00011.html">Globus <nop>discuss@globus.org thread of Sep 6 2006</a> for more information.

          <pre>

          </pre>

   This pretty much stops the container from processing any requests.  The client process will hang and time out.

    <b>Resolution</b>: From Jarek Gawor (gawor@mcs.anl.gov) on 9/6/06 -
                                These 'timed out' exceptions can indicate a number of problems (e.g. regular
                                networking issues) but in some cases it might indicate a deadlock condition.
                                So whenever you see these errors do 'kill -QUIT <jvm process>' on the
                               container process. That should force the JVM to dump its thread state into
                               the container log file. Send that thread dump to me or the list.

  <LI>(Main.JohnWeigand - 06 Sep 2006) - <nop>NoSuchResourceException in container-real.log<br>
          <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4684">Globus 4.0.2 bugzilla ticket 4684</a>

                     org.globus.wsrf.NoSuchResourceException
          </pre>

          <b>Resolution</b>: This does not appear to be a problem with web services.  It is just a mis-leading message in terms of it being an ERROR.
          The web services processes should work fine.

The GIP is automatically configured during the configure-osg.sh. See the 
[[GenericInformationProviders050][Generic Information Providers]] document for details.

---+++ Configure MIS-CI

%RED%For OSG-ITB 0.5.1/VDT 1.4.0 and greater, MIS-CI is no longer part of the OSG CE package and
there is nothing to configure, skip all  the MIS-CI instructions below.%ENDCOLOR%
 
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (MIS-CI) provides 
information on the site environment and computing resources. The OSG-CE package includes MIS-CI. 
This section describes how to configure MIS-CI if you wish to enable it.
%INCLUDE{"CENodeCEMon"}%
The $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/configure-misci.sh script performs the configuration. It
creates or adds a crontab for the MIS-CI information collectors. The Unix account for the MIS-CI scripts should be <b>mis</b>. By default, the script assumes the !GridCat DN is mapped to the ivdgl user.  You will need to use the <b>--choose_user</b> option to change to <b>mis</b>.
<pre>

MIS-CI is collecting information using crontab as the user mis (or ivdgl if you left it as the default). Therefore, in order to stop
MIS-CI processes, crontab should be removed. The script $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh
is provided for this purpose:
<pre>
      &gt;  cd $VDT_LOCATION
      &gt;  source setup.(c)sh
      &gt;  cd MIS-CI
      &gt;  ./uninstall-misci.sh
</pre>

After finishing configuring the MIS-CI, a few checks might be necessary:
<OL>
<LI> Verify the crontab was created for the <i>mis</i> user.
 <pre>
      &gt;  crontab -u mis -l
</pre>
<LI> If you want to force an MIS-CI table update (due to fresh install or update), then as the MIS-CI user (<i>mis</i>), execute:
<pre>
   &gt;  $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh
</pre>
<LI>  As a non-root user, verify that at least one table is filled.<br>
           <b>If you chose not to force an update, it might take 10 minutes or so before the tables are filled with current information.</b>

---+++ Configure MDS (GRIS)
The Globus information system is called MDS and is pre-configured to read the osg-attributes.conf information file.   

The configuration script (<i>VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_mds</i>) is executed automatically during the initial download with default values   It also install the <i>gris</i> daemon as an /etc/rc.d service.  

The <i>gris</i> daemon should have been started as a part of the initial installation.  To verify:
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww |grep ldap

</pre>
If it is not running, you will need to restart it:
<pre>
<b>Usage:</b>
   &gt; /etc/init.d/gris  [start | stop ]
</pre>

<p>
The GRIS by default logs to syslog facility local4.  You can create a log of who is accessing your 
GRIS by adding the following to /etc/syslog.conf (on redhat-like machines):  
<pre>
local4.*                                                /var/log/slapd.log
</pre>
<p>
MDS should be configured for anonymous bind.  You can  send a test query to your local host which will perform no authentication on the user submitting the request .  First, verify you have no proxy certificate (/tmp/x509u_(your_PID)).  If one exists,  remove it first.  Then, 
<pre>
&gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  grid-info-search -anonymous
<i>... your screen should scroll for a while showing a lot of data... 
....you can redirect the output to validate</i>
</pre>


---++Activate Your Site
The <nop>GridCat system maintains status and other information on all OSG sites as can be viewed 
<a href="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">here</a>. 

Sites added to <nop>GridCat are presumed to be inactive if a site state bit is not set to be 1 (see below).
<UL>
<LI><b>Inactive</b> sites will have the site status dot with the grey color. 
<LI> Once the site becomes <b>active</b>, the site status dot will become either green or red, depending on the 
<a href="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">GridCat test results </a>.
</UL>

Since the default site state is presumed to be inactive, the CE site administrator  has to pro-actively switch the site state to be active.

For OSG 0.5.0 and prior releases, modify the file <i>$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info</i>. and set the value to 1 for the variable below:
<pre>
  export grid_site_state_bit =  1
</pre>
      
For OSG 0.5.1+, the MIS-CI services are deprecated with this release.  The new file for maintaining the site state information is <i>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid-site-state-info</i>.  The deprecated <i>$VDT_LOCATION/<b>MIS-CI</b>/etc/grid-site-state-info</i> will be symlinked to the new file in the <i>./monitoring</i> directory.  This new file will only contain the single variable:
<pre>
  export grid_site_state_bit =  1
</pre>
To activate/deactivate your site, a <i>site-status</i> script has been provided.
<pre>
&gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/site-status  on|off
where
   [on]      Set site to accept jobs
   [off]     Set site as offline
</pre>


<b>NOTE: It might take up to 2 hours for registered sites to take effect in the !GridCat display. If your site is not registered with the OSG-GOC see the instructions in the 
<a href="#OSG_Registration">OSG Registration section</a> of this document. Until your site is registered, it will not appear in 
<a href="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">GridCat</a></b>

If your site decides to become inactive for various reasons, e.g., site maintenance, the site administrator should execute the <i>site-status</i> script.

As you install, monitor the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log.  

   * If pacman tries to retrieve something from a website that's having problems, you'll get an error message that's unrelated to the real problem because pacman can't recognize 404 errors when downloading tarballs.  For example, when the PRIMA download site was down, it told us the file wasn't in the correct format:
