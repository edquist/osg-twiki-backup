---++ Simple Test of the CE Node (using local grid mapfile)
%EDITTHIS%
d32 1
The first step is to configure the CE to allow access using your own Grid credentials. (See the [[CertScripts#FAQ][Personal Certificates FAQ]] for more.) Once that's done you'll be able to run local tests and verify operation of your CE locally.

Make sure you have a grid proxy for yourself. This is based on your certificate:

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>source VDT_LOCATION/setup.(c)sh</b>
 > <b>grid-proxy-init</b>
   <em>(you will be prompted for your GRID pass phrase)</em>
</pre>
   
Then, to get the subject (DN) of your proxy, run: 

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>grid-proxy-info -identity</b>
 > <b>grid-proxy-info -subject</b>
   <em>Output....</em>
   /DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Dane Skow/UID=dane
</pre>

Take the subject string and pre-pend it to the =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= and assign it to a local user account (you can use any of the VO accounts you've created at the beginning to test). So the grid-mapfile should have at least one entry like:

<pre class="programlisting">
"/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Dane Skow/UID=dane" usatlas1
</pre>

This is enough to enable the rest of the installation testing.

---+++ Simple Test of Fork Queue
Using the grid proxy you just created, you can test the Globus gatekeeper fork queue by executing:

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>globus-job-run $(hostname):2119/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id</b> 
   <em>Output....</em>
   uid=9872(usatlas1) gid=9872(usatlas1) groups=9872(usatlas1)
</pre>

You should see the UNIX user account assigned  based on the =gridmap-file= you created previously..

You can also view the =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= to see the authorization messages:

<pre class="programlisting">
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 6: Got connection 131.225.207.100 at Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 5: Authenticated globus user:    <b>/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=People/CN=Dane Skow/UID=dane</b>

   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 0: GRID_SECURITY_HTTP_BODY_FD=7
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 5: <b>Requested service: jobmanager-fork</b>
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 5: <b>Authorized as local user: usatlas1</b>
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 5: <b>Authorized as local uid: 9872</b>
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 5:           <b>and local gid: 9872</b>
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 0: executing /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/libexec/globus-job-manager

   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 0: GRID_SECURITY_CONTEXT_FD=10
  TIME: Sun Jan  8 23:12:43 2006
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 0: Child 29808 started
</pre>

---+++ Simple Test Of The  Job Manager Queue
Now you can test the Globus gatekeeper job submissions for the job manager queue you are using. The example below is for the Condor job manager.

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>globus-job-run $(hostname):2119/jobmanager-condor /usr/bin/id</b> 
   <em>Output....</em>
   uid=9872(usatlas1) gid=9872(usatlas1) groups=9872(usatlas1)
</pre>

You should see the same results as with the fork queue submission.

The =globus-gatekeeper.log= file will look identical except for the "Request service" message:

<pre>
   PID: 29703 -- Notice: 5: Requested service: jobmanager-condor
</pre>

---+++ Simple Test Of GSIFTP Services

A simple test of the gsiftp services requires creating a simple file and then copying it from one location on your machine tothe default storage element available for your CE. When you [[CEInstallGuide#Configuring_the_OSG_Attributes][configured your OSG attributes]], you defined a default SE as a shared storage space with read-write access for all users. We will use this as the destination directory for the file we are copying.

Create a temporary file to be copied:

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>echo "My test gsiftp file" > /tmp/gsiftp.test</b>
</pre>

Copy the file to the $OSG_DATA directory:

<pre class="screen">
> <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-attributes.conf</b>  <em># Just to get the OSG_DATA variable</em>
> <b>globus-url-copy file:/tmp/gsiftp.test gsiftp://$(hostname)${OSG_DATA}/gsiftp.test</b>
</pre>

Verify the file was copied to the $OSG_DATA directory:

<pre class="screen">
> <b>ls -l  $OSG_DATA/gsiftp.test</b>
 -rw-r--r--  1 usatlas1 usatlas1  20 Jan  9 13:29 /storage/local/data1/osg/OSG.DIRS/data/gsiftp.test
</pre>

To verify the accounting information was captured, you can view the =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp.log= for the ftp copy operation you just performed.  You should see an entry similar to this for the transfer statistics collected by various systems like !Integration.MonALISA and ACDC:

<pre>
   <b>DATE=20060110211714.329666</b> HOST=cmssrv09.fnal.gov PROG=globus-gridftp-server NL.EVNT=FTP_INFO START=20060110211714.247555 <b>USER=ivdgl </b>FILE=/tmp/gridcat-gsiftp-test.gridcat.21602.remote BUFFER=0 BLOCK=262144 <b>NBYTES=28 </b>VOLUME=/ STREAMS=1 STRIPES=1 DEST=[129.79.4.64] TYPE=RETR CODE=226
</pre>

The authorization and other informational messages are captured in the =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/log/gridftp-auth.log= :

<pre>
   [2834] Tue Jan 10 15:21:37 2006 :: Server started in inetd mode.
