%EDITTHIS%

This section is intended to describe the information you will need available to configure your OSG CE node. It will also provide some general guidelines for your physical configuration of hosts and file systems.  A more detailed description of all of the osg attributes can be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/OSGConfigurationParameters][here]].

You will be prompted for this information by the =OSG_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.sh= script after the software is installed.


| *GENERAL INFORMATION* ||
| *OSG Group* | Identifies the monitoring group that your site is participating in. Values are  %BB% _OSG_ - For Production %BB% _OSG-ITB_ - For the integration testbed |
| *Resource Name* | _See_ OSGResourceName |
| *Sponsors* | The VO sponsors for your site.  For example: usatlas, ivdgl, ligo, uscms, sdss... You must express the percentage of sponsorship using the following notation: %BR% =myvo:50 yourvo:10 anothervo:20 local:20= |
| *Policy URL* | The URL for the document describing the usage policy/agreement for this resource. |
 |*CONTACT INFORMATION* ||
| *Contact name* | The site administrator's full name. |
| *Contact email* | The site adminstrator's email address. |
| *SERVER LOCATION* ||
| *City* | The city your server is located in or near. |
| *Country* | The country your server is located in. |
| *Longitude/Latitude* | For your city. This  will determine your placement on any world maps used for monitoring.  You can find some approximate values for your geographic location from http://geotags.com/ or you can search your location on [[http://www.google.com][Google]]. For the USA, %BB% latitude  is about   29 (South)       ...  48 (North) %BB% longitude is about -123 (West coast) ... -71 (East coast) |
| *LOCAL STORAGE INFORMATION* ||
|| _These variables define various storage locations available on your site for jobs.  The are described in detail in the a separate [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] document._ |
| *GRID* | Location where the OSG WN Client (wn-client.pacman) has  been installed. |
| *APP* | Typically used to store the applications which will run on this gatekeeper. |
| *DATA* | Typically used to hold output from jobs while it is staged out to a Storage Element. |
| *WN_TMP* | Used to hold input and output from jobs on a worker node where the application is executing. |
| *Storage Element (SE)* | This is the Storage Element (SE) that is visible from all worker nodes accessible via this server (CE). It may be a SE local or close to the CE that is preferred as destination SE if the job does not have other preferences. |
| *SITE_READ* | Used to stage-in input for jobs using a Storage Element or for persistent storage between jobs.  It may be the mount point of a dCache SE accessed read-only using dcap. |
| *SITE_WRITE* | Used to store to a Storage Element output from jobs or forpersistent storage between jobs.  It may be the mount point of a dCache SE accessed write-only using dcap. |
| *<nop>Trash/Trash/Integration.MonALISA MONITORING INFORMATION* ||
|| _This information will only be required if you intend to activate [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA][Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA]]._ |
| *Ganglia host* | The host machine ganglia is running on. _(If ganglia is being used to monitor your cluster)_ |
| *Ganglia port* | The host machine's port ganglia is using. _(If ganglia is being used to monitor your cluster)_ |
| *VO Modules* | If =y=, will activate the VO Modules module in the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA][Trash.ReleaseDocumentationMonALISA]] configuration file. |
| *<nop>Trash/Trash/Integration.Squid WEB PROXY SERVER* ||
|| The following questions only get asked if you indicate that you want to use squid when running configure-osg.sh |
| *Squid Location* | The host machine that squid is running on.  This is usually a since machine for the cluster that has sufficient memory and disk space to cache incoming and outgoing web traffic and store any file that clients may download. |
| *Memory Cache Size* | The amount of memory that squid should use for caching downloads and files.  This may be temporarily exceeded if squid is proxying a very large download.  Setting this to more than 512MB should improve download performance significantly. |
| *Disk Cache Size* | The amount of disk space that squid should use for storing cached objects.  This should be set to a value larger than 2-3GB  for optimum benefits. |
| *<nop>Trash/Trash/Integration.GIP GENERIC INFORMATION PROVIDER INFORMATION* ||
| *SE Sitename* | This is the registered OSG sitename for the SE that is being used for the cluster _(If an SE is available)_ |
| *SE Hostname* | The hostname for the SE that is being used for the cluster _(If an SE is available)_ |
| *Root directory* | The full path to the root directory of the se (e.g. /pnfs/osgsite.edu/data |
| *Local directories* | The directory paths relative to the root directory for each vo to use on the SE.  This is either a single path if the simplified option is used or a path for each VO will be requested if the simplified option is not choosen. |
| *GSIFTP server* | The hostname for a gsiftp server associated with the cluster (the hostname of the CE can be used if there is no dedicated gsiftp server) |
| *Access Path* | The access path to use with the gsiftp server. |
