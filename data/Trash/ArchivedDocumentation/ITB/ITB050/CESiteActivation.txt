---+!! CE Site Activation

%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%

---++ Activate Your Site
%EDITTHIS%

The [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/][Integration.GridCat system]] maintains status and other information on all OSG sites. 

Sites added to <nop>Integration.GridCat are presumed to be inactive if a site state bit is not set to be 1 (see below).
   * *Inactive* sites will have a gray site status dot. 
   * Once the site becomes *active*, the site status dot will become either green or red, depending on the 
[[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/][Integration.GridCat test results]].


Since the default site state is presumed to be inactive, the CE site administrator  has to pro-actively switch the site state to be active.

For OSG 0.5.0 and prior releases, modify the file =$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info=. and set the value to 1 for the variable below:

<pre>
 export grid_site_state_bit =  1
</pre>
      
For OSG 0.5.1+, the MIS-CI services are deprecated with this release.  The new file for maintaining the site state information is =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid-site-state-info=.  The deprecated =$VDT_LOCATION/<b>MIS-CI</b>/etc/grid-site-state-info= will be symlinked to the new file in the =./monitoring= directory.  This new file will only contain the single variable:

<pre>
 export grid_site_state_bit =  1
</pre>

Use the provided =site-status= script to activate/deactivate your site.
<pre class="screen">
$ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
$ <b>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/site-status  <replaceable>on|off</replaceable></b>
</pre>

where:
| =on= | Set site to accept jobs |
| =off= | Set site as offline |



%NOTE% It might take up to two hours for registered sites to take effect in the !Integration.GridCat display. If your site is not registered with the OSG-GOC see the instructions in the [[ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.CEInstallGuide#OSG_Registration][OSG Registration section]]. Until your site is registered, it will not appear in [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/][Integration.GridCat]].

If your site decides to become inactive for various reasons, e.g., site maintenance, the site administrator should execute the <i>site-status</i> script.
