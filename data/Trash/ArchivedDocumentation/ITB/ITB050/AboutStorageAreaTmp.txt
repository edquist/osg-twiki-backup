---+ About the TMP Storage Area

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

The TMP storage area was intended as a shared temporary work area. Because of its similarities with OSG_DATA, the reduced interest in multimode applications (that anyway can use OSG_DATA), and the possibility of the application abusing of a shared space, this *has been removed* in the most recent OSG version.
