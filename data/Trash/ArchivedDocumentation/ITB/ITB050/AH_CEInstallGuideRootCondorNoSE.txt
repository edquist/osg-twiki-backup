---+!!<nop>OSG CE 0.6.n Installation Instructions, Install as root, use Condor, do not have an SE

This document is intended for administrators responsible for installing and configuring:%BR%
   *OSG Compute Element (CE) version 0.6.0 ff onto OSG ITB or OSG Resources*
<!--
*%RED%As of 29 May 07, this document has only been tested by its author (or "adapter", rather). But it worked for her!%ENDCOLOR%* -->
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%

---++ Introduction and Assumptions
Assumptions:
   * You are installing as root.
      * Paraphrasing from the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/installation_think.html][VDT site]]: If you install as root, the VDT's programs can be made available to all the users on your system. Additionally, the VDT will be able to configure and start some of the grid services you might be installing.  Some services can only be run if you are root. 
      * Corollary: If you don't install as root, you CAN'T do these things.
      * But do not install anything under the =/root= directory!
   * You know how to setup and administer a cluster, if needed.  You don't?  Start with [[SiteFabricBestPractices]]. (We don't provide full documentation on this.)
   * You will use [[PacmanInfo][Pacman]] to install (more info, see [[OSGInstallationMethod][OSG Installation Method]])
   * You are installing onto a [[OperatingSystems][supported operating system]]
   * You have a Condor installation on your machine, in a location different from where you plan to install the OSG CE software.
   * You plan to install Full Privilege for authorization (implements the PRIMA authorization module with GUMS and does not use the grid-mapfile)
   * You have thought about the configuration values needed (OSG group, resource name, server location, local storage locations, and so on).  You haven't?  See [[CESiteAdminGuide]] and [[LocalStorageConfiguration]].

This document is not meant as an all-inclusive guide to Grid computing (or to CE installation, for that matter) and includes only the above-mentioned options for configuring a CE. 
   * To see what's included in this OSG CE release, see [[AH_CESoftWare][CE Installed Software]]. 
   * To see only updates that appear in the current release of the OSG CE software stack, see [[CEReleaseChanges]].
   * If you're interested, see [[VdtReleaseNotes][VDT Release Notes]].
   * For troubleshooting during/after installation, see [[CEInstallTroubleShooting]].
   * If you need assistance during any portion of the installation, see [[InstallationAssistance][Installation Assistance]].
If you have issues with things like compilers, network, firewall, time sync, DNS, and so on, see [[AH_CEPreInstallationChecklist]].

---++ Conventions used in this page
In this document, all commands are issued as =root= unless specified otherwise.  Reference the [[OsgConventions][Conventions]] as needed.

---++ Install and Setup Pacman
Choose a location for installing pacman.  It should be different from the directory in which you will install the OSG CE package.  

Install the [[ReleaseDocumentation/CEInstallGuide#Installing_and_Setting_Up_Pacman][right version of pacman]], according to the OSG software version.
The installation command looks like this (use the right version): %RED%Link to table showing pacman version vs OSG version%ENDCOLOR%
<pre class="screen">
# wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-<i><b>version</b></i>.tar.gz
</pre>
Where the pacman version appropriate for OSG 0.6.0 is 3.19. Here's what you'd enter for this version:
<pre class="screen">
# cd  [install directory]
# wget http://physics.bu.edu/pacman/sample_cache/tarballs/pacman-3.19.tar.gz
</pre>
Continue with unpacking and setting up, e.g.:
<pre class="screen">
# tar --no-same-owner -xzvf pacman-3.19.tar.gz
# cd pacman-3.19
</pre>
Source the setup script there, appropriately for your shell. Now the pacman location is fixed in your $PATH (if you move the pacman directory, and you re-source this script, it won't fix the $PATH).

For examples, troubleshooting, and more information, see [[PacmanInfo]].
 
---++ Pre-installation Checklist
<!-- %INCLUDE{"AH_CEPreInstallationChecklist"}%
-->
Some items are mentioned under "Assumptions", above. First, refer there.  Next, if you haven't yet installed Condor, do so now. 
   * If you're reinstalling it, first shut down the previous version, then remove it.
   * Pick an install directory different from where you're going to install the OSG CE software, and =cd= to it. 
   * Use pacman to install Condor (shown for VDT 1.6.1):
<pre class="screen">
# pacman -get http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/vdt_161_cache:Condor
</pre>
      * Answer =y= when asked about trusting the caches and agreeing to license. 
      * Condor has to run under owner _daemon_. %RED%True? Or user "condor" if it exists?%ENDCOLOR% Make sure _daemon_ can write to the installation area.
      * Answer =y= to Condor running automatically.
      * Respond =r= when asked where to install the CA files.
      * See [[CondorBatchSystemHints]].  
   * Define and export the variable VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION to point to your Condor installation (i.e., the directory directly above bin, etc, lib, and so on): 
<pre class="screen">
# export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=<i>/my/condor/location/</i>
</pre>
   * Define and export the variable VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG to point to your Condor config file (i.e., =$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config=): 
<pre class="screen">
# export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG=$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config
</pre>
   * To save yourself some steps later on in the privilege configuration, set the variable VDT_GUMS_HOST to your GUMS host now.  For example:
<pre class="screen">
# export VDT_GUMS_HOST=<i>mygumshost.domain</i>
</pre>
   * If you plan to use Squid, a web caching service that speeds up downloads from http servers, install it on a separate host from the OSG CE software. Install it *before* you proceed with the CE installation. To install Squid run:
<pre class="screen">
<i> Remember, on separate machine! </i>
# cd <i> your/squid/install/dir </i>
# pacman -get OSG:squid
</pre>
To learn more, see [[CESquidInstallation]].



---++ Installing the OSG Worker Node Client Package

This must be installed in a location visible to jobs executing on the worker node. Refer to the 
[[WorkerNodeClient][Worker Node Client]] Guide for information. 
<!-- Anne did not go through this spring/summer 07 -->

%INCLUDE{"AH_CEInstallingServicesRootCondorNoSE"}%
To see what version of the OSG CE software you've installed and what services came along, run:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
# <b>./osg-version </b>
 and
# <b>vdt-version </b>
</pre>
For more info, see [[AH_CESoftWareDiscover]]. (Note that the GUMS client gets installed with the CE, but does not show up on this list.)

---++ Obtain and Configure PKI Certificates
You will have to obtain at least a host certificate and possibly others.  For testing purposes later on, you'll need a personal certificate, too.  The [[AH_CEConfigurePKI]] document takes you through the process. If you already have these certificates, it tells you where to copy them and what permissions to give them.  Ignoring your personal certificate, here's what you want to end up with:
<pre class="screen">
<i>... in /etc/grid-security ...</i>
-r--r--r--    1 root     root         1469 May 15 16:44 hostcert.pem
-r--------    1 root     root         1679 May 15 16:46 hostkey.pem
drwxr-xr-x    2 daemon   daemon       4096 May 15 16:50 http
drwxr-xr-x    2 daemon   daemon       4096 May 15 16:48 ldap

<i>... in /etc/grid-security/ldap ...</i>
-r--r--r--    1 daemon   daemon       1473 May 15 16:48 ldapcert.pem
-r--------    1 daemon   daemon       1675 May 15 16:48 ldapkey.pem

<i>... in /etc/grid-security/http ...</i>
-r--r--r--    1 daemon   daemon       1473 May 15 16:50 httpcert.pem
-r--------    1 daemon   daemon       1679 May 15 16:50 httpkey.pem
</pre>

%RED% From Siddhartha:
If exp'd gridadmin: grid interface website, submit request on your behalf, and get it right away. Craig knows about this.
%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Configure the OSG CE software
Before you configure, invoke the =gums-host-cron= script once manually. This will create a gridmap file. This will allow you to run a simple gridmap test after configuring.
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin
# ./gums-host-cron
</pre>
By default it runs every 6 hours. To learn how to change the timing and other info, see [[Integration/ITB_0_5/OsgCEAuthorization#Full_privilege_mode_cron_gums_ho][gums-host-cron]]. 

To configure OSG, you'll run the =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.sh= script. You will be prompted for a lot of information. Beforehand:
   * Consult the [[AH_CESiteAdminGuide]], and make sure you've prepared for all the questions it will ask you.
   * Create the app, data, wn_tmp, site_read and site_write directories associated with local storage. (and possibly others -- for GIP, SRM, etc.%RED%How do you know?%ENDCOLOR%) 
      * Follow the appropriate links from [[AH_CESiteAdminGuide]] to find requirements on these directories. 
      * *Important:* set the directory permissions properly, as listed in [[LocalStorageConfiguration]].

Now run the configuration, with the information at your fingertips:
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring
# ./configure-osg.sh
</pre>

More information on what happens during the configuration is available at [[ConfigureOSGAttributes]].

---++ Start Services
Starting and stopping services is done via the =vdt-control= script. No services are running at this point. To start them up, go to your $VDT_LOCATION, and run:
<pre class="screen">
# source setup.[c]sh
# vdt-control --on
<i>... output ...</i>
enabling cron service fetch-crl... ok
enabling cron service vdt-rotate-logs... ok
skipping init service 'gris' -- marked as disabled
enabling inetd service globus-gatekeeper... ok
enabling inetd service gsiftp... ok
enabling init service mysql... ok
enabling init service globus-ws... ok
skipping cron service 'edg-mkgridmap' -- marked as disabled
enabling cron service gums-host-cron... ok
skipping init service 'MLD' -- marked as disabled
enabling init service apache... ok
enabling init service tomcat-5... ok
enabling cron service gratia-condor... ok
</pre>
The services that are disabled are deprecated and should remain disabled.

More information about services is available in [[StartingServices]].

---++ Condor Batch System

Start Condor. Then re-source the VDT setup script to continue.
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION
# cd ..
# source setup.[c]sh
# vdt-control --on condor
# cd $VDT_LOCATION   ###This variable isn't defined properly at this point; use the path name to this location
# source setup.[c]sh
</pre>

---++ Set up Managed Fork
To set up the Managed Fork jobmanager, run:
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION
# source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
# pacman -get OSG:ManagedFork
</pre>
<!--Respond "y" to the question about trusting the cache. (this question didn't come up) -->

To set the managed fork jobmanager as the default, execute the following command.
<pre class="screen">
# $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper --managed-fork y --server y
</pre>
For more information on configuring, disabling, etc., see [[ManagedFork]].


---++ Globus Configuration
Globus has been pre-configured for this installation. All you need to do is start services, and you did that above, before configurating the OSG CE software.  If you want to alter the configuration, see [[ConfiguringGlobusJobs]].


%INCLUDE{"CESimpleTest"}%

---++ Authorizing Users: Full Privilege with GUMS and PRIMA

The GUMS-Client package was installed with OSG CE software, and you've started the =gums-host-cron= job.  Establish local accounts on the CE to match those that will be used by the GUMS service. Your local GUMS administrator can identify these for you, or you can get the list from the =osg-user-vo-map.txt= which is generated in the steps below.

Two files need to be copied to the =/etc/grid-security= directory: =prima-authz.conf= and =gsi-authz.conf=.  
<pre class="screen">
# <b>cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gsi-authz.conf /etc/grid-security/. </b>
# <b>cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/prima-authz.conf /etc/grid-security/. </b>
</pre>

%NOTE% =gsi-authz.conf= is the key to the callout being invoked.  If you remove this file (or rename it), the Globus services will revert to use of the <i>grid-mapfile</i>.

Edit the =/etc/grid-security/prima-authz.conf= file, changing the <b>imsContact</b> attribute to point to your GUMS service.  By default, the installation has the log file verbosity set to 'debug'.  You may want to change this to 'info' (just comment and uncomment the lines shown).

The <i>gums.authz</i> entry is only used if you wish to use the <i>gums</i> client tool to test specific mappings from this host.  Documentation of this can be found on the [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/][GUMS web site]].  This same functionality can be executed using the GUMS web UI.

<pre class="programlisting">
<em>... in this example cmssrv09 was the CE node...</em>
imsContact https://<b>cmssrv09.fnal.gov</b>:8843/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort

# logging levels supported are debug, info, error, none
logLevel    debug
#logLevel    info
</pre>

The GUMS-Client package has its essential files under =$VDT_LOCATION/gums=.
Edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/gums/etc/gums-client.properties= configuration file to point to the appropriate GUMS server:  Upon installation the file contains 2 entries both populated with the hostname of the CE node you are configuring.  In this example, cmssrv09.   %BLUE% This file editing should no longer be necessary since we set VDT_GUMS_HOST before the CE install.
%ENDCOLOR%

<pre class="programlisting">
 gums.location=https://cmssrv09:8443/gums/services/GUMSAdmin
 gums.authz=https://cmssrv09:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort
</pre>

For detailed information see [[OsgCEAuthorization]]; it discusses all authorization methods.

In the earlier test case, you only authorized yourself as a local user and used the gridmap file.  Now, before even knowing if you're set up with gums authorization, check that your system is communicating with PRIMA. In one window, run =tail -f $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= to watch the messages.  In another window, run a job, e.g.:
<pre class="screen">
globus-job-run $(hostname -f):2119/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id
</pre>
In your first window, if you see messages like the following:
<pre class="screen">
 PID: 9300 -- PRIMA DEBUG prima_saml_support.cpp:456 received AuthorizationDecisionStatement
 PID: 9300 -- PRIMA DEBUG prima_saml_support.cpp:466 Parsed statement - Decision is: Deny
 PID: 9300 -- PRIMA DEBUG prima_saml_support.cpp:474 Found action: access_as_local_identity
 PID: 9300 -- PRIMA ERROR  prima_module.c:408  Identity Mapping Service did not permit mapping
</pre>
then it's working properly; you just don't have authorization in GUMS.

Now authorize yourself and other users before performing the *OSG Registration* of your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!).  Do this before doing the rest of the monitoring configuration steps below, otherwise you may  have to repeat the steps later. See the information at  [[OsgCEAuthorization#Full_Privilege_Requirements][Osg CE Authorization, Full Privilege Requirements]].  In a nutshell: create local accounts on the CE to match those that will be assigned by the !GUMS service. What are those accounts? Ask your !GUMS service administrator or look at =grid3-user-vo-map.txt=. 

---+++ Retest Full Privilege Configuration
You will need a =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile=, (CEMon needs it to run).  The file can be empty. Run the [[ReleaseDocumentation.CEInstallGuide#Site_Verification][Site Verification]] script again locally (as a regular user, *not root*)) and verify that the authorization still works. 

To check which id you get mapped to, run (using your fully-qualified gatekeeper host in the command and your own certificate):
<pre class="screen">
 $ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>   <em>OR $VDT_LOCATION/setup.<b>csh</b> </em>
 $ <b>grid-proxy-init </b>
    <em>(enter your passphrase)</em>
 $ <b>globus-job-run <em>your-gatekeeper-host</em>:2119/jobmanager-fork /usr/bin/id </b>
</pre>

%NOTE% Some sites may require VO-qualified proxies.  If so, replace =grid-proxy-init= with =voms-proxy-init= in the step above.

When  authorizing in full privilege mode, you will see the following extra entry in your =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log= file when jobs are submitted:

<pre class="programlisting">
 PID: 20269 -- PRIMA INFO  Mapping service "https://fermigrid3.fnal.gov:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort" returned local user "uscms112" for globus user "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491" 
</pre>

%NOTE% In RHEL4/SL4/Rocks 4, PRIMA requires a shared library =/usr/lib/libcom_err.so.3.0.0= which is not part of most default Redhat-like installations.  It's provided by the rpm compat-libcom_err.

---++ Installing and Configuring Globus Web Services
Instructions and configuration of WS-GRAM can be viewed at [[InstallAndConfigureGlobusWebServices]]. %BR%
%RED% First part "basics" contains commands that are only informational; go to Authorization Modes %ENDCOLOR%
For full privilege setup, all you need is:
<pre class="screen">
> cd $VDT_LOCATION
> source setup.sh
> ./vdt/setup/configure_prima_gt4 --enable \
               --gums-server YOUR_GUMS_SERVICE
</pre>
This brings up some messages; follow this documentation, not those messages. %BR%

Notes that haven't been turned into doc yet: %BR%
Need to do sudoers thing -- find user under which VDT has the services run: In Preinstall info, it says " if there's already a globus user, the web services container will run as globus; else as daemon.%BR%
In visudo, copy in do shift colon, then set list to check that there are no whitespaces after the slashes.%BR%
My =vdt-control --on globus-ws ...=
failed; did we forget to configure web services?%BR%
need to clone the host certs and have them owned by same owner as web services -- problem when you put in certs after ce install, which i did.
John thinks certs should be in place first. %BR%
Run
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_ws%BR%
and%BR%
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_wsgram

if it doesn't work, go see "starting services" to do the vdt register thing.

---++Monitoring Setup: !GIP and !CEMon

There is no extra installation or configuration to do for GIP or !CEMon. 
   * For information about GIP (information collected, validation web page, etc.) see [[CENodeGIP]].
   * CEMon requires that =/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile= exist. It can be an empty file. For more info about CEMon (about, config files, verifying that it's functional) , see [[CENodeCEMon]].

Grid components which are located behind a network firewall face special challenges for Grid setup and operations. See [[CEFireWalls]].

---++ OSG Shutdown Guide
In VDT 1.6.1 and later, all services (=/etc/init.d=, =/etc/xinetd.d=, =cron=) should be turned on/off using the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control= script.  This section will provide just a general overview. There is a <i>man</i> page available for the script, just type =man vdt-control=. You can also [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/man/vdt-control.html read the man page online]]
