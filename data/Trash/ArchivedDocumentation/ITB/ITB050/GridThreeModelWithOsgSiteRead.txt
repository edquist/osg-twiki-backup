---+ Grid3 Model for Local Storage with OSG_SITE_READ 

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

This model is similar to the [[GridThreeModel][Grid3 Model]] except that it replaces the [[LocalStorageRequirements#AboutStorageAreaOsgData][OSG_DATA]] storage area with [[LocalStorageRequirements#AboutStorageAreaOsgSiteRead][OSG_SITE_READ]] and [[LocalStorageRequirements#AboutStorageAreaOsgSiteWrite][OSG_SITE_WRITE]].

This model includes the following storage areas:
   * OSG_GRID
   * OSG_APP
   * OSG_SITE_READ
   * OSG_SITE_WRITE
   * OSG_WN_TMP

A dataflow example may be:
   * Site administrator's intervention or external transfer 
   * cp: OSG_SITE_READ  &rarr;  OSG_WN_TMP 
   * Job execution 
   * cp: OSG_WN_TMP  &rarr;  OSG_SITE_WRITE 
   * External stage-out
