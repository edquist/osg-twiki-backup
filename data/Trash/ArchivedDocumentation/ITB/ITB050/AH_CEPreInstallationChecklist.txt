%STARTINCLUDE%


---++ CE Pre-installation Checklist
%EDITTHIS%

Add instructions/recommendations on what you can do as root vs nonroot and why to choose root or not.

---+++ How to set up a cluster
We don't document this fully, but some information is in or available via links on SiteFabricBestPractices.

---+++ System or Cluster Already Setup including a functioning batch system
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, you may have a batch queuing system installed and configured.  We recommend Condor as the best-supported and best understood batch system for grids.

   * If a batch system is installed and it's one of Condor, LSF, PBS or SGE, you can use it with the CE software.  If it's Condor, we give instructions here how to use your preinstalled batch system.  For the others, some info is in SiteFabricBestPractices.  
   * If your existing batch system is not one of these four, Condor can be installed to run parasitically on other batch systems.  However it's best to just convert to Condor.
   * If you don't yet have a batch system installed, choose an OSG-supported one: Condor, LSF, PBS or SGE. We recommend Condor; the others involve some tricky post-installation steps (see SiteFabricBestPractices).

The CE software comes with a Condor installation in which the machine runs all the daemons (master, collector, negotiator, schedd, startd).  We advise you to install Condor separately.  This is described after the CE installation.

---+++ Compilers
From OSG 0.5.1 and greater no compilers are required to install the CE. Previous VDT installations presumed that you have a working C and C++ compiler as part of the install.  The gcc and g++ that come as rpms with most Linux distributions are fine.  

---+++ Network setup
It is assumed that your hardware has a working network connection through which packages may be retrieved and from which services may contact your system. The full OSG CE package is ~850 MB.

---++++!! Firewall
If your installation is inside a site firewall, has a host firewall (ipchains/iptables), or is using TCP wrappers (=/etc/hosts.{allow,deny}=), you'll need to review the [[CEFireWalls][Firewall Document]] of this guide and arrange for appropriate Internet access.

---++++!! Time synchronization (NTP) 
Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of e.g. proxy lifetimes. 

---++++!! Reverse name lookups (DNS)
For the middleware to correctly function both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system.

---+++ Previous OSG or Grid3 Installations
If there is a _previous installation_ of the OSG or Grid3 environment or other Globus middleware, please _stop the processes_ which are currently running. This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), !Integration.MonALISA and other services configured to start upon initialization on your system. Also, if you've sourced the =$VDT_LOCATION/setup.[c]sh= on your previous VDT install, just log out and log back in to clear out your environment.

More information is provided in the current [[OSGShutdownGuide][OSG Shutdown Guide]] or the Shutdown Guide for the version being upgraded.

---+++ Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs for OSG 
UNIX user accounts need to be created by the system administrator for the VOs. You will need to create at least one local user account (with the appropriate configuration) for each VO to which you wish to provide resources.  The uid and name of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later in the installation, the following default accounts are assumed for examples in this document.  VO's are frequently added to the OSG, any new VO's not mentioned here will appear in =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt= (where $VDT_LOCATION is defined after the CE software installation and setup).

The accounts are: 
<table style="vertical-align: top"><tr><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * cdf 
   * fermilab 
   * fmri 
   * gadu 
   * grase 
   * ivdgl 
   * mis 
   * sdss 
</td><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * star 
   * usatlas1 
   * uscms01 
   * ligo 
   * sam 
   * samgrid 
   * dosar 
   * des 
</td><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * glow 
   * grow 
   * gridex 
   * nanohub 
   * geant4 
   * i2u2 
   * mariachi 
   * osg 
</td><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * osgedu 
   * nwicg 
   * ops 
   * gugrid
   * gpn
   * compbiogrid
   * engage
</td></tr></table>

If there is already a "globus" user on the system, the Web Services container will run as globus, else it will run as "daemon"

---+++ Do you have a user certificate?
You will need a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Documentation/CertificateWhatIs][personal grid certificate]] to run validation tests.  If you don't have a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy (grid-proxy-init, etc), contact your [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php][VO Support Center]]. Or follow the instructions in [[AH_CEInstallGuide#Configuring_the_Public_Key_Infra][Configuring Public Key Infrastructure]].
