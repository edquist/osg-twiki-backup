---++ CE Pre-installation Checklist
%EDITTHIS%

Add instructions/recommendations on what you can do as root vs nonroot and why to choose root or not.

---+++ System or Cluster Already Setup including a functioning batch system
It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, you may have a batch queuing system installed and configured. 
   * If batch system is installed then ...
   * If you don't yet have a batch system installed, you must choose a supported one: Condor, LSF, (forgot others). We recommend Condor(?)

If you intend to use the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] system, it can be installed with pacman from the VDT cache before or after installing the CE package.  We strongly recommend to install Condor in a different directory than your main CE installation.   See Integration.CondorBatchSystemHints (hints page contains false or at least misleading statement, I have emails from STimm about it 4/26) and Integration.MinimalCondorHints for more information  And see [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/manual/v6.8/3_2Installation.html][Condor installation instructions]]. (will change version, so link will need to change)

It is assumed that your hardware is already running one of the operating systems previously mentioned. If your system is a cluster, the batch queuing system should likewise previously be installed and configured. If you intend to use the [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/condor/][Condor]] system, that can be installed with pacman from the VDT cache before this grid middleware.  It is strongly recommended to install Condor in a different directory than your main CE installation.   See Integration.CondorBatchSystemHints and Integration.MinimalCondorHints for more information.

To pull Condor from the VDT cache, use:

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_161_cache:Condor</b>
</pre>

This runs a script; answer "y" to the yes/no questions. Install the CA files in the same place as for the CE install (usually "r" for /etc/grid-security/certificates is the right choice)

---+++ If Condor is installed outside $VDT_LOCATION
(This is the case if you're a pre-existing Condor installation)
If you have installed Condor as your batch queuing system, you are required to set two environment variables so the Condor path is correctly configured. 

First run the Condor setup script to set the variables CONDOR_LOCATION and CONDOR_CONFIG.
%RED%Anne ended here 4/27 %ENDCOLOR%

   * *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION* - the location of your Condor installation  (e.g. =/opt/condor=). The Condor =bin/=, =bin=, =etc/=, =lib/=... directories should be directly under this location.
   * *VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG* (optional): The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is =$VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION/etc/condor_config=.

This will result in:
   * VDT middleware services pointing to appropriate locations in your external Condor installation.

For example, if you wish to preserve a Condor installed in the standard location,

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>export VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION=$CONDOR_ROOT </b>
</pre>

will suffice (provided $CONDOR_ROOT is set, per the usual Condor config).

---+++ Compilers
From OSG 0.5.1 and greater no compilers are required to install the CE. Previous VDT installations presumed that you have a working C and C++ compiler as part of the install.  The gcc and g++ that come as rpms with most Linux distributions are fine.  

---+++ Network setup
It is assumed that your hardware has a working network connection through which packages may be retrieved and from which services may contact your system. The full OSG CE package is ~850 MB.

---++++!! Firewall
If your installation is inside a site firewall, has a host firewall (ipchains/iptables), or is using TCP wrappers (=/etc/hosts.{allow,deny}=), you'll need to review the [[CEFireWalls][Firewall Document]] of this guide and arrange for appropriate Internet access.

---++++!! Time synchronization (NTP) 
Each system should be setup to support network time protocol. Lack of synchronization generally complicates troubleshooting and can cause problems with the security infrastructures evaluation of e.g. proxy lifetimes. 

---++++!! Reverse name lookups (DNS)
For the middleware to correctly function both the forward and reverse lookups as configured through a local DNS service are required for the IP address of the system.

---+++ Previous OSG or Grid3 Installations
If there is a _previous installation_ of the OSG or Grid3 environment or other Globus middleware, please _stop the processes_ which are currently running. This includes the Globus Resource Information Service (GRIS), !Integration.MonALISA and other services configured to start upon initialization on your system. Also, if you've sourced the =$VDT_LOCATION/setup.[c]sh= on your previous VDT install, just log out and log back in to clear out your environment.

More information is provided in the current [[OSGShutdownGuide][OSG Shutdown Guide]] or the Shutdown Guide for the version being upgraded.

---+++ Creation and setup of local user accounts for VOs for OSG 
UNIX user accounts need to be created by the system administrator for the VOs. You will need to create at least one local user account (with the appropriate configuration) for each VO to which you wish to provide resources.  The uid and name of the account can be locally determined. You will be asked to provide a mapping from local accounts to VOs later in the installation, the following default accounts are assumed for examples in this document.  VO's are frequently added to the OSG, any new VO's not mentioned here will appear in =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/grid3-user-vo-map.txt=.

The accounts are: 
<table style="vertical-align: top"><tr><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * cdf 
   * fermilab 
   * fmri 
   * gadu 
   * grase 
   * ivdgl 
   * mis 
   * sdss 
</td><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * star 
   * usatlas1 
   * uscms01 
   * ligo 
   * sam 
   * samgrid 
   * dosar 
   * des 
</td><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * glow 
   * grow 
   * gridex 
   * nanohub 
   * geant4 
   * i2u2 
   * mariachi 
   * osg 
</td><td style="vertical-align: top">
   * osgedu 
   * nwicg 
   * ops 
   * gugrid
   * gpn
   * compbiogrid
   * engage
</td></tr></table>

If there is already a "globus" user on the system, the Web Services container will run as globus, else it will run as "daemon"

---+++ Do you have a user certificate?
You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests.  If you don't have a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy (grid-proxy-init, etc), contact your [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php][VO Support Center]]. Or follow the instructions in [[CEInstallGuide#Get_a_personal_grid_certificate][Configuring Public Key Infrastructure]].
