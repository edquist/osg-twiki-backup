In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.3.10

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to

<pre>The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
</pre>

<p> Press<code>&#160;l&#160;</code>(the letter l) to select the location for the certificates.
</p> 

<p>The client will complete with the following output:</p>

You can 
<pre>

or 
. setup.sh
</pre>
to get all the client tools into your $PATH.

You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests. See the [[Integration.ITB_0_5.CertScripts#FAQ][directions for obtaining a certificate]]. If you still have questions on getting a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy (=grid-proxy-init=, etc.), contact your [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php][VO Support Center]].

<p>
If you want to submit jobs using the Personal Condor that comes
as part of the client tool, read the $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README
for information on how to start it up.  Pay specific attention 
to the "condor" script in that directory which can be used to 
start up condor at boot time.  Also note the edg-crl-upgraded 
startup script.  Without the edg-crl-upgraded script the 
Certificate Authority Certificate Revocation List files that 
are downloaded with the client will eventually expire and you 
will not be able to do any interactive globus-url-copycommands.
