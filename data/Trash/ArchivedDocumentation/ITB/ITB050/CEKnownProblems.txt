   This pretty much stops the container from processing any requests.  The client process will hang and time out.

    <b>Resolution</b>: From Jarek Gawor (gawor@mcs.anl.gov) on 9/6/06 -
                                These 'timed out' exceptions can indicate a number of problems (e.g. regular
                                networking issues) but in some cases it might indicate a deadlock condition.
                                So whenever you see these errors do 'kill -QUIT <jvm process>' on the
                               container process. That should force the JVM to dump its thread state into
                               the container log file. Send that thread dump to me or the list.

  <li>(Main.JohnWeigand - 06 Sep 2006) - <nop>NoSuchResourceException in container-real.log<br> [[http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4684][Globus 4.0.2 bugzilla ticket 4684]]
          
          Log message on startup of ws container (this will likely follow the startup after getting the <nop>SocketTimeoutException described in another <i>Known Problem</i> :

<pre class="programlisting">
2005-09-09 15:59:59,274 ERROR delegation.DelegationUtil[Thread-11,getDelegationResource:253] 
                   Error getting delegation resource
                  org.globus.wsrf.NoSuchResourceException
</pre>

          <b>Resolution</b>: This does not appear to be a problem with web services.  It is just a mis-leading message in terms of it being an ERROR.
          The web services processes should work fine.
