---++Introduction
The Open Science Grid (OSG) Generic Information Provider (OSG-GIP) has been developed to enable LCG-OSG interoperability, OSG resource selection service, [[GridCat][Integration.GridCat]], etc. The GIP is a grid information service that aggregates static and dynamic resource information for use with LDAP-based information systems. The GIP produces information based on the GLUE Schema.  For more information about OSG-GIP visit the [[http://grow.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gip/index][OSG-GIP webpage]].

---++ Installation
The Generic Information Provider is installed with the standard OSG installation.  To activate it, you must complete the configuration section of this document.

---++ ITB 0.5.2 and Beyond
---+++ Configuration
NO Extra Work needed.

When you run configure-osg.sh it will execute configure-osg-gip.sh. This will create an gip-attributes.conf file that will record all the information needed to run configure_gip. The details of the information collected can be found in the [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/bin/view/Main/OSGConfigurationParameters#GIP][OSG Configuration Parameter]] twiki. The configure_gip runs transparently.

Discussion of the questions can be found in [[GenericInformationProvidersText][text discussion page]]

---+++ Post Install
NONE

---+++ Validation Webpage
A Validator for GIP using information from the OSG BDII can be found at [[http://grow.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gipvalidate/index][http://grow.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gipvalidate/index]]. 
---+++ Overwriting attributes published by GIP %N%
Since configure_gip runs as a cron jobs site admins who used to manually update some values can no longer directly update the ldif files. Instead we have added two files: alter-attributes.conf and add-attributes.conf. These files are to be located at $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/etc/. They exploit the plugin and provider mechanism of OSG-GIP to give admins the highest priority to set any values. Example files alter-attributes.conf.example and add-attributes.conf.example are included in lcg/etc directory to provide guidance. This approach will be particularly useful in the case where you want to add new dn's. This also makes it easier to preserve changes across software updates.

%IMPORTANT% If you want to alter or add multiple dn's, remember to have two new-line characters between the dn's.

%IMPORTANT% Each override entry has to begin with the line <br> <verbatim>dn: Glue...UniqueId=...,...</verbatim> This line is crucial to identify where the information you are putting should go. This can be thought of as an hash key, telling GIP what exact attribute should be altered. (More about ldif format can be found [[http://tille.xalasys.com/training/ldap/ch01s03.html][here]]).

---++++ Typical use-case for overwriting attributes

---+++++Case 1: Altering values published for attributes for existing DNs

This allows the site admin to alter the values that are being published.

Example 1: Changing the values associated with !GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP and !GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP
By default these attributes are initialized as follows: 

<verbatim>
GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP: FALSE
GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP: TRUE
</verbatim>

Let us say for example you want to specify that you Worker nodes don't have network access. This can be done as follows:

Edit/Create $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/etc/alter-attributes.conf, and add lines similar to the example below (You need to change 'grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu' to your sites 'FQDN') 

<verbatim>

dn: GlueSubClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu, GlueClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
GlueHostNetworkAdapterOutboundIP: FALSE

</verbatim>

Example 2: If you want to state that you have inbound access to your worker node, as well as change the Operating System value being published for this !SubCluster. In this case you will again edit $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/etc/alter-attributes.conf and add the lines as  you see in the illustration below. 
<verbatim>

dn: GlueSubClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu, GlueClusterUniqueID=grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu,mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
GlueHostNetworkAdapterInboundIP: TRUE
GlueHostOperatingSystemName: My OS
GlueHostOperatingSystemRelease: MY OS RELEASE
GlueHostOperatingSystemVersion: MY-OS_V1

</verbatim>

---+++++Case 2: Adding new DNs
This gives site admin a mechanism to publish new information that are not being published by GIP. This will be most useful if site admins want to publish multiple subclusters.
%NOTE% This is an addition to existing !DNs which are already being published.

Example: Let us say you already have one !SubCluster being published by !GIP and you would like to associate two more sub-clusters (with different architecture, !OS) within the same cluster. Let these be identified by unique IDs grow-subcluster1.its.uiowa.edu and grow-subcluster2.its.uiowa.edu, and let them be associated with the cluster grow-cluster.its.uiowa.edu. Then in order to publish these two new !SubClusters, we will add the following entries to the $VDT_LOCATION/lcg/etc/add-attributes.conf file.

%IMPORTANT% It is important to get the !UniqueIDs correct since LDAP used them to form its directory structure

---+++ Configuring to publish GUMS information
If you want your GIP to publish !GUMS service status information, please follow instruction at [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/notes/GUMS.html]]

---+++ References 
   * Listing of [[Main.GIPAttributes][GIP Attributes]]
   * [[ArchivedDocumentation.ITB.ITB050.GenericInformationProvidersText][Guide to GIP Configuration Questions]]
   * [[Troubleshooting.StorageElementBestPractices][SE best practices]]
   * Glue Schema Specification: [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/]] 


---++ Pre ITB 0.5.2

---+++ Configuration
To configure GIP run the configure_gip script with the =--batch= option which specifies the local batch system at your site. (i.e. Condor, PBS, LSF, etc)

The =--srm= is an optional parameter which needs to be specified only if you have a srm accessible storage element. 

%NOTE% If you intend to install the Generic Information Provider (GIP), you should understand that the configuration script uses the =$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-attributes.conf= and  =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-app-data/MonaLisa/monalisa.properties= files.   Variables in both these files are populated with default values and you may only be prompted where a default is missing.  The <i>$VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/configure-osg.sh</i> and <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_monalisa</i> scripts populate these configuration files by prompting you for answers.   For <nop>Integration.MonALISA, you can perform the configuration and still not activate the process. 

%NOTE% Executing configure_gip creates six configuration files located at =$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/share/doc/osg-info-gip-config/= and corresponding ldif files located at =$VDT_LOCATION/lcg/var/gip/ldif/=.

---++++ Usage 
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gip --batch &lt;condor|pbs|lsf|sge&gt; [--srm]</b> 
</pre>

Example 1:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gip --batch &lt;condor|pbs|lsf|sge&gt; </b> 

We have set up the Generic Information Providers (GIP). If you were running
the GRIS (MDS), you must stop and restart it for these changes to take
affect. You can do this with the following commands:
 
/opt/osg/post-install/gris stop
/opt/osg/post-install/gris start
 
Note that this information is also in /opt/osg/post-install/README
</pre>

Example 2: 

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gip --batch <em>[condor|pbs|lsf|sge]</em> --srm; </b> 

Do you also wish to publish your gsiftp information(Y/n) [n] <b>y</b>
 
What is the siteName? (e.g. UIOWA-ITB)
<b>IOWA-SRM</b>
 
What is the permanent storage hostname? (e.g. rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu)
<b>rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu</b>
 
What is the Full path of the root directory for this storage area ?
(This will be your base directory, e.g if your accessible path is your cms accessible area is "/pnfs/xxxx.edu/data1/cms")
your full access path may be "/pnfs/xxxx.edu/"
<b>/pnfs/example.edu</b>
 
What is the local directory that is the root of this vo cdf ?
( This is the relative path e.g. e.g if your accessible path is your cms accessible area is "/pnfs/xxxx.edu/data1/cms")
your root access path may be "data/cms"
(Just hit Enter if this VO does not have an srmcp-able directory)
<b>data/cdf</b>

...

We noticed that your Default SE (rtgrid1), is different than your CE host
(rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu)
Please enter SE where gsiftp will is running: [rtgrid1]

...
</pre>


---+++ Post Install

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>/etc/init.d/gris stop</b>
&gt; <b> ps -aux | grep slapd </b>
</pre>

Make sure that the following processes have stopped 
   * $VDT_LOCATION/globus/sbin/grid-info-soft-register
   * $VDT_LOCATION/globus/libexec/slapd

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>/etc/init.d/gris start</b>
</pre>

---+++ Testing

---++++ Anonymous Bind Method (default)

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>ldapsearch -h your.fully.qualified.hostname -p 2135 -x -b mds-vo-name=local,o=grid</b>
</pre>

---++++ Authenticated Bind Method

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>grid-info-search -h your.fully.qualified.hostname</b>
</pre>

---++++ Meaning of Testing
In both cases (Authenticated and Anonymous) you should see LDAP information in LDIF format.  In most cases several screens of LDAP information will be output to the screen.

---+++ Validation Webpage
To validate a GIP installation refer to the [[http://grow.its.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gipvalidate/index][Validation Page]].  This page is updated once an hour so there may be a delay in validating your GIP installation.  After each execution the "Last run" time on the page is also updated.  This is a handy reference to see if your current installation was validated.  

%NOTE% This assumes your site has been registered and is also viewable on [[GridCat][Integration.GridCat]].

---++ Troubleshooting
   * Error comparing subject names.: Desired subject and actual subject of certificate do not match. %BR%
     Desired subject: =/CN=ldap/cmssrv09.fnal.gov=  %BR%
     Actual subject: =/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cmssrv09.fnal.gov=  %BR%
    *Cause:* You are probably using your host certificate for your LDAP certificate.  A common shortcut.

---++Useful LDAP Tool

If you run an un-authenticated GRIS / GIP and want to check your results a helpful tool is the [[http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gawor/ldap/][LDAP browser]].  
   1. Download the zip/tar file and unpack it.  
   1. Start it by running the lbe.sh script. A graphical user interface will appear.  
   1. Create a new connection and enter the following properties for the new connection:
<verbatim>
    Host: your.fully.qualified.hostname
    Port: 2135
    Base DN: mds-vo-name=local,o=grid
</verbatim>

If you would simply like to see what the GIP looks like when configured, feel free to use rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu as a hostname.


---++Explanation of BDii 
BDii is the Berkeley Database Information Index. It consists of two or more standard LDAP databases that are populated by an update process. The OSG-ITB BDii service is collecting GIP information from OSG ITB hosts which are listed in the OSG [[GridCat050][GridCat]] database which have installed OSG 0.1.6 (early version are not compatible).

The connect to the BDii service standard LDAP querying command can be used.

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>ldapsearch -LLL -x -h data.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 -b "o=grid"</b>
</pre>

The BDii server name is "data.grid.iu.edu" the BDii port to query is 2170.

---++Explanation of GIP / Glue Attributes

What follows is a large amount of [[http://www.cnaf.infn.it/~sergio/datatag/glue/index.htm][Glue attributes]] which are added by the GIP with some notes on what the attributes mean.  

%NOTE% Not all the values here have been properly configured yet, they are just provided as an example.

---+++<nop>GlueSite

*OSG unique site name* <br>
=GlueSiteName: CIT_CMS_OSG=

*Human readable description of the site* <br>
=GlueSiteDescription: Caltech CMS OSG Site=

*Site email contacts*
<verbatim>

---+++<nop>GlueCEUniqueID

<nop>GlueCEUniqueID defines a gatekeeper combined with a jobmanager and queue.  The format for the <nop>GlueCEUniqueID is hostname:port/jobmanager-batch-queue .

*Please note that 'jobmanager-condor-atlas' does not exist as a submittable jobmanager.  'jobmanager-condor' is the actual jobmanager that exists while 'atlas' is the queue that the job should be submitted to*

*The idea is that this should express how many CPU's are available at this time to a VO*

<verbatim>

</verbatim>

*How many open CPU's are available for the queue*
<verbatim>
GlueCEStateFreeJobSlots: 0
</verbatim>

*How long a job may remain in the queue before being removed (CPU time)*
<verbatim>
GlueCEPolicyMaxCPUTime: 0
GlueCEPolicyMaxRunningJobs: 0
GlueCEPolicyMaxTotalJobs: 0
</verbatim>

*How long a job may remain in the queue before being removed (Wall time)*
<verbatim>

---+++<nop>GlueSubClusterUniqueID

<nop>GlueSubClusterUniqueID provides information about what grid software version is installed on the cluster as well as general information about a cluster.  It also can hold VO published information about what software has been installed.  For example, !GlueHostApplicationSoftwareRunTimeEnvironment: CMKIN could also be added by a VO.

<verbatim>

---+++<nop>GlueCESEBindGroupCEUniqueID

Defined what storage element is considered close to this Computing Element.  This is done on a per VO basis, for example, these attributes say that the default place for atlas data to go would be to rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu and into the directory =/storage/atlas= (another convention on the LCG is that the mount point has a folder in it for each VO that is accepted)

<verbatim>
