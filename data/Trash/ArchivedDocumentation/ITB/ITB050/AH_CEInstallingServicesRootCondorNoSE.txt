---+!!<nop>OSG CE - Installing the Services as Root for use with Condor
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++ Installing OSG CE Services
%EDITTHIS%

Make sure you're logged on as root. Now you're ready to start installing the Compute Element (CE) services to install on the server/gatekeeper, as separate from software which must be executable from the worker nodes.

%NOTE% Services will not necessarily run as root (e.g., <nop>MonALISA, <nop>Globus-ws and <nop>MySql a will run as the user "daemon" by default, if installed and activated; %RED%see ?? someplace it says about the other users..).%ENDCOLOR%


---+++ Shutdown previous installations
If you have a previously installed version, you *must* do a complete shutdown and confirm that all processes associated with it have been stopped before you remove the old software.
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION
# source setup.[c]sh
# vdt-control --off
</pre>
Refer to the [[CEInstallGuide#CE_Shutdown_Guide][CE Shutdown Guide section of the CE Install Guide]] for details.

%IMPORTANT% Choose the correct link in that section for the specific version you are replacing.  Be sure all services and crons are disabled; see [[StartingServices]]. (It covers stopping them, too.)

---+++ Choose an installation directory 
This is typically something like =/usr/local/grid=, but whatever suits the local resource structure is fine. This directory does not need to be shared by the worker nodes.  Any software which needs to be seen from the worker nodes may be provided by the worker node client package.

For example:
<pre class="screen">
# mkdir -p /usr/local/grid
# cd /usr/local/grid
</pre>

---+++Installing the OSG CE software package

Verify that the umask is set to "0022" prior to installation.  Failure to do so may render the installation unusable. %ENDCOLOR%
<pre class="screen">
# umask 0022
</pre>

Finally, make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable.

Install the OSG software packages:
<pre class="screen">
 # <b>pacman -get ITB:ce</b>    <i>... for the ITB test version</i>
OR
 # <b>pacman -get OSG:ce</b>    <i>... for the OSG production version</i>
</pre>
A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed.   Please answer *y* (yes) so that the software can be retrieved.

See the [[PacmanInfo][Pacman page]] if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message.

%NOTE% This will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending upon the system and network connection. During this time you may open a second terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the =vdt-install.log= file under your installation directory.

You should not be asked any other questions during the installation process.

The installation should complete with the following message (software versions will change). 

<pre class="screen">
Downloading [site-verify-1.0-9.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software///site-verify/1.0]...

Pacman Installation of OSG-0.6.0 Complete
</pre>

---+++ Setup the OSG environment
 Assuming the Pacman install completed without fatal errors, you should now be able to source the OSG setup environment. From your installation directory, source the setup script:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>source setup.sh</b>
      <em>OR</em>
% <b>source setup.csh</b>
</pre> 
This sets the variable <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i> to your installation directory.  

In order to interface your Condor installation to the OSG CE software, run:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>pacman -get OSG:Globus-Condor-Setup</b>
</pre>

Or for OSG-ITB substitute <i>ITB</i> for <i>OSG</i>.

It asks you if you want to run the Condor batch system automatically.  Answer *y*.

Globus-Condor-Setup will include web-services (Globus-WS-Condor-Setup) and Gratia probes. This guide does not go into the detail on the installation of any of these packages.

Note that there is a =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= file. You don't have to look at it.
 It is not OSG-specific. If you read it, do so *for information only*, do not follow any instructions in it or worry about error messages in it. Rather, follow the instructions in this guide.
