SDSS/DES is also participating in Opportunistic Storage validation. 
</b>

---++ Validation procedure

The test job we are running on ITB mimics operations that real DES simulation program is doing. It is a shell script that starting on WN creates in the
WN-TMP a working directory. Then it copies data and executables from submission host using globus-url-copy.
After unziping and untaring files it execute the Java program that produces one result file. This file is then copied to an opportunistically reserved
space on a SE using srmcp command. After this the working directory is removed.

LBNL_DSD_ITB : the site configuration seems to be wrong.                                                                                                  
Submitted job does not see OSG_GRID directory and can not setup OSG environment.
