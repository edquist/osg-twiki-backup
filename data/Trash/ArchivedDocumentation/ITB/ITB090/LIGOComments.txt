---++ General Information

I tested the sites by submitting a 'small' (using a small amount of LIGO input data, producing a small amount of intermediate/output data) LIGO work-flow. This work-flow contained about 200 nodes, including directory creation jobs at the remote site, simple chmod jobs, a complex data transfer job  to the remote site and some LIGO specific complex data analysis jobs. The output data was tar-ed and transferred back to the submit host as part of the work-flow as well.

---++ Status of ITB testing
1) TWO LIGO work-flow ran successfully at FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB (04/25)

2) TWO LIGO work-flow ran successfully at UC_ITB (04/26)

3) TWO  LIGO work-flow ran successfully at BNL_ITB_ Test1 (04/26)

4) TWO  LIGO work-flow ran successfully at LBNL_DSD_ITB (05/19)

5) ONE LIGO work-flow successfully ran at CIT_ITB_1 (05/23)

---++ Known issues
1) nfs-lite does not respect condor's remote_initialdir, workarounds are in place at CIT_ITB_1 and LBNL_DSD_ITB

2) Changes to the file system needed to be made at LBNL_DSD_ITB
