We ran the same analysis workflow that we are presently running on about 40 sites globally.
This was done on an itb CE at UCSD that provides access to the production cluster and the production SE.
It's the only sensible way that we can do this kind of test.

It's not clear to us to what extend this test is guaranteeing anything with respect to the quality of the upcoming release.
As this release validation is happening in the middle of CCRC08, this is the best we can do at this point.

We are confident that we can deal with whatever remaining problems there might be, and that we have not caught
by doing this test.

Thanks, Frank
