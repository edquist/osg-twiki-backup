Included here are some details that are needed to get an SGE batch system to run on the grid.

   * Prior to installing Globus-SGE-Setup make sure that your environment points to the appropriate SGE installation. This is usually done by sourcing the SGE setup file =/path-to-sge/common/settings.sh= . This should define the variables $SGE_ROOT and $SGE_CELL. 
   * For Gratia to work "accounting" must be turned on: <pre class=screen><b>$qconf -mconf</b> 
...snip... 
reporting_params  	accounting=true, ...
... snip ...
</pre>
   * For WS-GRAM to work "reporting" must be turned on <pre class=screen><b>$qconf -mconf</b> 
...snip... 
reporting_params  	..., reporting=true, ...
...snip...
</pre>
      * currently WS-GRAM does not handle rotating the reporting file
      * WS-GRAM will also fail if SGE's ARCO service is also being run on the installation as it deletes the reporting file
