To register the resource with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the GOC's [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM Registration DB]]. To use OIM you will need to have an [[http://www.gridpma.org/ ][IGTF]]  member certificate in your browser. If you have previously registered your resource with the OSG please visit this link and confirm or update any stale information about your resource. If you are registering with the OSG for the first time you will need to fill in User Contact information before registering your resource. The OIM pages will guide you through the process.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a resource to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. Please take time to fill out the registration forms as completely as possible, this will allow the GOC to keep track of the resource and contact information and gather updated information from you as necessary.
