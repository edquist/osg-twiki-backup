---++ Introduction

The accounting service for OSG is provided by the Gratia external project. Job and other accounting information gathered by Gratia probes run on the compute element or other site nodes are reported to a Gratia collector operated by the !FermiGrid/Gratia development team.

---++ Probes

The probes required to report accounting data from the CE to the central collector are available via pacman and are usually installed automatically as part of the relevant batch system.

---++ Service location and simple usage

The reporting interface for the Gratia accounting information is located at http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:%GratiaCollectorPort%/gratia-reporting/.  See ValidateGratia for details about validating a compute element's accounting information. A local collector may be installed as a collecting point for local information prior to replication to the main reporting site; for further details, see GratiaSiteCollector.
