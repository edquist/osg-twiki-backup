---+!! Supported VOs and Undefined UNIX Accounts

---++ Identifying the OSG VOs your site supports and any undefined UNIX accounts
Beginning with OSG 0.6.0, there are 3 files that are created during the execution of the _edg-mkgridmap_ and _gums-host-cron_ scripts that are intended to aid in verifying that you have configured your authorization service for all the VOs you intend to support and, also that all the UNIX accounts have been created on your CE node.  This verification/validation can only be determined on each of the CE nodes your authorization service supports.
   * VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt
   * VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-undefined-accounts.txt
   * VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/osg-supported-vos-list.txt

The _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ is a critical component to the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome][OSG Accounting Services]] in accurately collecting grid resource usage and metrics by VO.  This file should never be manually modified if either the _edg-mkgridmap_ or _gums-host-cron_ are enabled (both are cron initiated processes).

---+++ osg-user-vo-map.txt



---+++ osg-undefined-accounts.txt
This file contains a list of those UNIX accounts that have been eliminated from the _osg-user-vo-map.txt_ file because the UNIX account assigned by the authorization service does not exist.  

The test used to determine the UNIX account's existence is 'id -u &lt;account&gt;'.  However, there is __no__ verfication performed  to determine if a HOME directory exists for the account.

This file's timestamp will only change when the contents of the file changed. To assist in verifying the currency of the file, another file called _osg-undefined-accounts.txt.last_checked_ is created ('touched')  each time the processes are run.
