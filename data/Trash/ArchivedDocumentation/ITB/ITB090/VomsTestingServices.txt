---++ About VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS testing

There are several functions on the grid that access your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS VO:
   1. voms proxy generation through =voms-proxy-init= command
   1. grid-mapfile generation on the CE nodes
      * =edg-mkgridmap= for Grid3 authorization mode</UL>
   1. GUMS  interface for Compatibility and Full Privilege authorization modes

---++ Testing voms-proxy-init
The =voms-proxy-init= client command was included in the installation. It uses a configuration file containing the necessary arguments to access a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server. On the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server node, this file is  located in the =$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/vomses= directory and looks like this for the =VDT= VO:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc</b>
&gt; <b>ls -ld vomses</b>
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           44 Sep  4 23:03 vomses -> /usr/local/osg-voms/vdt-app-data/voms/vomses

&gt; <b>cat vomses/VDT</b>
"VDT" "cms-xen3.fnal.gov" "15000" "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov" "VDT" "40"
</pre>

Tokens in the above =vomses/VDT= file:
   1. Considered a "nickname"  and , although the default is the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name, it can be any value you desire to identify the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you wish to get a proxy from.
   1. The hostname of the voms server
   1. Port number the server is listening on.
   1. DN of the server's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS certificate
   1. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name
   1. Globus version supported

The =vomses= file syntax/values for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI of  your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo by selecting =Configuration information= on the left hand menu of the main page.

On the server, there is no need to create a =$HOME/.glite/vomses= file containing the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers you wish to access.  The =voms-proxy-init= command will search the =vomses= directory on this server for this file. 

To test the =voms-proxy-init= command, make sure that you have already added yourself as a member of the VO. As yourself (not =root= user), run the following commands:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>voms-proxy-init --voms VDT:/VDT</b>
<em>...output follows.. </em>
Cannot find file or dir: $prefix/etc/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase: <b><em>[PASSPHRASE]</em></b>
Creating temporary proxy ............................................... Done
Contacting  cms-xen3.fnal.gov:15000 [/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov] "VDT"  Done
Creating proxy ................................. Done
Your proxy is valid until Tue Sep  5 23:03:02 2006
</pre>

A couple of things about the output shown above that you might want to be aware of:
   * The warning about not finding a =$prefix/etc/vomses= is not a problem.  It should have already picked up the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo server from the =$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/vomses/VDT= file.  This may be a legacy PATH when the vomses file was in =$VDT_LOCATION./voms/etc/vomses=.
   * The "temporary proxy" it generates is the good old grid proxy.  This is used for the access to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and, as it says, just temporary.

To verify the output of the voms proxy has the extended attributes the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service provides, run the =voms-proxy-info= command as shown below. The extended attribute and location of the proxy file are highlighted in the output:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-proxy-info --all</b>
<em>... output follows....</em>
WARNING: Unable to verify signature! Server certificate possibly not installed.
Error: Cannot find certificate of AC issuer for vo VDT

Again, ignore the =WARNING= and =Error= in the output above, as all is fine.


Now try one for a group you do not belong to, e.g., _/MyGroup_:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>voms-proxy-init --voms VDT:/MyGroup</b>
<em>...output follows.. </em>
Cannot find file or dir: $prefix/etc/vomses
Your identity: /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491
Enter GRID pass phrase: <b>[PASSWORD]</b>

Error: VDT: Unable to satisfy G/MyGroup Request!

Failed to contact servers for VDT.
</pre>

%NOTE% If a subsequent attempt at a voms proxy fails, as ours did here, the previously generated proxy is still in effect. You can do another =voms-proxy-info --all= to verify this.



---++ Testing edg-mkgridmap
The =edg-mkgridmap= is run on a site's Compute Element (CE) node to generated a =grid-mapfile= file.  This script is not provided as a part of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS installation, so you will have to go a CE node to test this.  You do not have to be the =root= user on the CE node, but you will need to have a personal certificate available.

The =mkgridmap= file syntax/values for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo you create, can be viewed on the WEB UI for your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo by selecting =Configuration information= on the left hand menu of the main page.

<pre class="programlisting">
group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  .VDT
</pre>

%NOTE% The =.VDT= (3rd token) is an EDG format for the account name.   You will likely want to change it to the group account you want assigned for your CE node.  The example above is for a =group= account assignment.

To test, you will need to do this on a CE node.

<ul>
  <li>In some writable area, create a =edg-mkgridmap.conf= file and populate it with the example configuration file on your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server.  It will be the only entry.
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>echo 'group vomss://cms-xen3.fnal.gov:8443/voms/VDT  .VDT' >./edg-mkgridmap.conf</b>
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Execute the edg-mkgridmap allowing the output to go to stdout:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>edg-mkgridmap --conf ./edg-mkgridmap.conf </b>
  Enter PEM pass phrase: 
  <b><em>... enter your pass phrase...</em></b>
  <em>... output follows ...</em>
  "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491" .VDT
  "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=cms-xen3.fnal.gov"  .VDT
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

---++ Testing the GUMS interface
The GUMS authorization server periodically 'pulls' the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership data for it's authorization and account assignment  functions from the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers.  

Unfortunately, there is no way of testing this except with an installed GUMS server which this document does not address.
