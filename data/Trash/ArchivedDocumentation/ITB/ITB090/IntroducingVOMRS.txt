---++ Introduction

The [[http://www.uscms.org/SoftwareComputing/Grid/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo/index.html][Virtual Organization Management Registration Service (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS)]] 
is compliant with OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo policy and offers a comprehensive set of services that facilitates secure 
and authenticated management of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership, grid resource
authorization and privileges:
   * implements a registration workflow providing means for collaborators to register with a Virtual Organization (VO)
   * supports management of multiple grid certificates per member
   * permits VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-level control of member's privileges 
   * provides email notifications of selected events
   * keeps track of Grid and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo AUPs signed by members
   * supports VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-level control over its trusted set of Certificate Authorities (CA)
   * permits delegation of responsibilities within the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo administrators
   * manages groups and group roles
   * is capable of interfacing to third-party systems and pulling or pushing relevant member information from/to them
   * is synchronized with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS 

---++ Components

It has three main parts: 
   * !MySQL database which is a persistent repository for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership information, 
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat.
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS server, a daemon process which performs variety of tasks that include synchronization with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, sending email notifications, managing Certificate Authorities certificates within VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS, etc.

Also included in the installation is a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS soapclient that allows to execute any webservice supported by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS for testing.

When you install VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS, you get all three parts.  VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS is synchronized with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, so VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS will be installed on your system as well. Please refer to [[VomsInstallGuide][VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS Installation Guide]] for all issues related to VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS.

VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS comes with a test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called _VDT_. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.
