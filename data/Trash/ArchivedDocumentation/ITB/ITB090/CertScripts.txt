---++Introduction
The cert-scripts package ( =$VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts= or pacman package PPDG-Cert-Scripts) provides several useful scripts for interacting with CA's and the cert-check-time script is helpful in setting up and monitoring the CA certificates and CRL's that get installed in your trusted certificates directory.

---++Checking CA certificates
There are numerous CA certificates installed with VDT and you may not want to allow all of them on your site.  The =cert-check-time= is a helpful command for reviewing them. This must be run in a directory where you have write access even though it does not create any permanent files.  You may want to redirect  stdout to a file you can then review.

<pre class="screen">
> <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
> <b>cd <em>/writtable/directory</em> </b>
> <b>$VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts/bin/cert-check-time -cR </b>
</pre>    

For each CA, the output shows ([[CertCheckTimeSampleOutput][sample output]]) :
   * remaining lifetime of the CA certificate,
   * the human readable name of the CA 
   * and the location of the actual certificate file.

In addition, at the bottom of the listing it points out which CA's do not have a CRL. This is useful AFTER the edg-crl-upgraded daemon has run at least once because then it shows those CA's which have not published a certificate revocation list. Note that two of the CAs, Kerberos CAs from PSC (85ca9edc.0) and FNAL (e1fce4e9.0) don't really need CRLs since they only generate short lived certificates.

---++Checking CRL's
Certificate revocation lists contain the list of certificates (by serial number) that have been issued by a CA but then revoked, meaning you should not accept them. CRL's are updated frequently and typically have a lifetime limited to a month or less.
When a CRL has expired, the CRL file will still exist in the trusted certificates directory, but Globus will fail all authentication attempts for <b>all</b> certificates issued by the corresponding CA.

For this reason, and others, it is important that CRL files are current and not expired. Another variation of the cert-check-time script will list the remaining lifetime of CRL's in the trusted certificates directory. This must be run in a directory where you have write access even though it does not create any files.  You may want to redirect  stdout to a file you can then review.

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>$VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts/bin/cert-check-time -r </b>
</pre>

For each CRL, the output  ([[SampleCertCheckTimeCRLs][sample output]]) shows:
   * the remaining lifetime,
   * the name of the CA that issued the CRL
   * and the actual CRL file.

Site administrators may find it useful to run this command in a daily cron job following the edg-crl-upgraded daemon as a way to monitor the status of the CRL's.

---++FAQ
---+++Request a certificate for myself
Use =cert-request -ou p=

---+++Request a certificate for my computer
Use =cert-request -ou s=

---+++Request a certificate for the ldap service on my computer
Use =cert-request -ou s -service ldap -host <i>my-computer.some.domain</i> -label <i>ldap-my-computer</i>=

---+++ How do I retrieve a certificate
   1. Check the email notice you got when the certificate was granted for the serial number (<i>0xNNNN</i>)
   1. Use =cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0xNNNN</i> [-label <i>label-matching-cert-request</i>]=

---+++How do I get lots of service certificates
   1. Ask your RA to grant you the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Library/gridAdmin/gridAdminUser.html][gridadmin]] privilege.
   2. Use =cert-gridadmin= and you can get service certificates issued immediately  without using the web interface. (Since VDT 1.3.10, cert-scripts V1-7)

---+++ My certificate is about to expire, how do I get another with the same DN
   1. Use =cert-renew=

---++Additional Information

For additional information on the functionality of the cert-check-time script execute it with the =-h= option.
