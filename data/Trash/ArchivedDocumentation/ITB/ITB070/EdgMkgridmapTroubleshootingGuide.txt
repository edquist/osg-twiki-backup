---++ Introduction
This document is intended to provide some assistance in troubleshooting problems  related to use of the =edg-mkgridmap= script and =edg-makegridmap-upgrade= daemon used to maintain  the CE/gatekeeper node grid-mapfile based members pulled from the various VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS servers.

%RED%This is only for grid-3 and compatibility authorization then, not for full privilege?  Please state explicitly in the intro text. %ENDCOLOR%

This does not address retrieval of members from LDAP servers.


---++ Error code 64
This type of error generally occurs when the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server cannot find the requested group or subgroup.  Contact with the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS server was made and it is really a 'not found' type error.  It is caused by a bad entry in the =edg-mkgridmap.conf= file.

The example below is attempting to access all members of  the uscms VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo belonging to the /uscms/production group.

Configuration file =VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf= entry:<br>
<pre class="programlisting">
 group vomss://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/uscms/production uscms01
</pre>

Command run on CE node:
<pre class="screen">
 > <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.(c)sh </b>
 > <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin </b>
 > <b>./edg-mkgridmap </b>
   <i>... output....
  voms search(https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/uscms/production/services/VOMSAdmin?method=listMembers): /voms/uscms/production/services/VOMSAdmin

   Exit with error(s) (code=64)</i>
</pre>

On the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS host you are attempting to access, the following error can be seen in the =TOMCAT_LOCATION/logs/voms-admin.VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo_NAME.log=

<pre class="programlisting">
