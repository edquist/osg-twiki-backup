Several steps have to be done to actually enable your VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS installation to begin accepting membership, synchronizing with voms, sending notifications.

The following sub-sections will reference the default <i>VDT</i> in the text and examples.  When enabling your 'real' VO, the same steps are required and, where different, it will be noted.


---++ Establishing a first member
A first member of a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is a designated as a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoAdmin for the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo created.  This person has administrative capability within VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS that the normal VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo member will not have. Only the first member of the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo could be added the way described below.  

%NOTE%

There are 2 options for adding a first member to a  VO:

<ol>
     <li>Individual's certificate file is available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vomrs/sbin/.add_admin --vo <em>VO</em>  --file <em>usercert.pem</em> 
          --org <em>Fermilab</em> --firstname <em>Name</em> --lastname <em>Last Name</em> 
          --phone <em>Phone</em> </b>
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vomrs/sbin/.add_admin --vo <em>VO</em> --nousercert  
         --dn "<em>USER DN</em>"  "<em>USER CA</em>" --org <em>Fermilab</em> 
         --firstname <em>Name</em> --lastname <em>Last Name</em> 
         --phone <em>Phone</em></b>
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


---++ Verifying you are a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoAdmin
If you've established yourself with the <i>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoAdmin</i> role, you can now go back the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS web ui in a browser with your certificate and from the main menu:
   1. You can see that there are now many expandable menu items.
   1. Click on  <i>[+]Members</i>, select <i>Role: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoAmin</i> from drop down menu. 
   1. Then, select <i>Search</i>
