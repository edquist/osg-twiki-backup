   * run the following command and see if your Site / Gatekeeper are listed there:<br /><tt>condor_status -pool osg-ress-4.fnal.gov  -format '%s\t' !GlueSiteName -format '%s\n' !GlueCEInfoContactString | sort | uniq</tt> .  Note there have been reports that if port 9618 is blocked by a firewall at your site, this will not work for you.

   *  There is also a web-based representation of this data at [[https://osg-ress-4.fnal.gov:8443/cgi-bin/main.cgi][https://osg-ress-4.fnal.gov:8443/cgi-bin/main.cgi]]
    
   * IF you do not see your site in the output of the previous command, something is wrong with your CEMon or GIP installation. Follow the [[ResourceSelection/CEMonTroubleshootingGuide][CEMon Trash/Troubleshooting Guide]]. Note that the troubleshooting guide refers to the OSG !ReSS production system at osg-ress-1.fnal.gov: to troubleshoot the !ReSS integration testbed system always use osg-ress-4.fnal.gov, instead.
