To faciliate ongoing maintenance of the <i>grid-mapfile</i> and <i>osg-user-vo-map.txt</i> files, a cron file and script were installed in your installation directory and will need to be activated.
   * In the Compatibility Scenario, both the <i>grid-mapfile</i> and <i>osg-user-vo-map-txt</i> need to be updated at the same time from your GUMS server.
   * In the Full Privilege Scenario, only the <i>osg-user-vo-map-txt</i> needs to be updated from your GUMS server.

A script (<i>gums-host-cron</i>) has been provided in <i>$VDT_LOCATION/gums/scripts/gums-host-cron</i>  This script will do the following:
   1. It executes the <i>gums-host</i> command  using both the <i>generateGridMapfile</i> and <i>generateGrid3UserVoMap</i> arguments. In order to determine your authorization mode, the script looks for the existence of the PRIMA callout in the <i>/etc/grid-security/gsi-authz.conf</i> file.  If present, it assumes Full Privilege mode.  If not, it assumes Compatiblity mode.
   1. It will create a temporary copy of the files and compare them against the current copy
   1. It only updates the CE nodes current copy if a change has occurred.  When a change is effected, a backup of the old file with a <i>*.cronsaved</i> suffix will be created.   This allows an adminstrator to more easily identify any changes.  
The date of the backup file will reflect when it was last in effect.
   1. At the completion of each successful run, it will create an empty <i>osg-user-vo-map.last-checked</i> file.  This file allows the administrator(s) to more easily verify the currency of the data.
   1. Finally, it calls the configure_gip script to make sure that any newly-supported VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's are correctly published to the Generic Information Providers.

To test the <i>gums-host-cron</i> script and to initially populate the two files for the first time using your GUMS server (as <i>root</i>):

<pre class="screen">
 &gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/gums/scripts/gums-host-cron</b>
</pre>

To implement the cron (as <i>root</i>):

<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>vdt-register-service --name gums-host-cron --enable</b>
&gt; <b>vdt-control --on gums-host-cron</b>
</pre>

This will make a entry in root's crontab.

%RED%
There is a known bug that gums-host-cron does not correctly detect that 
64-bit systems are using PRIMA and thus generates both a grid-mapfile
and an osg-user-vo-map.txt even when the grid-mapfile is not needed in 
full compatibility mode.
%ENDCOLOR%

%IMPORTANT% Beginning with OSG 0.5.1, the =grid3-user-vo-map.txt= name is being deprecated.  The new name will be =osg-user-vo-map.txt=.  The documentation in this section will reference the new name.  To facilitate the transition, the scripts that maintain this file will insure both files exists (the old one symlinked to the new one).  So when you see this occur, do not be concerned.  At some point in the future when all components referencing this file have been changed, the scripts will remove all evidence of this little inconvenience.

 Main.JohnWeigand - 29 Sep 2006 - NOTE:  This is used as an include and intentionally mentions both Compatiblity and Full Privilege Modes even though this may be included in sections specific to one or the other.   Much of the explantion is the same regardless of the mode and I wanted it to be consistent.  %BR%
