---++ Test Description
The intent of this stress test on the GUMS authorization service was to determine if it was capable of handling a target of 1M authorizations per day.

To perform this test, the GUMS 1.1 client's _gums-service mapUser_ command  was used because it generates an authorization request to the GUMS server using the same protocol as the PRIMA callout.  This eliminated any overhead or restrictions that may be inherent in the GT2/4 gatekeepers.
   * A wrapper script was written to allow multiple <i>gums-service</i> clients  to be spawned in background from each client node.
   * Each instance of the <i>gums-service</i> command could specify an argument allowing it to invoke <i>n</i> number of authorization requests.

The summarization of the requests handled by the GUMS service was done by a script that parsed the <i>gums-service-admin.log</i> file for authorization responses only:

iax32.fnal.gov] -
  Mapped on host '/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gratiax32.fnal.gov'
  the user '/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491' / '/fermilab/R
ole=NULL/Capability=NULL'
  to 'fermilab'
</pre>

After all client processes completed, a manual verification was done to insure that none of the authorization request had 'timed-out'. None had in any of the tests.

%NOTE%
In the event the use of a GUMS 1.1 client, rather than a 1.2 client, is questioned:  At the time of the test, all the nodes used in the test had VTB 1.7.0 CE nodes installed and the original wrapper script written was for GUM 1.1.  The GUMS 1.2 client has significant changes to it and time constraints in completing the test did not allow for that change. The client side is not a factor in server side performance.

---++ Test Environment
---+++ Server
The authorization service was on cmssrv08.fnal.gov with a VTB 1.7.1 installed GU
MS 1.2.0.  The specifications for cmssrv08 are:
<pre class="screen">
<b>&gt; vdt-version</b>
You have installed a subset of VDT version 1.7.1a:
    Apache HTTPD 2.2.4
    CA Certificates v27 (includes IGTF 1.15 CAs)
    Fetch CRL 2.6.2
    GPT 3.2
    GUMS 1.2.1

---+++ Clients
The test was performed using the GUMS 1.1 client's _gums-service mapUser_
command from the following nodes:
   * gratiax31.fnal.gov
   * gratiax32.fnal.gov
   * cmssrv09.fnal.gov

This is a sample of the command executed:
<pre class="screen">
$VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin/gums-service mapUser -n 1 -t 1
  -service /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gratiax31.fnal.gov
  -f /cms/uscms/Role=cmsuser/Capability=NULL
  -i /DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=gratiax31.fnal.gov
 "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=John Weigand 458491"
</pre>
   * The _-n_ option tells the _mapUser_ to repeat the authorization request _n_ time.  This reduced the number of clients that needed to be spawned.  The only caveat is that it repeats the authorization request for the same FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).
   * The FQDN is specified by the DN (last argument) and the _-f_ option with the FQAN (Fully Qualified Attribute Name)
