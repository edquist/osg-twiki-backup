---+!!<nop>OSG CE Authorization
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++Introduction
The Authorization system determines who can access your resources and how. A good description of the available authorization scenarios can be found on  the
<a href="http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_architecture.html#GUMS_in_the_grid_architecture">
GUMS web site</a>.  Of those discussed, OSG supports three, namely: Grid3/Local, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. All three use VOMS. Here's a brief explanation of each follows.

---+++Changes effective with this release

---+++<nop>Grid3 or local <nop>GridMap file
Authorization is performed only via the <i>grid-mapfile</i> on the Compute Element (CE) node. 

The grid-mapfile is either created manually on each CE node, or created using the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> root cron entry based upon the configuration file <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file located in <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc</i>. This file is installed by the VO package which can be updated to add or update VO information. The OSG Operations sends update announcements to each support center.  VOMS is used; GUMS is not used. 

Synchronizing all the <i>grid-mapfiles</i> for multiple CE nodes needs to be done manually in this case.  You may prefer this configuration if:
      <UL><LI>You are a small site (one gatekeeper) and,
               <LI>You deal with a small set of fairly static VOs
               <LI>You are <b>not</b> supporting <i>role-based</i> authorizations (voms proxies with extended attributes)
       </UL>

---+++<nop>Compatibility
Authorization is performed via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper, and the file is created by GUMS.  

GUMS polls VOMS Admin periodically and creates/updates the grid-mapfile. If the site has only one GUMS server (one communication point to VOMS), centralized mapping is enabled. Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).  You should consider this configuration if:
      <UL><LI>Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured using a grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipulate this file directly, without passing through globus)
                <LI>You'd rather approach with caution than jump right into running GUMS 24/7.
       </UL>

---+++Full Privilege (role-enabled) 
This scenario implements the PRIMA authorization module with GUMS and does not use the grid-mapfile.  The gatekeeper uses a callout to PRIMA upon receipt of each request, PRIMA forwards the request to the GUMS web service which performs the dynamic mapping. PRIMA can process FQAN (Fully Qualified Attribute Names), thus enabling mapping based on VO groups and roles as defined in VOMS.

Authorization is performed only via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper. The grid-mapfile is either created manually on each gatekeeper, or created by a VOMS Admin installation.  VOMS is used; GUMS is not used. Synchronizing all the grid-mapfiles for multiple CE nodes is difficult in this case.
   *  manually on each gatekeeper, 
In this configuration, you will need the EDG mkgridmap daemon running on your gatekeeper to create the grid-mapfile (discussed below).

The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script uses a configuration file to dictate 
  its behavior. This config file is 
  <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>.

  The <i>edg-gridmapfile-upgrade</i> daemon has a similar configuration
  file: <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</i>.

  One of the parameters specifies a _local_ <i>grid-mapfile</i> that
  will be added to the output of the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> command (the set of DNs returned from all the VOMS).  You need to populate this file; it's at <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local</i>

Now, to create this local portion:
<OL>
<LI> Set the *GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE* variable in 
    <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</i> as shown. <b>Warning</b>: If you put in a bad address, it won't find the file, but it fails silently.
   <pre>
      GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE=$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local
    </pre>
</LI>
<LI>  Add this new directive to the end of the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>  (use the actual path, not the $VDT_LOCATION variable).   If you put in a bad address, you should get an error message.
  <pre>
    gmf_local   PATH_TO_VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local
   </pre>
</LI>
</OL>
You should now have local <i>grid-mapfile</i> entries added to this file every time the script is executed.
   * Any <i>gmf_local</i> directive(s) should be the last entries in the <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file.
---+++ Configure the list of VOs you wish to enable
The default configuration, set in the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>  file, provides access from all registered and approved OSG VOs. If that is acceptable to you, then you're done with this step. If not, then you'll need to edit the file commenting out the line for each VO you wish to disable.

 > <b>ls -l test.out* </b>
If the VO administrator has not enabled world read of the VO membership, then you must contact the VO
administrator and request that your site be given access to the VOMS database. You will need to provide
the Subject and Issuer Distinguished Names (DN) for your host certificate.  The simplest thing to do is send email
to the VO administrator requesting access and including the output of the command (check that the path to the hostcert.pem is correct for you):
  -rw-r--r--  1 root root      0 Oct 30 15:03 test.out.1

Refer to the [[Integration.ITB_0_5.EdgMkgridmapTroubleshootingGuide][edg-mkgridmap troubleshooting guide]] for any problems/errors.
---+++ Configuring /etc/rc.d services for edg-mkgridmap
Since VOs are likely adding/removing members over time, you will want to update your grid-mapfile to reflect this. OSG provides  the /etc/rc scripts for this service.  The following commands will copy and start the daemon (do these as <i>root</i>). 
<pre>
   &gt; cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded /etc/init.d/.
   &gt;  /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded start
</pre>
The script will run as a daemon updating the gridmap file based on the <i>GRIDMAP_UPGRADE_DELAY=1d</i> attribute in <i>VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</i>.

Make sure you run <i>chkconfig --add  /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded</i> so that the service will automatically start on a reboot.

If the site has only one GUMS server (one communication point to VOMS), centralized mapping is enabled.

In Compatibliity mode, authorization is still performed using the <i>grid-mapfile</i>.  The difference is in the source of the VO membership data/account assignments.  Instead of each CE node pulling independently from the VO VOMS servers.  Each CE node for your site pulls the data from your site's GUMS server.  Thus, centralized mapping is enabled.  Your site's GUMS server polls the VOs' VOMS servers much the same as the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> process did, the difference being that all CE nodes account assignments are managed in one place, the GUMS server.  Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).

---+++Compatibility Requirements
Your site needs to install and configure GUMS service. There needs to be one GUMS server per map of 'DN to local uid'. An institution would only need one GUMS server if there is a global uid assignment (eg. a single NIS domain).  If you will have multiple account domains, you will need a GUMS server for each domain.   Each account domain can cover  any number of CE hosts, clusters storage elements (SEs)  as long as all systems have a consistent set of POSIX Users|UIDs|Groups|GIDs. 
   * One GUMS server per local account domain to manage the mapping from Grid identity (DN+attributes) to local username
