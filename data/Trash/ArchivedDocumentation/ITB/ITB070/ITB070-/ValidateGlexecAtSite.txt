---++ Validating gLexec
Instructions on how to install and configure gLexec are at GlexecInstall.  This 
guide is only given for users to validate a site and see if it is running gLexec 
or not.
Here's a simple shell script that will check if a site has glexec installed and configured
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# $OSG_GRID should be location of worker node client and glexec is 
# assumed to be in that location.
if [ "$OSG_GRID" != "" ] && [ -d "$OSG_GRID" ] 
then
     . $OSG_GRID/setup.sh
     export GLEXEC_CLIENT_CERT="$X509_USER_PROXY"
     cd $OSG_GRID
     if [ -x glexec-osg/sbin/glexec ] 
     then 
          ls -l glexec-osg/sbin/glexec
          ldd glexec-osg/sbin/glexec
         glexec-osg/sbin/glexec /usr/bin/id
     else
         echo "glexec binary not found" 
     fi 
else
      echo "$OSG_GRID not found"
fi
</pre>

Make a file of this script, and then submit it via jobmanager-condor
to the resource that is being tested.
If it is successful, it will show a uid/gid as the last output on standard out.
If not, it will abort.
