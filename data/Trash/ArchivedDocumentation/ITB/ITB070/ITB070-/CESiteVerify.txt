If you are registering into the OSG, be sure to check the appropriate box for which grid catalog you are registering with. You should receive an email response automatically back from the GOC to the operations contact you supplied.

This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make site and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.
