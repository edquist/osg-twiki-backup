---++CE Shutdown Guide
%EDITTHIS%

---+++/etc/xinetd.d services
Ensure that you've disabled the Globus Gatekeeper and <nop>Integration.GridFTP from inetd or xinetd.  If you are using xinetd, you can do
<pre>
&gt; chkconfig globus-gatekeeper off
&gt; chkconfig gsiftp off
</pre>
In VDT 1.6.1 and later, all services (<i>/etc/init.d, /etc/xinetd.d, cron</i>) should be turned on/off using the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-control</i> script.  This section will provide just a general overview. There is a <i>man</i> page available for the script, just type "man vdt-control". You can also [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.6.1/man/vdt-control.html read the man page online]]
If you do not have chkconfig, edit <i>/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper</i> and <i>/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp</i>, and set disable = yes.

If you are using inetd, then edit inetd.conf, and comment out the lines for globus-gatekeeper and gsiftp.  

Lastly, restart xinetd and inetd by:
To view all services controlled by <i>vdt-control</i>:
&gt; /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
            or
&gt; /etc/init.d/inetd restart
gratia-condor      | cron   | enable
</pre>

---+++/etc/init.d services
The OSG starts up several daemons.  If you try to re-install/upgrade the OSG without shutting them down, it may fail.  Run the following commands to turn off the OSG services before upgrading (see sample shutdown session below):
d45 2
To shutdown <b>all</b> services:
<pre>
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;   /etc/init.d/gris stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/mysql  stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/globus-ws stop
&gt;   /etc/init.d/MLD stop 

&gt;   /etc/init.d/apache stop     <b><i>(if CEMon has been activated)</i></b>
&gt;   /etc/init.d/tomcat-5stop   <b><i>(if CEMon has been activated)</i></b>

&gt;   /etc/init.d/condor stop   <b><i>(or other installed job manager)</i></b>
&gt; vdt-control --off
&gt; <b>vdt-control --off </b>
For OSG 0.4.1 or prior, there is a CRL update service that needs to be stopped.  In OSG 0.5.0+ releases, this is a crontab and is addressed in that section.
---++ Shutdown other services
&gt;   /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded stop 
&gt; vdt-control --off  Service
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
---+++crontabs
For OSG 0.4.1 and prior releases, the <i>root</i> cron processes that should be commented out are:
<verbatim>
0 0 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
</verbatim>
For <i>/etc/xinetd.d</i> services, the script will be removed from the directory.  The <i>xinetd.d</i> daemon will be restarted.
For OSG 0.5.0 and beyond, the <i>root</i> cron processes that should be commented out are:
<verbatim>
34 5 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
0 0 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
</verbatim>
For <i>/etc/init.d</i> services, the script will be removed from the directory and the service will be stopped.
For OSG 0.5.0 and earlier releases, the <i>mis</i> cron entry for MIS-CI can be removed by executing the following:
<pre>
&gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh    <b><i>(for OSG 0.5.0 and earlier releases)</i></b>
       or
&gt; crontab -r -u mis
</pre>
==/etc/xinetd.d== services can be disabled by either removing the service configuration from the ==/etc/xinetd.d== direcotry, or setting ==disable=yes== in the service's ==/etc/xinetd.d== configuration file and restarting xinetd.
an OSG 0.4.1 Installation please note also the old [[ReleaseDocumentation.OSGShutdownGuide][OSG 0.4.1 Shutdown Guide]]



---+++Additional considerations

---++++<nop>MySql / <nop>Integration.MonALISA / Globus web services
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww | grep -i monalisa

&gt;  <b>ps -efwww | grep -i monalisa </b>
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww | grep -i mysql
       or
&gt;  ps -efwww  | grep -i post[master,gres]

<pre class="screen">
If you are running a Rocks cluster, be sure to kill only the OSG-related mysql processes and avoid inadvertently stopping any cluster-related ones.  In general, pay attention if you need to kill any database-related processes explicitly; for example, look to make sure they are related to !Integration.MonALISA or Globus web services,  and/or are running out of your VDT installation area before stopping them.
If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you shouldremove the <i>/etc/init.d/MLD</i> link if it exists, as this will link to the <i>ML_SER</i> in your old <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i>.
If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you shouldr emove the <i>/etc/init.d/MLD</i> link if it exists, as this will link to the <i>ML_SER</i> in your old <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i>.


---++++If VOMS and/or GUMS is Running on Machine
This is not recommended.<br>
The process involves bringing down the tomcat servlet container, the included apache distribution, and mysql server.
If you are shutting down in order to prepare for a new OSG install *in a different directory*, you shouldr emove the =/etc/init.d/MLD= link if it exists, as this will link to the <i>ML_SER</i> in your old <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i>.

<pre>
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/tomcat-5 stop
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/apache stop
 &gt;  /etc/init.d/mysql stop
&gt;  <b>/etc/init.d/tomcat-5 stop </b>
&gt;  <b>/etc/init.d/apache stop </b>
&gt;  <b>/etc/init.d/mysql stop </b>
</pre>
