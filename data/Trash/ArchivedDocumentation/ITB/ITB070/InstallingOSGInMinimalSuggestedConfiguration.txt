---+ Installing OSG in the Minimal Suggested Configuration
%STARTINCLUDE%
To be reliable, an OSG site, which includes both cluster and headnodes, must have at least two headnodes: one for the CE and one for the minimal SE configuration.

In this implementation, we suggest that large-scale data movement to go via the _Default SE_, transferring via the CE any small output files (O(a few MB)) that are directly retrieved by condor-g.

---++ To deploy the suggested minimal configuration
Follow the "Single Headnode Cluster" configuration above but separate components as follows:

   1. Install the CE on headnode 1.<sup>[[#FootMinimaConfig1][1]]</sup>
   2. Install the gridftp server on headnode 2.<sup>[[#FootMinimaConfig2][2]]</sup>
   3. On headnode 2, export all file systems.

   1. <a name="FootMinimaConfig1"></a>You must point "myheadnode.athome.edu" in the specification of "Default SE" to the nodename of headnode 2, the one that instantiates the gsiftp server.
   1. <a name="FootMinimaConfig2"></a>The CE installation will also install a gridftp server. However, that gftp server will not be advertised in any way shape or form. It is required because the condor-g client uses it to retrieve those files that are specified in the jdl as output files. Condor-g implicitly assumes that the host that runs the GRAM also runs gsiftp.

---++ OSG Compliance
This installation implements [[LocalStorageRequirements050#Grid3Model][Grid3 Model configuration]] and is thus OSG compliant.
