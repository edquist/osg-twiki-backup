   * Syslog-ng comes preconfigured to forward the following logfiles to a collection host at UC.  It is not installed by default - you have to install and configure it using instructions [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Integration/VTBSyslogNG][here]].
   * After you've finished the install/config, it will begin forwarding logfile data automatically.  Send an email to Suchandra so that he can either verify that your site is forwarding log entries to the vtb/itb central logging host and/or create an account for you in the php-syslog-ng interface at http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/php-syslog-ng/ 
   * Upon receiving confirmation from Suchandra, enter  %Y% in the validation table for your site if you had him confirm your log entries
   * Alternatively, you can check the php-syslog-ng interface to make sure that your host is sending log messages to the server ( there is a delay before hosts will appear since the host information is cached )
   * Also check /tmp/syslog-ng.log and check the log statistics entries to verify that messages were sent to the central host (e.g.   =processed='destination(central_dest)=2031'= where the number is non-zero )
