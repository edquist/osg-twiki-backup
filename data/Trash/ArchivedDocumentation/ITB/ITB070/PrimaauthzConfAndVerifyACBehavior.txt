---++ Issue

When the =verifyAC= attribute is set to 'true' (default), it checks the directory specified by the =issuerCertDir= attribute (default is =/etc/grid-security/vomsdir=) for a certificate of trusted VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMSes.

If the submitter's proxy is not from one of the trusted VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS, it is treated as a grid proxy and the FQAN in the proxy is ignored. The authorization request is still forwarded to the GUMS authorization service. If the submitter exists in a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo that allows grid proxies, the authorization service will return a =PERMIT=.

This behavior is the same for _pre-ws_ and _ws prima_ authorizations.

At least one certificate must exist in this directory regardless of the =verifiyAC= setting. Your host cert will make do, but =verifyAC= _must_ be set to =false=. At least this way, VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS and GRID proxies will be treated correctly.

%NOTE% This is the same behavior as with pre-ws prima. The only difference is that pre-ws prima does not require the directory to exist with any certificate in it.

The problem is that both ws and pre-ws should function identically when the verifyAC is set to false. The ws prima should not require the existence of the directory and 'any" certificate to function properly.
