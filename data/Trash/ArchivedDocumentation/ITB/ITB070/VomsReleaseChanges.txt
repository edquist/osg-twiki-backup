---+ VOMS changes for this release
%EDITTHIS%

---++ 64 bit support
VOMS nows runs on 64-bit computers. However, there are some known problems with VOMS Admin.

VOMS Admin is the web interface to VOMS. VDT 1.7.1 has version 1.2.19-2-pre2-0. There have been persistent failures when installing VOMS Admin on Fedora Core 4, x86-64. Although this is not a widely used platform, the problems are not well understood and it is not known if they will manifest elsewhere.

If you install VOMS Admin and the installation fails while installing VOMS:

<pre class="programlisting">
Package [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VOMS] not [installed]: 
Package [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VOMS] has not been installed.  Can't setup. 
Package [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VDT] not [installed]:
Package  [/opt:vdt.caches:http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_171_cache:VDT] has not been installed.  Can't setup.
</pre>

Look in the +$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log_. If you see an error like this while installing VOMS-Server, it may be the same problem and the VDT team would like to know about it. Contact them via email at vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org.

<pre class="programlisting">
ERROR [main] Could not update org.glite.security.voms.database.flavours.
          MySQLSequence$1@7745c859: update affected 0 rows. -  flavours.MySQLSequence
ERROR [main] Internal database inconsistency detected:

         -  database.Database
         Database deployment failed.  Inspect above messages for an explanation.
</pre>

Also, VOMS Admin 1.2.19-2-pre2-0 contains a known bug ([[https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=13863][https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=13863]])for which VDT has installed a workaround. However, the workaround disables the automatic request clean-up feature. It is hoped a that this will be resolved in a subsequent release before any automatic clean-ups would occur.
