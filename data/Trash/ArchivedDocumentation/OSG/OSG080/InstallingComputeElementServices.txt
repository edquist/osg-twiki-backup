---++ Introduction to CE installation

Now you're ready to start installing the Compute Element (CE) services.  We distinguish between software that must be installed on the CE head node and software which must be executable from the worker nodes.  Note:
   * If you've just installed the workernode client on your CE, log out and log back in again so that your PATH doesn't become confused.
   * This section addresses the software executed on the CE (server/gatekeeper node).  

---++ Shutdown existing installations
If you have an existing CE installed and running, you *must* do a complete shutdown and confirm that all processes associated with it have been stopped.  Refer to  [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationShuttingDownCE][Shutting Down]] for details.

%IMPORTANT% Remember you are not shutting down this version, so choose the correct link in that section for the specific version you are replacing.  Be sure all services and crons are disabled.

---++ Create an installation directory 
Create a directory such as =/opt/osg-%VERSION%= and create a sym link =/opt/osg= that points to this directory. Please *do not* install in a directory like /opt or /usr, because the installation will create a slew of subdirectories. 

---++ Install the compute element
The installation described here is done as root even though services will not necessarily run as root:
   * A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed.   %BR%  Please answer *y* (yes) so that the software can be retrieved.
   * Finally, make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable.

%NOTE% For OSG-RSV, if you want to use a pre-existing Condor *6.9.x* installation, be sure the following variable is set appropriately, otherwise the VDT will bring down a full installation of all the condor-devel (i.e. Condor 6.9.4) binaries. 
   * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_DEVEL_LOCATION==: the location of your Condor 6.9.x installation (e.g. =/opt/condor-6.9.3=). The Condor =bin/=, =sbin/=, =etc/=, =lib/= ...  directories should be directly under this location.
      * Note that adding this additional environment variable will likely *not* work _if your existing production Condor install (pointed to by ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION==) is the same as the one pointed to by the ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_DEVEL_LOCATION== variable_. If that happens to be the case, the RSV developers and the VDT recommend that you allow Condor-Devel to install -- it will be a separate Condor 6.9.x running on your machine, but should not interfere with your pre-installed Condor in any way.

The following pacman command will install the package:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>pacman -get %CACHE%:ce</b>    
</pre>

See the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationPacmanBestPractices][Pacman section]] of this guide if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message.

%NOTE% This will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending upon the system and network connection. During this time you may open a second terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log= file.

You should not be asked any other questions during the installation process. The installation should complete with the following message:
<pre class="screen">
Downloading [site-verify-1.0-90.tar.gz] from [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software///site-verify/1.0]...

Pacman Installation of %CACHE%-%VERSION% Complete
</pre>

---++ Setup the OSG environment
 Assuming the Pacman install completed without errors, you should now be able to source the OSG environment. In your installation directory, from here forward known as the <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i>, source the setup script:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source setup.sh</b>
      <em>OR</em>
# <b>source setup.csh</b>
</pre> 

---++ Install job managers

You need to install an extra package to interface with your existing Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE installation.  Before proceeding, please consider:

%NOTE% For the Globus-PBS-Setup package, make sure your binaries are in the path prior to installation.  The install will fail silently with error reported to =vdt-install.log= and jobmanager-pbs will not be created.  If this is done, do a =<userinput>pacman -remove %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup</userinput>=, insert the binaries into your PATH and install again.

%NOTE% For Globus-Condor-Setup, if you want to use a pre-existing Condor installation, be sure the following variables are set appropriately, otherwise the VDT will bring down a full installation of all the condor binaries:  To specify an external Condor installation set the following two environment variables before installing:
   * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION==: the location of your Condor installation (e.g. =/opt/condor=). The Condor =bin/=, =sbin/=, =etc/=, =lib/= ...  directories should be directly under this location.
   * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG==: _(optional)_ The location of your Condor configuration file (if non-standard). Default is =${VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION}/etc/condor_config=

Now, *%BLUE% ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path,%ENDCOLOR%* and then install the appropriate package in your =$VDT_LOCATION= directory (for Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE respectively).  To install, run the appropriate command in the following list  (see notes following on SGE and PBS as needed):  
<pre class="screen">
# <b>pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-Condor-Setup</b>
# <b>pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup</b>
# <b>pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-LSF-Setup</b>
# <b>pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-SGE-Setup</b>
</pre>

Any of the packages Globus-XXX-Setup will include web-services (Globus-WS-XXX-Setup) and Gratia probes.  This guide will not go into the detail on the installation of any of these packages.

---++ Post install README
Read the =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= file. We suggest that you read the file for information only, and follow the instructions in the various OSG installation guides presented in these pages, rather than those in the VDT README file.
