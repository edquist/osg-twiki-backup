---++ Introduction
The OSG_APP storage agea is the base location for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-specific application software and holds VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo-wide software installations. 

OSG_APP is read-only mounted on all worker nodes in the cluster. Only users with software installation privileges in their VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo should have write privileges to this directories. At least 10 GB of space should be allocated per VO. 

Relative paths must be consistent between gatekeeper and worker nodes, even if the base OSG_APP directory differ. However, we strongly recommend making the base directory the same in both. Failing to do so may mean that some legacy software will not function properly.  

This area may be writable only by a subset of users and read-only for all the others: there is no guarantee that every user will have write access.  OSG_APP must point to a POSIX-compliant filesystem for software installation. 

To improve basic security and robustness, we recommend that only specific users and/or VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo roles have write access to OSG_APP. We recommend enabling the 'sticky bit' on OSG_APP for all shared CE storages.

---++ Typical uses of OSG_APP
   * Install and run VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo applications

---++ Notes
Pacman resolves variables an symbolic links saving the full real path. The following may help you avoid problems with it:
   * Choose any absolute location on your gatekeeper file system for OSG_APP.
   * On each worker node arrange by mount or symlink that OSG_APP has the same path as on the gatekeeper node.   
   * Install applications only using the fork jobmanager.
