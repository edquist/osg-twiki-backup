---++ Why interoperation with EGEE?

"The OSG Consortium builds and operates the OSG. The Consortium was formed in 2004 to bring resources and researchers from universities and national laboratories together to give scientists from many fields access to shared resources worldwide."  (<a href="http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Who_is_the_Open_Science_Grid%3F">Source</a>)  Interoperation with EGEE will allow scientists access to the OSG shared resources, helping to fulfill one of OSG's goals.
