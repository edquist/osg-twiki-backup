The definition of a validated, interoperable Storage Element (SE) will not be final until the OSG 1.0 cycle.  The following steps are the bare minimum required to validate a Compute Element (CE).

   * Site admins can verify the following:
      1. Does their site show up in the ITB BDII? <br> =ldapsearch -xLLL -h is-itb.grid.iu.edu -p 2170 -b o=grid '(<nop>GlueSiteDescription=*OSG*)' <nop>GlueSiteName | grep ^Glue=
      2. Does the site appear in http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/show_ldap_info_pps.cgi?
      3. Does the site show up in the EGEE PPS BDII? <br> =ldapsearch -xLLL -h pps-bdii.cern.ch -p 2170 -b o=grid '(<nop>GlueSiteDescription=*OSG*)' <nop>GlueSiteName | grep ^Glue= 

   * Interoperability staff can verify:
      1. Does the output from CEMon match what is served through the BDII?

   * If the above steps are validated, an OPS VO member with access to a gLite WN can verify the following:
      1. Does glite-job-list-match return the site if the sole requirement is <pre>other.GlueCEInfoHostName == "foo.bar.edu"</pre>
      2. Does a simple "hello world" job succeed submitted through the WMS?
<p>
Further tests to determine validation are currently being developed.
