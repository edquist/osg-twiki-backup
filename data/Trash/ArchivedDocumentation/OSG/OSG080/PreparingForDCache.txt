---++ Introduction
dCache is a disk-caching system jointly developed by Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). Although it was initially developed to provide disk caching for tertiary storage, dCache makes an excellent grid Storage Element (SE) &ndash; even without tape backend &ndash; because it gives us a single name space across the entire pool of disk servers, making it look like a single, giant disk system to the users. It also simplifies administration by providing mechanisms for internal clean-up and load balancing, which give you efficient use of your storage space and handling of the users' requests.

There is a VDT-based installation of dCache.

See [[Documentation/StorageDcacheOverview][Overview of dCache for OSG]] for information.

---++ Integration with the information system
Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. The SE does not collect or publish information independently.
