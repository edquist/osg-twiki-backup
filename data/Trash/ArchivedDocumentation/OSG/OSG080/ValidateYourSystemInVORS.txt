---++ VORS Location

VORS is located [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu][here]]. You will be added to VORS when you register your site at the GOC and attend the Operations call to represent your site.

---++ Explanation of VORS Methods

VORS uses the site_verify.pl, located locally at $VDT_LOCATION/verify/ to run site level testing using the MIS VO. Failure (Red) indicates one of the following conditions. 
   * Failure to Authenticate (Check globus-gatekeeper.log at $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log for hints)
   * Failure to Run a Fork Job (Check globus-gatekeeper.log at $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/globus-gatekeeper.log for hints)
   * Failure to Find a Job Manager (Check Job Manager specific log files)
   * Failure to Transfer files with GSIFTP correctly (Check $VDT_LOCATION/globus/var/gridftp.log)

---++ VORS Documentation
