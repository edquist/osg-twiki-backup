To register the resource with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the GOC's [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][webform]]. If you have previously registered your resource with the OSG there is no need to fill out this form. If you are registering into the OSG, be sure to check the appropriate box for which grid catalog you are registering with. You should receive an email response automatically back from the GOC to the operations contact you supplied. If this response doesn't arrive within an hour, please resubmit your registration or contact the GOC for further assistance.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a resource to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make resource and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.
