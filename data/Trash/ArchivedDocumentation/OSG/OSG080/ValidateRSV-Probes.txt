---++ Instructions for validating RSV
   * See the instructions on the  [[http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/rsv-testing.html#probes-only][RSV]] site for testing the probes. 
      * Note: if you've installed the complete RSV package as outlined in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB_0_7/ValidateRSV][Validating RSV Infrastructure]], then you can skip step 1 in the above instructions page, and use the probes installed in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/probes= to test them.
      * Follow steps in [[http://peart.ucs.indiana.edu/docs/osg/rsv-testing.html#probes-only][above link]] to test the probes.
   * Additional Hints:
      * If you're testing individual probes, then try to make sense out of the probe name as most of them are self explanatory; 
         * If in doubt, type perl =./some-name-probe -h= on the command line, and you'll get a complete description of the probe along with its command line options
         * Check if the tests actually work; are you seeing meaningful success/failure results being displayed in the =detailsData= line of the probe output?
         * Hint: If you find any errors in the probes, or other issues, then please execute the probe command with an additional switch =--verbose=
   * If these tests succeed, make %Y% entry in the validation table for your site.
   * If these tests are not clear, please send email to Arvind Gopu and cc osg-int@opensciencegrid.org.
