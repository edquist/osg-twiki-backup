---++ What is Pacman?

Pacman is a tool to install software. Conceptually you can think of it as being like "yum", if you are familiar with that tool. Pacman looks at web-accessible descriptions of packages in [[SoftwareCaches][software caches]] and installs the software that is needed. You can ask for individual software packages to be installed or sets of packages. 

---++ When do we use Pacman?

We use Pacman for all OSG installations except for dCache. 

---++ When don't we use Pacman?

We do not use Pacman for the VDT dCache installation.
