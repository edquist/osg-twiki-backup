---++ Introduction

The OSG and ITB caches both provide squid pacman packages.  Squid is a web caching service that speeds up downloads from http servers by locally caching files and serving the cached files rather than retrieving the files over the internet.  Due to the disk and memory requirements for squid, the typical use case would be for squid to be installed on a single server on a cluster with CE nodes using that server to proxy http and https requests.  Tests that were done in the ITB with Squid server on the same node as the CE led to rapid crash of the CE, therefore it is strongly recommended to install the Squid server on a different node from the gatekeeper.

%RED%Is there a particular location on the node into which you should install squid? Should you be root?%ENDCOLOR%

Squid is installed via pacman; first [[PacmanInstall][install pacman]], if not already done.

---++ Download and Installation
Install squid using the following command:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>pacman -get %CACHE%:squid </b>
</pre>

%RED%Is there a setup script that can set this dir as VDT_LOCATION?%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Configuration

If your site is using a squid server, you can indicate by answering appropriately while answering the questions that configure-osg.sh  asks.  In particular, you will need to answer =y= to the question asking if squid is being used and give the hostname of the server that squid is running on.  

%RED%This makes it sound like there might be more than just this one config answer. Is there more?%ENDCOLOR%

%IMPORTANT% If you indicate that squid is running on the localhost, squid will need to be installed using the instructions above, otherwise =configure-osg.sh= will not be complete the configuration of the system.
