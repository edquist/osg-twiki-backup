%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%

*Purpose*:   The purpose of this document is to provide [[Storage.BeStMan][BeStMan]] based SE administrators the information on how to prepare, install and validate the SE. 

---++ Preparation
---+++ Introduction
Berkeley Storage Manager ([[Storage.BeStMan][BeStMan]]) is a full implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, for a small disk based storage and mass storage systems such as HPSS. End users may have their own personal [[Storage.BeStMan][BeStMan]] that manages and gives an SRM interface to their local disks. It works on top of existing disk-based unix file systems, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, PVFS, AFS, GFS, and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp. It requires minimal administrative efforts on the deployment and updates. If storage spans on multiple file systems and storage systems, [[ReleaseDocumentation.DCache][SRM/dCache]] should be considered.

---+++ Integration with the information system
Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. See the topic [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Providers]]. The SE does not collect or publish information independently.
