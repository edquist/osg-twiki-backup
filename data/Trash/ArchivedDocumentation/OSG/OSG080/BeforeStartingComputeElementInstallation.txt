   * You have already read the [[SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] and know the other servers that will be necessary to get your site going.
   * You are installing as *root*.
      * Paraphrasing from the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_think.html][VDT site]]: If you install as root, the VDT's programs can be made available to all the users on your system. Additionally, the VDT will be able to configure and start some of the grid services you might be installing.  Some services can only be run if you are root. 
      * Corollary: If you don't install as root, you CAN'T do these things.
      * But *do not* install anything under the =/root= directory!
   * You know how to setup and administer a cluster, if needed.  You don't?  Start with [[SiteFabricBestPractices]]. (We don't provide full documentation on this.)
   * You will use [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] to install 
   * You are installing onto a [[OperatingSystems][supported operating system]]
   * You have a supported batch system (Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE) installed on your machine, in a location different from where you plan to install the OSG CE software.  If not, instructions on [[StandaloneCondorInstallation][Condor Installation]]  are available.
   * You have a [[UserCertificate][PKI X509 user certificate]].  You'll need it to run tests. 
   * You have applied for the [[GetHostCertificates][Host and Service Certificates]] that your machine will need.
   * You have thought about the configuration values needed (OSG group, resource name, server location, local storage locations, and so on).  You haven't?  See [[PrepareForComputeElementConfigure]] and [[LocalStorageConfiguration]].
