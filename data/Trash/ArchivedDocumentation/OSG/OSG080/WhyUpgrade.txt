---++ Summary
*OSG %OSG_VERSION%* is based on *VDT %VDT_VERSION%* which contains several new features and bug-fixes from previous versions. For a comprehensive list of changes VDT Version 1.8.1, see *[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.8.1/release.html][VDT upgrades from 1.8.0 to 1.8.1]]*.  Most sites we suspect will be upgrading from OSG 0.6 which was based on VDT 1.6.1, see: *[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.8.0/release.html][VDT Upgrades from 1.6.1 to 1.8.0]]*.  Here is a brief summary of the most significant changes in OSG 0.8.0:
   1 New: RSV service - the resource service validation infrastructure
   1 New: Update of generic information providers (GIP) to Glue schema 1.3 
   1 New: lcg-info, lcg-infosites:  client tools for the BDII information service
   1 New: Glexec available in workernode-client
   1 New: Syslog-ng, an optional service for log file forwarding, that can be used for helping troubleshoot OSG services by the OSG troubleshooting team.
   1 VDT-Client available on Mac OS X
   1 Improvements to CA certificate distribution:
      * Automatic certificate updates
      * Alternative: RPM with or without YUM. See further http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.8.1/certificate_authorities.html
   1 New: Condor NFS lite, and optional implementation for reducing load on NFS servers 
   1 New platform support: !RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 and !CentOS 5
   1 New: VOMRS now in VDT
   1 New: Bestman storage element
   1 New: Support for SGE job manager for WS GRAM
   1 New: Grid Exerciser - for exercising OSG services
   1 New: Pegasus workflow planner 

---++ Highlights
---+++ RSV
There is a new package, OSG-Site-Validate, which will help OSG
    site administrators check if their sites are operating
    correctly. Although the phrase "OSG" is in the title and it was
    developed for OSG sites, it's useful by non-OSG sites
    as well because most of the tests are non-OSG specific. 

For WLCG OSG sites: RSV will be the collection infrastructure for reporing site availability monitoring information to the WLCG SAM system.  Collected RSV probe output in the GOC RSV collector will be forwarded to the WLC-SAM service.  For more information, see SiteAvailabilityMonitoringForWLCG. 

---+++ Information services  
The Glue schema has been updated to v 1.3.  This is required to maintain interoperability with EGEE sites.  New client tools from EGEE,  =lcg-info=, =lcg-infosites= (lcg-info 1.11.0-1 and lcg-infosites 2.6-2) have been added. These allow easy querying of any BDII service. The OSG GOC maintains a  BDII service for all OSG sites.

Additionally, information gathered by the GIP is advertised to the OSG Resource Selection Service (!ReSS) to make CE information available in !ClassAd format.  

---+++ Gratia probes
The Gratia PBS and LSF probe is now compiled on all supported platforms. This should resolve problems people had when the probe didn't work due to failed dynamic linking.

---+++ Glexec
Glexec 0.1 has been added, <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;q=1518">(VDT Ticket 1518)</a>.

---+++ Syslog-ng
    Syslog-ng is now part of the VDT, and it is installed alongside
    any existing syslog daemon that might be on your system. (Assuming
    you install it at all, that is.) OSG is likely to use syslog-ng to
    collect centralized logs for troubleshooting purposes. 
  
---+++ Globus 4.0.5
    We are now using Globus 4.0.5.  This release incorporates many (but not all)
    of the patches that we used to apply to Globus.  In particular, it
    incorporates nearly all of the &ldquo;community branch&rdquo; (for TeraGrid)
    changes that we used apply as a set of patches.  This change will make it
    easier to maintain our Globus build.  Also, WS-GRAM received a number of
    fixes to improve reliability and scalability.  You can
    <a href="/patches/1.7.1/">see our patches to Globus</a>. <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;q=2721">(VDT Ticket 2721)</a>
  
---+++ Mac OS X client
 Starting with VDT 1.8.1, VDT supports a subset of client tools on Mac OS X 10.4 running on Apple Intel hardware. To date, we have performed light, manual testing of the following components against a VDT-installed gatekeeper.
   * Condor-G
   * Basic Globus client tools, including grid-proxy-init, globus-job-run, and globus-url-copy
   * !GridFTP
   * !UberFTP
   * GSI-OpenSSH
   * VOMS client tools, including voms-proxy-init and voms-proxy-info 

Note: You can get all of these components at once by installing the VDT-Client (or OSG-Client) package.


---+++ Java 5
    Java 5 is now the default instead of Java 4, except for web applications
    running in Tomcat 5.0. <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;q=2718">(VDT Ticket 2718)</a>

---+++ VOMS
    VOMS nows runs on 64-bit computers.
 
---+++ GLOBUS_LOCATION
    For OSG installations, batch job managers (Condor, PBS, SGE, and LSF) will
    reset GLOBUS_LOCATION for jobs based on OSG_GRID.  This allows
    GLOBUS_LOCATION to be different for the gatekeeper and the worker nodes.
    This has been tested on all platforms, but it might not be working on LSF
    &mdash; the current behavior on LSF seems to simply not change
    GLOBUS_LOCATION, so it is no worse than it used to be.

---+++ CA certificates
    There is now an RPM for installing the CA certificates.  It has been lightly
    tested.  If you want to use it, it&rsquo;s best to tell the VDT not to
    install the CA certificates at all, and then just use the RPM.
  
---+++ VDT-UPDATE-CERTS
    There is now a program, vdt-update-certs, for automatically updating the CA
    Certificates.  It is a cron job that is optionally enabled.  <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/%VDT_VERSION%/notes/CA-Certificates-Updater.html">View the documentation</a>.

---+++ Tomcat
    The way in which web applications are installed into Tomcat 5.0 and 5.5 is
    now more robust and more consistent with Tomcat best practices.

---+++ Pacman
    Pacman %PACMAN_VERSION% is now the minimum supported version of Pacman.  Since v3.20 Pacman is
    substantially faster than previous versions of Pacman, which makes a OSG/VDT install faster.
  
---+++ VOMRS
VOMRS installed for VOMS administrators:

    <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;q=2612">(VDT Ticket 2612)</a>

---+++ Condor-NFSLite Job Manager
See %VDT_DOCS_URL%/notes/Globus-CondorNFSLite-Setup.html
    <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/rt/index.html?user=guest&amp;pass=guest&amp;q=2479">(VDT Ticket 2479)</a>

This can be used by systems administrators to check out their sites.
