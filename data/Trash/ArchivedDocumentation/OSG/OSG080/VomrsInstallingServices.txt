---++ hosts file considerations
The /etc/hosts file should be set up to list the external FQAN of the vom(r)s server separately from the localhost line, for example:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost</b>
&gt; <b>123.45.67.89 myvoms.example.edu myvoms</b>
</pre>
Placing the FQAN in the localhost line will cause the installation to fail.

---++ Installation user
Must be done as _root_ user.

---++ Installation package
After installing pacman:

<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd <i>PACMAN_DIR</i></b>
# <b>source setup.sh</b>
</pre>

---++ Installation location
Wherever you like.  Shown below as as the VDT_LOCATION variable.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>VDT_LOCATION=/usr/local/osg</b>
# <b>mkdir $VDT_LOCATION</b>
</pre>

<font color="orange">Note by A. Sill: I found it necessary to also define ahead of time a soft link from /etc/grid-security/certificates to this $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA before proceeding with the installation, in order to avoid certain startup problems and error messages in the resulting services.  Not sure why this is so, and it should be fixed to eliminate this workaround.</font>

---++ Installation Cache
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION
# pacman -get  %CACHE%:vomrs  
</pre>

---++ Installation output/questions
%NOTE% Some of the questions related to 'trusted caches' and 'unrecognized platforms' may not appear depending on your host and any _pacman_ variables already set in your environment.

VDT 1.8.1 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.8.1

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] <b>y</b>

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.

<b>y</b>
-------------------------------------------------


If you would like, we can configure VOMRS to start automatically 
at boot time.

Enabling the VOMRS daemon requires 
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMRS server to run automatically?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.

If you would like, we can configure VOMS to start automatically 
at boot time.

Configuring the VOMS daemon requires 
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMS server to run automatically?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b>r</b>
-------------------------------------------------


Do you want to run a cron job that will update the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Do you want to update the CA certification revocation lists (CRLs) automatically? [y/n]

Do you want to add [http://osg-vtb.uchicago.edu/vtb/] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>

Package [vomrs-181] found in [VTB]...
Do you want to add [http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_181_cache] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): <b>y</b>

---++ Verify the  installation completed successfully
To verify  the pacman installation was successful, there should be a setup.(c)sh in the VDT_LOCATION.   If present, source it.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source setup.sh</b>
</pre>

%IMPORTANT% This does not necessarily indicated that everything was installed and configured successfully.  It just verifies that the pacman installation completed successfully.  There is a lot of other magic that occurs during the process that should be validated.
