---+!! OSG Client Installation Instructions
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

The OSG Release uses the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.10/release.html][VDT]] for the client installation.

You do *not* need install the client package as =root=. Use the following commands to create a installation directory and perform the installation.

---++Install Pacman
See the [[PacmanInfo][pacman guide]].

   $ %I% %RED% *NOTE* %ENDCOLOR%: Pacman version 3.16.2 was used for testing of all components of version 0.3.6.

---++Install the client packages
To begin the installation, create an installation directory for the OSG Client.

<verbatim>
 $ mkdir ~/client_directory 
 $ cd ~/client_dirctory
 $ pacman -get OSG:client</verbatim>

During the installation you will be prompted to answer a few configuration questions. Common answers are provided below.

<pre>Do you want to add [http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n):</pre>

   $ %I% %RED% *NOTE* %ENDCOLOR%: You will be asked this question multiple times for different pacman cache locations, answer =y= each time.

  The VDT is unable to recognize your platform. This version of 
  the VDT is supported on several Linux releases:

   RedHat 7
   RedHat 9
   RedHat Enterprise Linux 3
   Fedora Core 3
   Debian 3.1
   ROCKS 3.3
   Fermi Scientific Linux 3.0
 
  The VDT may work on other platforms, but it's not guaranteed. If you
  encounter problems and send mail to the VDT team for support please

   VDT 1.3.10 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
   In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
   You can view the licenses online at:
   
        http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.3.10
   
   After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
   view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

If you would like, we can configure the Condor batch system to
Answer =y= to start up the Condor.  This is a personal condor that is only for submitting jobs to remote sites.
   The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files 
   for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to 
   perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have 
   service/host certificates signed by these CA's).
   
   For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
   http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html
   
   Where would you like to install CA files?
   
   Choices:
           l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
           n (no)    - do not install</pre>
Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, w
Press =l= (the letter l) to select the location for the certificates.

Answer =l= (lowercase "L") so that the CA files will be installed inside of your installation directory.
The client will complete with the following output:
<pre>
   The VDT version 1.3.10 has been installed.</pre>

You can =source setup.csh=  or =. setup.sh= to get all the client tools into your $PATH.
</pre>

You will need a personal grid certificate to run validation tests. See the [[Integration.ITB_0_5.CertScripts#FAQ][directions for obtaining a certificate]]. If you still have questions on getting a personal certificate, or don't know how to generate a grid proxy (=grid-proxy-init=, etc.), contact your [[http://www.grid.iu.edu/osg-includes/sc.php][VO Support Center]].


If you want to submit jobs using the Personal Condor that comes as part of the client tool, read the =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= for information on how to start it up.  Pay specific attention to the "condor" script in that directory which can be used to start up condor at boot time.  Also note the =edg-crl-upgraded= startup script.  Without the edg-crl-upgraded script the Certificate Authority Certificate Revocation List files that 
are downloaded with the client will eventually expire and you will not be able to do any interactive globus-url-copycommands.

More details on how to start up the services are in the =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= for information on how to start it up.
