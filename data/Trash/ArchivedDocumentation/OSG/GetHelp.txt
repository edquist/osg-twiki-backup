If you discover shortcomings in documentation or help procedures, please invest a little time in documenting your issue and letting the party concerned know about it directly, or send it to _osg-docs_. We would appreciate it sincerely, as the first step to fixing a problem is knowing that it exists.

---++ For OSG software assistance, what information should you include?
When you make a request for assistance, please make sure to include your Operating System and OSG or VDT version. Even better, if your software installation is at least partly completed, you can use =vdt-system-profiler= to collect information about your system that may help debug the problem. 

Vdt-system-profiler creates a file called =vdt-profile.txt= in the current directory. This file contains all sorts of information that might be useful in debugging your problem. For example, it contains the OS, hostname, disk space, network interfaces, contents of /etc/grid-security, and the vdt-install.log, among other things. The program is a straightforward Bourne shell script, in case you're curious to see it.

The program requires VDT_LOCATION to be set, but has no other interesting requirements. If your setup file doesn't exist, you have to set VDT_LOCATION manually.

If you have a problem, submitting this file might help us shorten the debugging time a bit. Instead of us going back and forth asking questions like, "What OS are you running? What version of Pacman did you use? Are you out of disk space? Is your host multi-homed? What's in your vdt-install.log?" we can see those many of those answers up front.
