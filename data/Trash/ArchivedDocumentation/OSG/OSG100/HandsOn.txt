---++ Introduction
This page collects a series of short hands-on guides. They are not reference documents.  They are short guides created for the sessions during the August 09 Site Administrators meeting and can be used for tutorials or hands on sessions.

Notes for users:
   * Guides target is very specific
   * If you need something different you may try to adapt or go to the reference documentation
   * Add comments about your experience, your specific case

Some guidelines for authors:
   * Decide the story: be specific on the content (one release version, one purpose, one cluster configuration)
   * Be brief: only your specific case is covered (but refer more general instructions, see 3)
   * Refer reference documentation: the installation guides are more complete and cover all possibilities. People doing something different should know to go there. Software reference manuals will explain all possible options and uses.
   * Be hands-on: give instructions, add cut and paste friendly content
   * Check the styling guidelines below

---++ Styling guidelines
It is important to maintain some uniformity between the different hands-on guides and with the release documentation. Here are some suggestions:
   * Use an Introduction section where you specify the context of your hands-on document:
      * What it is
      * OSG release it refers to
      * Your setup (machines, operating system) and which other setups are supposed to work
   * End with a References section where you list some reference documentation. Naturally you are expect to have links also along the document
   * Attach documents that facilitate the hands-on session or are otherwise important: presentations, scripts, supporting data, examples
   * Embed in PDF format any document that you like viewed as presentation (one page at the time, with graphics not available in the wiki):
      * attach the document, a.g. =presentation.pdf=
      * add aline like =&lt;embed src="%<nop>ATTACHURL%/presentation.pdf" width="330" height="255"&gt;=
      * other recommended sizes are: 110x85, 792x612
   * Use the ="screen"= class for command sequences within the =pre= tag (=&lt;pre class="screen"&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt;=)
   * Avoid the user prompt (to ease cut and paste)
<pre class="screen">
echo "Example"
ls
</pre>
   * Include a section for *Comments* at the very end of the page, matching the style of the !ReleaseDocumentation.
