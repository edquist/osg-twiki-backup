%RED%Hello Peter. We are temporarily filling in. Please keep details posted here. <br> Current focus is only on 5 Persistent ITB sites. Thanks. -- ASR & RWG %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Introduction 

We won't be setting up an ITB site this time around, but I do have plans next week to run some tests against the existing ITB sites.

---++ Known issues

I did a quick check and I already know I can't authenticate against a few of them.  I was also hoping to run tests using a voms-proxy from our new, larger scope VO, !NEBioGrid, but unfortunately being a VO that was only formed a couple months ago, it isn't supported at most sites.
Actually, !NEBioGrid isn't supported at any of the Production or ITB sites last time I checked.  When I'm using an !NEBioGrid VOMS proxy, the few sites I can authenticate against map me to the sbgrid account, presumably because my grid certificate was issued by the SBGrid support center, and the site isn't honoring voms-proxies.

I can get you more information when I have more time next week, but so far I know my sbgrid voms-proxy doesn't work at:

BNL_ITB_Test1 gridtest01.racf.bnl.gov

CIT_ITB_1     cit-itb.ultralight.org

OUHEP_ITB     osgitb1.nhn.ou.edu

OSG_ITB_PSU   ligo-itb.aset.psu.edu

UCSDT2-ITB1   osg-gw-3.t2.ucsd.edu

CIGI-ITB      everest.cigi.uiuc.edu

IU_COBRA_ITB  cobra.uits.indiana.edu

LIGO_CIT      osg-ce.ligo.caltech.edu

And the only sites that the !NEBioGrid authenticates against are:

LBNL_DSD_ITB grolsch.lbl.gov

Purdue-ITB itb.rcac.purdue.edu

But, like I said, it maps to the sbgrid account, which isn't desired.
