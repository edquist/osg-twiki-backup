%RED%Hello Peter. We are temporarily filling in. Please keep details posted here. <br> Current focus is only on 5 Persistent ITB sites. Thanks. -- ASR & RWG %ENDCOLOR%

---++ Introduction 

We won't be setting up an ITB site this time around, but I do have plans next week to run some tests against the existing ITB sites.

---++ Known issues

Initial test notes:

Was able to successfully auth against the 5 Persistent ITB sites with an SBGrid voms proxy on Jul 15th.

 

_07/16/2009_

*LBNL_DSD_ITB*
I'm getting a "Word too long." error.
$ globus-job-run grolsch.lbl.gov /bin/tcsh -c 'echo $PATH'
Word too long.
Most versions of the tcsh shell have a PATH limit of 4096 characters.  It looks like there are 6124 chars in the PATH at the site.

*UC_ITB*
Unable to authenticate again.
$ globusrun -a -r uct3-edge7.uchicago.edu
GRAM Authentication test failure: authentication with the remote server failed

%RED% This has been fixed on UC_ITB.  There was an issue with the callout library which prevented authentication from occurring but I've corrected that and have verified that authentication is working correctly at this point -- Suchandra %ENDCOLOR%

07/17/2009, UC_ITB seems to be working okay for me now.  The Job Manager Coverage on the Twiki Validation page seems to say that UC_ITB has PBS and condor job managers, but I think it's just PBS.

*CIT_ITB_1*
The filesystem for $OSG_APP  is Read Only.
