---++ Validating Squid
To make sure the server is working:
   * Set =http_proxy= environment variable to =proxyhost:3128= (where proxyhost is the name if your squid server) and export it
   * Use wget with debugging to get a cachable web url, for example
      <pre>wget -d -O/dev/null http://www.fnal.gov</pre>
   * The first time you run it you should see not far from the end of the output a line beginning "X-Cache: MISS"
   * Run the same command again and you should instead see a line beginning "X-Cache: HIT"

To verify that it is working properly from a worker node:
   * run a grid job on the worker node (such as with globus-job-run or condor_submit) with the following commands in it:
      * =uname -a=
      * =export http_proxy=$OSG_SQUID_LOCATION:3128=
      * the above wget command twice
   * Verify that the job ran on a worker node and that "X-Cache: HIT" is present in the output from the second wget
