When you install the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS node, it comes with quite a bit of software.  This section will help you learn how to find out the details for yourself.

---++ Discovering which version of the OSG Software Stack you've installed.
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
&gt; <b>source setup.sh </b>
&gt; <b>./osg-voms-version </b>
VOMS deployed with OSG-ITB-1.10.1
</pre>

---++ Discovering exactly what software has been installed
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh </b>
&gt; <b>vdt-version </b>
VDT Version.... You have installed a subset of VDT version 1.10.1:
    Apache HTTPD 2.2.8
    CA Certificates v35 (includes IGTF 1.20 CAs)
    Fetch CRL 2.6.6
    GPT 3.2autotools2004-NMI-9.0
    Java 5 SDK 1.5.0_14
    Logrotate 3.7
    MySQL 4.1.22
    MySQL 5.0.51a
    MySQL Connector/J 5.0.6
    Apache Tomcat 5.5.25
    VOMS 1.8.3
    VOMS Admin 2.0.14-1
</pre>

---++ Finding all services that are part of your install
You can use the =vdt-control= command to see all services that are installed as part of the install, and whether or not they are enabled or disabled. For example:

<pre class="screen">
&gt; source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  vdt-control --list
Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs   | cron   | enable
mysql              | init   | enable
apache             | init   | enable
tomcat-55          | init   | enable
voms               | init   | enable
</pre>

For debugging purposes _only_, you can look at =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/services/state=. This file is automatically generated and should _not_ be edited by hand. It contains all the information used by vdt-control to start and stop services in the VDT. 

Below we break down the services that you can expect to be on your system. All of these are listed by =vdt-control=: they are broken down here in order to give you more information.

---++ The init.d services that are included
The services installed and enabled are:
| *Service* | *Description* |
| apache | In front of tomcat |
| tomcat-55 | used by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS WEB UI |
| mysql | Used by VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS |
| voms |  this is the voms server that services =voms-proxy-init= requests |

In addition, during the installation, a test VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo called =VDT= will be created  if  your host certificate is available before you install.  If the host certificate is not available, configuration of the =VDT= VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo will have to be performed separately.

---++ Cron jobs
Some cron jobs are installed with random times. Look at =crontab -l= to see which ones you have. Likely candidates are:

| *Cron Job* | *Description* |
| fetch-crl | Update the certificate authority revocation lists. Verify importation for security purposes |
| vdt-rotate-logs | Rotate log files periodically, to keep them from growing too large |
| vdt-update-certs | Updates your certificate authority certificates |

An example crontab file:
<i>root</i> cron
<pre class="programlisting">
48 5 * * * /usr/local/osg-voms/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.6/fetch-crl.cron
0 0 * * * /usr/local/osg-voms/vdt/bin/vdt-rotate-logs
37 * * * * /usr/local/osg-voms/vdt/sbin/vdt-update-certs-wrapper --vdt-install /usr/local/osg-voms --called-from-cron
</pre>

---++ Log file rotation
The following are the log files that are configured for rotation with the installation in 
=$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt.logrotate=:

<pre class="programlisting">
# Rotate daily
daily
# Keep a week's worth
rotate 7
# Compress old files
compress
compressoptions -9f
# Truncate, instead of moving, files to avoid problems with apps
copytruncate
# Just ignore it if they're not there
missingok
# Rotate these files
/usr/local/osg-voms/vdt/var/log/vdt-update-certs.log {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/vdt/var/log/vdt-update-certs.log.system_output {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/apache/logs/access_log {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/apache/logs/error_log {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/apache/logs/mod_jk.log {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/apache/logs/ssl_request_log {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/tomcat/v55/logs/catalina.out {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/glite/log/voms.VDT {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/glite/log/voms.oiv_test1 {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/glite/log/voms.oiv_test2 {}
/usr/local/osg-voms/glite/log/voms.oiv_test3 {}
