Note:  This page refers to the ldapsearch command.  The ldapsearch command is not part of the standard OSG installation, it is commonly
on many standard linux installations. If you do not have it and would like to get it
from the VDT it is part of the VDT OpenLDAP package that can be pulled using pacman
and refer to the VDT Package 'OpenLDAP.'

---++ Introduction
This document is written for end users.  It describes how to initialize the environment of your job to correctly access the execution and data areas on the worker node.

%WARNING% Storage definitions and implementations may not be consistent across OSG sites.

---++ Whats in wn-client?
You can see directly whats in the =wn-client= package for this release, %CACHE% %VERSION%:
   * http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/wn-client.pacman

Basically, it is:

   1 Our set of CA certificates.
   2 Basic VDT underlying infrastructure (like tools to install the VDT tarballs, keep track of files, etc.)
   3 Globus client tools. This is probably slightly more than we need: it includes tools like:
      * proxy management (create proxy, proxy info, destroy proxy)
      * job submission (pre-WS and WS)
      * data transfer (globus url copy, the !GridFTP client)
      * RLS client
   4 The Pegasus worker node software
   5 wget & curl: standard tools for downloading files with http and ftp. They're commonly pre-installed by the OS, but not consistently, so they are in the worker node client.
   6 !UberFTP: command-line client for !GridFTP
   7 SRM clients (v1 and v2)
   8 dccp, the dcache client
   9 !MyProxy. This is for the !MyProxy client tools, but the full !MyProxy is installed including the server. This is because the !MyProxy software isn't packaged in a way to easily distinguish client and server and we haven't pushed on making such a separation before.


---++ Storage Types Supported at OSG Sites
All OSG sites should support the following storage:

%EDITTABLE{ header="| *Name* | *What you can do* | *Notes* |" format="| text | textarea, 2x30 | textarea, 2x30 |" changerows="on" }%
| *Name* | *What you can do* | *Notes* |
| =$OSG_APP= | Install application software releases into via the CE. | After install, area is read-only accessible from all batch slots on your cluster. |
| =$OSG_SITE_READ= | Stage data to using gftp that is then readable from all batch slots. | %RED% OSG sites have not consistently deployed this area. %ENDCOLOR% |
| =$OSG_SITE_WRITE= | Stage output files to from all batch slots, for later asynchronous retrieval using gftp. | %RED% OSG sites have not consistently deployed this area. %ENDCOLOR% |
| =$OSG_DATA= | Data files that are accessible via NFS from all batch slots, read-write. | %RED% OSG sites have not consistently deployed this area %ENDCOLOR% |
| =$OSG_GRID= | Set of "client tools" that are part of the OSG software stack. | Available at batch slot |
| =$OSG_WN_TMP<sup>[[#FootOsgWnTmpImplementedPoorly][1]]</sup>= | Temporary storage area in which your job(s) run | Local to each batch slot |

#FootOsgWnTmpImplementedPoorly
   1. %RED%OSG sites have inconsistently implemented $OSG_WN_TMP.%ENDCOLOR%  The default configuration of OSG is to have a single top level $OSG_WN_TMP on each worker node which multiple jobs share simultaneously.  Good-citizen grid users are expected to make a subdirectory below this directory in which to execute their job.  For instance: =export mydir=$OSG_WN_TMP/myWorkDir$RANDOM ; mkdir $mydir ; cd $mydir= %BR%.  A significant number of sites use the batch system to make an independent directory for each user job, and change $OSG_WN_TMP on the fly to point to this directory.  In these cases they will usually advertise OSG_WN_TMP to be UNAVAILABLE.  A few other sites simply dump all user jobs into a cluster-wide NFS-shared directory, very bad practice indeed.

There is no way to know in advance how much scratch disk space any given worker node has available, as OSG information systems don't advertise this.  Often it is shared among a number of job slots.  If your job has significant I/O it is important to make the subdirectory
as above so you don't interfere with other jobs that may be using the node.


---++ Input and Output Files Specified via condor-g jdl
Condor-g allows specification of the following:

| =executable= | one file |
| =output= | one file - stdout | 
| =error= | one file - stderr |
| =transfer_input_Files= <sup>[[#ThirdNote][1]]</sup> | comma separated list of files |
| =transfer_output_files= <sup>[[#FourthNote][2]]</sup> | comma separated list of files |

%WARNING% <a name="ThirdNote"></a>Do not use to transfer more than a few megabytes: these files are transfered via the CE headnode and can cause serious loads, which can bring down the cluster. 
%WARNING% <a name="FourthNote"></a>Do not spool gigabyte-sized files via the CE headnode by condor file transfer. Space on the headnode tends to be limited, and some sites severely quota the gram scratch area via which these files are spooled. Instead, store them in the dedicated stage-out spaces and pull them from the outside as part of a DAG. 

In the remainder of this document we describe how to find your way around these various storage areas both from outside the site before you submit your job, as well as from inside the site after your job starts inside a batch slot.

---++ Finding your way around
%NOTE% A definition of the concepts used in this document can be found in [[LocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]], including a section describing minimal requirements and some sample configurations.

Here we describe how to find the various storage locations. We start by describing how to find things after your job starts, and then complete the discussion by describing what you can determine from the outside, before you submit a job to the site. We deliberately do not describe what these various storage implementations are. That is done in the [[LocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] document.

---++ Setting Up $OSG_GRID
All OSG sites should be configured so that the $OSG_GRID environment variable is already defined when your job starts running.
First see [[RunningSourceOsgGridSetupSh][Running "source osg_grid_setup.sh"]].

---+++ !!Getting Information About CE Storage Before You Submit a Job
OSG sites advertise their properties via the _Generic Information Provider (GIP)_. This information can be queried from outside the site. It is meant to be used to select sites that support the functionality you need for your applications. 

<!-- Pulls definition from Documentation.GlossaryOfTerms and puts it into a blue-bordered centered box. -->
%INCLUDE{ "Documentation.ToolsInsetInclude" section="GlossaryTerm" INCLUDETOPIC="Documentation.GlossaryG" TERM="Generic Information Provider" }%

The GIP uses the GLUE schema, and all information may be read via LDAP queries. The following fields are of particular importance in the context of storage:

%TABLE{ valign="top" }%  
| *GLUE Schema name* | *OSG Correspondence* | *Notes*  | 
| !GlueCEInfoApplicationDir | =$OSG_APP= |    |
| !GlueCEInfoDataDir | =$OSG_DATA= |     |
| Worker node client directory | =$OSG_GRID= | _Published with:_  %BR% !GlueLocationLocalID=OSG_GRID  %BR%   !GlueLocationName=OSG_GRID  %BR%   !GlueLocationPath= the path to the directory |

%NOTE% The GLUE schema allows the site to configure different paths for SITE_READ and SITE_WRITE and DEFAULT_SE for each VO. However, few sites are likely to do this as it requires manual editing of the schema file.

---+++ !!Selecting GLUE Schema Attribures Using =ldapsearch=
The following syntax for ldapsearch works to get all !GlueLocationLocalID &mdash; there are several &mdash; from fngp-osg.fnal.gov.
