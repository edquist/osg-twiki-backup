---++ Release Notes for the OSG 1.2.3 upgrade
This release is a minor upgrade to OSG 1.2 installations and is not critical except for sites using glexec or sites that run jobs that check the lcg-utils version. Release notes for the VDT packages that have been updated can be found [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p10.html][here]].  

---++ Update Instructions
If you have OSG 1.2 services installed you can update following the instructions below.  This applies to all OSG packages including the CE, client, wn-client, and other services.

If you have OSG 1.0 or earlier, you must do a new installation because OSG 1.2.x uses a different Pacman cache from prior releases.

There are installation guides for installing the various components available at the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/WebHome][release documentation web]]. In addition, for experienced admins, there is a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/QuickInstallGuide][streamlined installation guide]] available as well.

---++ Update Instructions from OSG 1.2.x to OSG 1.2.3

---+++ Preliminaries
You'll need to go to the directory where you installed your software and source the setup script so that the following steps will work correctly.
<pre class="screen">
cd [software location]
source setup.sh
</pre>


---+++ Stop VDT Services
Some packages (e.g. client or wn-client) may not be running any services, however, doing this step will not cause problems.  

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---+++ Backup your software
<pre class="screen">
cp -ar $VDT_LOCATION [BACKUP_LOCATION]
</pre>

---+++ Update the VDT updater script
If you do not yet have the updater script, then fetch it:

<pre class="screen">
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:VDT-Updater
</pre>

If you already have the updater, update it:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre>

Note: If you are not sure if you have the updater, look for VDT_LOCATION/vdt/update/vdt-updater 

---+++ Backup

You'll need to backup again since the vdt-updater script will request the location of your backup and verify that the backup is identical to the current contents of the install directory before updating your installation.
<pre class="screen">
cp -pr $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP-LOCATION
</pre> 

---+++ Get VDT Updates
<pre class="screen">
vdt/update/vdt-updater
</pre>

---+++ Get OSG Updates
The only osg package updated in this upgrade will be the osg version package.
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update osg-version</verbatim>
</pre>


---+++ Post Install Configuration

<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>


---+++ Restart VDT Services
This step can be omitted if you are not running any services.
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>
