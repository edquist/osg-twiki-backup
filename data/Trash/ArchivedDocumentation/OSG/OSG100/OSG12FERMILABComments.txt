---++ Summary
We pass correctly on FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB, UC_ITB, LBNL_DSD_ITB, and CIT_ITB_1. 

---++ Known issues
Our automatic probe fails on BNL_ITB_1 with the globus-url-copy for the reason
that our probe long ago made a test subdirectory under one pool account, but
now Keith's certificate is mapped to a different pool account which can't write that
directory.  I tested BNL_ITB_1 manually and all is OK
