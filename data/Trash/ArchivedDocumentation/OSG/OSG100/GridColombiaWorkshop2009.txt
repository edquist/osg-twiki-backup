---++ Background Information
This workshop is the second part in a three phase program supporting the launch of Grid Colombia:

   * Phase I: preparations in advance of the in-person workshop
      * Overview presentation on October 9 (web conference)
      * Student and systems administrator background preparations 
      * Institutional organizational activities
   * Phase II: workshop on scientific computing on Grids and Grid prototype building (this workshop)
   * Phase III: deployment of production facilities across multiple sites in Colombia

Phase II will take place over two weeks and will cover scientific computing on distributed, Grid-based platforms as well as Grid infrastructure building.  The workshops will be held at [[http://www.javeriana.edu.co/puj/english/][Universidad Javeriana]], Bogota, Colombia.  There will be a follow-on workshop focusing on production facilities at all of the participating sites as part of the Grid Colombia overall program of work.

   * October 20-23, 2009: Scientific Computing on Grids: _Introductory Grid Computing Overviews and User Capabilities_
   * October 26-30, 2009: Building Grid Infrastructure: _Towards a National Colombian Science Grid_  
  
Goals of this workshop are to:

   * Introduce grid computing concepts from an end-user's perspective
   * Provide hands-on tutorials for end-user client tools
   * Introduce grid infrastructure building principles
   * Provide hands-on tutorials for compute and storage element installation
