---+!! Data Directories in OSG Storage Areas
%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

The data directories are intended as the spaces for applications to write input and output data files with persistency that must exceed the lifetime of the job which created it. 
   * These directories should be writable by all users.  
   * Users will be able to create sub-directories which are private, as provided by the filesystem. 
   * At least 10 GB of space should be allocated per worker node; some VOs require much larger allocations.

The following different options are possible: 
   * $OSG_DATA: shared directory with read-write access for all users
   * $OSG_SITE_READ: shared directory with read-only access for all users (data may be prestaged by the administrator or using a SE pointing to the same space)
   * $OSG_SITE_WRITE: shared directory with write-only access for all users (data may be staged out by the administrator or using a SE pointing to the same space)

A CE can provide $OSG_DATA, both $OSG_SITE_READ and $OSG_SITE_WRITE, or none of them if it has a local SE specified in $OSG_DEFAULT_SE. 

If a particular hierarchy is not available on your CE, provide the keyword =UNAVAILABLE=.

For additional details please refer to [[LocalStorageRequirements][Local Storage Requirements]].

%IMPORTANT% The $OSG_DATA, $OSG_SITE_READ and $OSG_SITE_WRITE directories must be accessible from the head node as well as each of the worker nodes.
