_Some suggestions before starting your installation._

%EDITTHIS%

The configuration and installation of the OSG Compute Element can be quite overwhelming if you haven't done proper planning.  Except for at the smallest sites, the CE will be only one of your servers; make sure you've read the [[SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]] to understand how this fits into the larger picture.

Before you install the CE, you will need to do the following installs:
   * *New sites only*: Consult [[SiteFabricBestPractices]] for recommendations about the site fabric.
   * Verify your operation system is in the [[OperatingSystems][officially supported list]].
   * You must have a supported batch system (Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE) installed on your CE host machine, or accessible to it.  We provide instructions for installing [[StandaloneCondorInstallation][Condor]] as a batch system if you'd like to use it.
   * The [[PacmanInstall][Pacman]] notes for installation and best practices.
   * You can apply in advance for [[GetGridCertificates][Host and Service Certificates]] needed by your CE host. There are also [[CertScripts][scripts]] that come with the installation that simplify the process somewhat.

---++++ Should I install the OSG CE as root?
*Short answer*: Yes, especially for new sysadmins.

*Long answer*: Most site admins install OSG compute element services as root. Paraphrasing from the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/installation_think.html][VDT site]], if you install as root the VDT's programs can be made available to all the users on your system. Additionally, the VDT will be able to configure and start some of the grid services you might be installing.  Some services can only be run if you are root. _Corollary:_ If you don't install as root, you cannot do these things.  Unless your local policy states otherwise, you will want to install the OSG compute element as root.

---++++ Configuration notes:
The OSG CE configuration step will require you to fill in many values into a configuration file called =config.ini=.  The most comprehensive guide to =config.ini= [[ConfigurationFileHelp][is here]].  We recommend keeping that handy for reference, but there is no need to read it before install.

Before you configure the OSG CE, we recommend the following:
   * Know what grid your site belongs to - the *OSG* (production CEs) or the *OSG-ITB* (dedicated integration/testing for the OSG).
   * Know your CE's *resource* name and *resouce group*.  These are values that you filled out when you registered the site in [[https://oim.grid.iu.edu][OIM]].
   * Determine your site sponsors.  These are the VOs that own the computing resources behind the CE (these must be valid VOs with the exception of "local" for locally-owned resources).  Know approximately what percentage each VO owns.
   * Understand your site's storage setup; this is described in detail in the a separate [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationLocalStorageConfiguration][Local Storage Configuration]] document.
