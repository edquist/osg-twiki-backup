---+!! Setting Up Condor to Work With Globus-WS

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

To set up Condor to work with WS, see these troubleshooting notes related to [[GlobusWsJobManagerNotConfigured][Job Manager (Condor) not configured for web services]]

There is a gram-services configuration file that is not getting updated correctly if your certificates directory is _not_ =/etc/grid-security/certificates=. You will need to manually change the <i>value</i> element in the =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/etc/gram-service/jndi-config.xml=:

<pre class="screen">
&lt;parameter&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;
   x509CertDir
  &lt;name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;
    /usr/local/osg-ce/globus/share/certificates
  &lt;value&gt;
&lt;parameter&gt;
</pre>

If you have already started the Globus container, you will have to re-start it.  If not, you can wait and do it in a later step.
