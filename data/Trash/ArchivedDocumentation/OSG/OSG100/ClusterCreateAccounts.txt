---++ Introduction
Here we describe creation of the needed accounts for the tutorial.  

---++ Account creation
All host in the cluster share the users home directories, therefore user and group IDs must be consistent.
System accounts/groups depend on the OS installation and may differ. Make sure that system (existing) accounts/groups have IDs < 500.
User accounts/groups or accounts/groups used for OSG (including services, like rsv, ganglia, ...) will have IDs >= 500.

To ease consistency accounts and groups are created on one host, e.g. =tg1-ce= and replicated to the others. 
Try to be consistent also in the future when adding new users or services requiring an account. 
   * home directories must be mounted
   * accounts are created with =useradd= utility
   * accounts created:
      * =condor= used by the condor scheduler
      * =gsadmin= (privileged no root user), =gsuser= (a normal interactive user)
      * =grid accounts= as needed, e.g. osg, osgedu, usatlas1, usatlas2, usatlas3, usatlas4
   * Creation of addon files extracting groups/accounts with IDs > 500 (to append to other hosts):
      * =group._addon.tg1= 
      * =passwd._addon.tg1=  
      * =shadow._addon.tg1= (note that shadow is write protected)
   * Push the files to each of the hosts in the cluster, appending them to the corresponding files as appropriate.
   * Check the files manually to verify that they were updated correctly.
