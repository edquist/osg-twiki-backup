---++ Introduction
This is a place where OSG site administrators can share experiences installing OSG software by providing links to their own installation notes/sessions.


---++ Installations
   * *[[http://twiki.mwt2.org/bin/view/Main/DeployingOSG1d0][UC_ATLAS_MWT2]]*: installation (pre-release) OSG 1.0 at UC_ATLAS_MWT2.  A simple CE installation, no managed-fork, no WS-GRAM but otherwise the basic requirements for an OSG site.  (Contact: rwg@hep.uchicago.edu)
   * SBGrid-Harvard-Exp attempted an OSG v1.0 upgrade on Friday 13 June (that should have been a hint...)  Things didn't go well, probably because there was no clear guidance saying to do a fresh install in a new directory.  The site has been down since then.  On Tuesday 24 June we have once again picked up the flag and are pushing forward with an install.  Updates to follow.
   * TTU migrated its complete ITB installation across operating systems and batch schedulers from Rocks4 and PBS to Rocks5 and SGE, keeping only the config.ini file to provide the connection between old installation setup and new.  After editing the config.ini file to reflect the new conditions, tweaking the sudoers file to commen t out the requiretty default, and setting SGE ports in /etc/services on host and worker nodes, the installation came up perfectly.  (Contact: Alan.Sill [at] ttu.edu)
   * Caltech CMS installed ITB 1.1.4 on a Rocks5 CE (64-bit RHEL5) attached to the existing condor batch system and Hadoop storage element.  Details of the installation, which include a lot of site-specific customizations, can be found here:  http://ultralight.caltech.edu/gaewiki/OSG20090618

| These obviously are old installations - and the idea hasn't taken hold very well.  This page is a candidate to deprecate.  | Main.RobGardner | 09 Jul 2009 - 20:19 |
| Use as a holding area for now until we learn how to incorporate site experiences naturally with release documentation. | Main.RobGardner | 10 Jul 2009 - 20:15 |
