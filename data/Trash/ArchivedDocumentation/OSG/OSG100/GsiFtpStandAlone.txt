---+!! *<nop>%SPACEOUT{GSIFTP Server Installation}%*
%TOC%

---++Introduction
The gsiftp package contains components necessary to set up a stand-alone gsiftp server and tools necessary to monitor and report its performance.
A stand-alone gsiftp server might be used under the following circumstances:
   * A simple front-end to a filesystem allowing access over WAN - for example [[Storage/HadoopUnderstanding][HDFS]].
   * Bestman is capable of distributing its workload among several gsiftp servers so if you expect large movements of data into/out of your site, multiple gsiftp servers can be set up.

---+++!!Applicable Versions
This document applies to an install of 
%RED%
*osg-version 1.2.3* 
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher) and 
%RED%
*vdt-version  2.0.0*
%ENDCOLOR%
(or higher).

---+++!!Engineering Considerations
It is recommended that the gsiftp package be installed on its own server if:
   * You are serving the VOs that use storage heavily (CMS, ATLAS, CDF, and D0) and have more than 250 cores
   * Your site will be managing more than 50 TB of disk space

If you are planning to have a Storage Element with !BeStMan and have more
than 1Gbps bandwidth, then you should plan on at least one !GridFTP server
per 4Gbps of available bandwidth (assuming you have 10Gbps interfaces on the
server) if you want to maximize throughput. 

---++Checklist
   1. [[PacmanInstall][pacman]] version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is required
   1. The server must have a fully qualified domain name and a valid [[GetGridCertificates][grid host certificate]] installed in =/etc/grid-security/=
   1. The firewall must allow incoming connections to the gsiftp port (default 2811). Outgoing connections must be allowed from high ports ( typically in range 32769-65535 ). We recommend to consult the [[ComputeElementFirewalls][Firewall Guide]] if you install the !GridFTP server for the first time.
   1. A working GUMS server or a gridmap-file are needed for authorization using grid certificates.

---++Installation Procedure
Login as root and check if pacman version >=%PACMAN_VERSION% is installed:
<pre class="screen">
su root
pacman -version
</pre>
Next create and change to an installation directory. This directory will later be used to get the !GridFTP package  from the %CACHE% cache.
<pre class="screen">
mkdir -p /opt/osg/osg-%OSG_VERSION%-gsiftp/
cd /opt/osg/osg-%OSG_VERSION%-gsiftp/
</pre>
Finally execute pacman to get the !GridFTP package from the %CACHE% cache. Pacman will ask whether you want to trust the cache (=yall=) and whether you want to accept the license (=y=).
<pre class="screen">
pacman -get %CACHE%:GridFTP
</pre>

The install procedure will print out a warning:
<verbatim>
========== IMPORTANT ==========
Most of the software installed by the VDT *will not work* until you install
certificates.  To complete your CA certificate installation, see the notes
in the post-install/README file.
</verbatim>

The information provided in the README is out of date. Please setup the CA certificates in the following way instead:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/bin/vdt-ca-manage setupca --location local -url osg
</pre>
This command will download certificates distributed by the OSG to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= and create a symlink from =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= to that location. [[VDTCAManage][Other options]] are also available.

To reflect the changes update the environment and run the post installation script:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
vdt-post-install
</pre>

You can verify that the version installed is the version you expected by executing =vdt-version=. To see all services available use =vdt-control -list=
<pre class="screen">
vdt-version
vdt-control --list
</pre>

This completes the installation of the !GridFTP server. Move to the next step to configure the server.

---++ Service Configuration

To configure the port range used by the server to transfer files, add following lines to =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh=:

<pre class="screen">
  export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE=32000,64000
  export GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE=32000,64000
</pre>

and also to =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.csh=:

<pre class="screen">
  setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE 32000,64000
  setenv GLOBUS_TCP_SOURCE_RANGE 32000,64000
</pre>

The !GsiFTP Stand-Alone server is configured by the =configure-osg= script located in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/bin/configure-osg= based on the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= configuration file.
The =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/= directory contains two template files =config.ini= and =storage.ini=. First remove the =config.ini= and then rename =storage.ini= to =config.ini=. This procedure will be simplified in the future.
<pre class="screen">
rm $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini
mv $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/storage.ini $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini
</pre>

Then edit the =$VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini= file following instructions that precede each entry.  Here is the list of entries that need to be changed:

<pre class="screen">
[Gridftp]
enabled = %(enable)s
mode = standalone

[Gratia]
enabled = %(enable)s
sitename = <your registered site name>
probes = %(itb-gridftp-gratia)s
</pre>

The =Misc Services= section defines what method of authorization should be used. If your site uses a %RED%gridmap-file%ENDCOLOR% for authorization, please make following changes:
<pre class="screen">
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
authorization_method = gridmap
</pre>

In case your site supports %RED%GUMS%ENDCOLOR%, the fully qualified domain name of the GUMS server must be specified:

<pre class="screen">
[Misc Services]
use_cert_updater = %(enable)s
gums_host = your.gums.server
authorization_method = prima
</pre>

You can verify that your configuration is valid by executing =configure-osg -v=. Finally execute =configure-osg -c= to configure the !GridFTP server:
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>

Hopefully all steps completed successfully and =vdt-control -list= shows the list of available services:
<pre class="screen">
Service                 | Type   | Desired State
------------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl               | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs         | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs        | cron   | enable
gsiftp                  | inetd  | enable
gratia-gridftp-transfer | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron          | cron   | enable
edg-mkgridmap           | cron   | do not enable
</pre>


---++ Service Startup/Shutdown
To start type:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>
and to stop:
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation

On a client host run the globus-url-copy to verify the gsiftp service can successfully transfer a file:
<pre class="screen">
globus-url-copy file:///etc/hosts  gsiftp://osp1.lbl.gov/tmp/hostscopy
</pre>

Verify that the [[GratiaTransferProbe#Sanity_Check][gratia probe is working]].

---++Comments
| Is it mandatory to edit $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/etc/vdt-local-setup.sh. What default values will be used if one skips that step? | Main.RobertEngel | 05 Nov 2009 - 04:03 |
| The section &#34;validation of service operation&#34; needs to be extended. | Main.RobertEngel | 05 Nov 2009 - 04:44 |
| It would be nice, if the section &#34;Service Startup/Shutdown&#34; would explain what the commands are doing. It should be mentioned, that /etc/services is changed, that cronjobs are setup and that these changes are permanent. The convention to call vdt-control --on a service startup will most likely be confused with how unix services are started and stopped. This is of course entirely different.   | Main.RobertEngel | 05 Nov 2009 - 05:11 |
