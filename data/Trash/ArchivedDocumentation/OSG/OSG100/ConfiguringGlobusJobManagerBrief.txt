---++ Globus Configuration

Globus has been pre-configured for this installation and, for installations done by 'root',  all that is needed is to follow the StartingServices section of this install guide.


If you wish to reconfigure it, please review the [[%VDT_DOCS_URL%/config/configure_globus_gatekeeper.html][VDT Globus Configuration Script]] document on using the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper= script. 

Review the configuration files =/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper= and =/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp= (or in =/etc/inetd.conf=) that were created during the pacman installation.

Additionally, =/etc/services= file was updated with the following entries:

<pre class="programlisting">  
 gsiftp                  2811/tcp       # Added by the VDT
 globus-gatekeeper       2119/tcp       # Added by the VDT
</pre>

If the installation was not done as root, these files will exist in =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install= directory.

If you are satisfied with this configuration, restart the xinetd (or inetd) daemon to pick up the configuration changes:

<pre class="screen">
 > <b>/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart</b>
  Stopping xinetd:                       [  OK  ]
  Starting xinetd:                       [  OK  ]
</pre>

To verify that the gatekeeper is running at this point, you should be able to telnet to the public IP address of your site on port 2119 and get a response.%BR% 
<pre>
 > <b>telnet <replaceable>hostname port</replaceable></b> 
</pre>

It should return =Connected to...=. The same should be true of the gsiftp port (2811 by default).


---++ Job Policy and the Batch Queuing System 

The configuration of a production queue manager is beyond the scope of this document. Since there will be periodic validation submitted by DNs in the "mis" VO, it is recommended sites provide at least two levels of priority and assign the lowest priority to user mapped to the "mis" VO.
