---+!! *<nop>OSG 1.2.4 Update Instructions*

%BR%

---++ Release Notes for the OSG 1.2.4 upgrade
This release is a minor upgrade to OSG 1.2 installations and is not critical except for sites using glexec or sites that run jobs that check the lcg-utils version. Release notes for the VDT packages that have been updated can be found [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p10.html][here]].  

---++ Update Instructions
If you have OSG 1.2 services installed you can follow the instructions below to *update* your existing installation.  This method will work for all OSG packages including =ce=, =client=, =wn-client=, and Storage Elements.  This release can be applied to all OSG 1.2 installations, since the vdt-updater will not take any actions if glexec, java, or lcg-utils are not installed.

%NOTE% If you are using packages from OSG 1.0.x or earlier, you must do a brand new installation because OSG 1.2.x uses a different Pacman cache from prior releases. There are installation guides for installing from scratch the various components available in ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome. In addition, for experienced admins, there is a ReleaseDocumentation.QuickInstallGuide available.

%NOTE% *There are changes to the way that !CEMon and Gratia are configured for !CEs in this release, please see the post-installation configuration section before restarting your CE*

---++ Update Instructions from OSG 1.2.x to OSG 1.2.4

---+++ Preliminaries
Go to the directory where you installed your software (root directory of the Pacman installation, <tt>[software location]</tt>) and source the setup script so that the following steps will work correctly.
<pre class="screen">
cd [software location]
source setup.sh
</pre>


---+++ Stop VDT Services
Some packages (e.g. =client= or =wn-client=) may not be running any services, however, doing this step will not cause problems.  

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---+++ Backup your software
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION [BACKUP_LOCATION]
</pre>

---+++ Update the VDT updater script itself
If you do not yet have the updater script, then fetch it:

Note: If you are not sure if you have the updater, look for =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/update/vdt-updater= 

<pre class="screen">
pacman -get http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_200_cache:VDT-Updater
</pre>

If you already have the updater, update it:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre>


---+++ Backup

Backup again since the vdt-updater script will request the location of your backup and verify that the backup is identical to the current contents of the install directory before updating your installation.
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP-LOCATION
</pre> 

---+++ Get VDT Updates
This will update VDT packages specifically.
<pre class="screen">
vdt/update/vdt-updater
</pre>

---+++ Get OSG Updates
The =osg-version= and =osg-config= packages must be updated on all OSG installations:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update osg-version</verbatim>
cp $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini /tmp/config.ini-backup
pacman -update osg-config</verbatim>
cp /tmp/config.ini-backup $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini
</pre>

---+++ Update RSV probes
The RSV probes will also need to be updated as well.  This can be accomplished by running:
<pre class="screen">
${VDT_LOCATION}/osg-rsv/setup/update_from_svn.sh
</pre>

---++++ Post Install Configuration
After you complete the updates of your packages, you will need to run the =vdt-post-install= script in order to complete any post-installation setups needed after your packages have been updated:

<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>

---+++++ Config.ini changes
There are a few changes in the config.ini that you need to be aware of if you are updating an existing CE.  The changes deal with how !CEMon and Gratia are configured.

!CEMon configuration is now done in a separate section of the config.ini.  This is a change from OSG 1.2.3 or before where the !CEMon configuration was handled automatically.  This change allows admins to specify which !CEMon servers their site should report to.  If you are using a config.ini, from OSG 1.2.3 or below, you *must* make sure that at least one job manager is enabled in order for !CEMon to be configured and enabled correctly.  If a job manager is enabled, then the =!CEMon= section does not have to be present in the config.ini for !CEMon to be configured.  However, if you do have a =!CEMon= section, you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting is set to =True=.  If you configuring a new system, then you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting in the CEMon section is set to =True=.

Gratia configuration is now done in a separate section of the config.ini.  This is a change from OSG 1.2.3 or before where the Gratia configuration was handled automatically.  This change allows admins to have their CE report to a local gratia collector as well as the central OSG gratia collector.  If you are using a config.ini, from OSG 1.2.3 or below, you *must* make sure that at least one job manager is enabled in order for Gratia to be configured and enabled correctly.  If a job manager is enabled, then the =Gratia= section does not have to be present in the config.ini for Gratia to be configured.  However, if you do have a =Gratia= section, you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting is set to =True=. If you configuring a new system, then you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting in the Gratia section is set to =True=.


---+++++ Reconfiguration
On a CE, you will also need to reconfigure your system
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -c
</pre>


---+++ Restart VDT Services
This step can be omitted if you are not running any services.  If you are not certain, you can run it since services are disabled by default so the only services that will be started are ones that you have explicitly enabled.
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>
