---++ Introduction

This guide covers the installation of the OSG Compute Element (CE).  The CE is the server software that allows grid jobs to enter and run on your cluster.  If you are unsure of what this does, [[OverviewOfServicesInOSG][read the OSG services overview]].

The install is mostly a straightfoward process; in our experience, most problems occur due to skipping steps in the pre-install checklist and in configuring the software (as the configuration step requires lots of precise information to be filled in).

Generally, this page should take 10 - 60 minutes to follow; it may be that the preparation page takes longer to follow.  If you find your install is taking more than an hour, refer to [[Documentation.SiteAdminResources][the contacts page]] to find out where you can get help.

---++++++!! Applicable Versions
This document focuses on the latest release, %RED% OSG-%OSG_VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%.  However, we attempt to make notes where there are major differences between OSG %OSG_VERSION% and prior versions (both OSG 1.0.x and prior 1.2.y versions).

---++ Before you Install

This document is not standalone.  New sites should *definitely* run through the [[SitePlanning][Site Planning Guide]].  *New CEs* should read through the [[Documentation/Release3.TrashReleaseDocumentationPreparingComputeElement][Preparing the Compute Element]] page.

You *MUST* read the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationPreInstallationChecklistCE][pre-install checklist]]; this covers setting important environment variables critical to the install and the creation of user accounts.

 %IMPORTANT% Common pitfalls:
   * Skipping the pre-installation checklist.
   * If you've just installed the workernode client on your CE, log out and log back in again so that your PATH doesn't become confused. 
   * If you have an existing CE installed and running, you *must* do a complete shutdown and confirm that all processes associated with it have been stopped. Refer to [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationShuttingDownCE][Shutting Down]] for details. Remember you are not shutting down this version, so follow the instructions in the documentation for the previously installed version.
   * Finally, make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 

---++ Install the Compute Element

Now you're ready to start installing the Compute Element.

Create a directory such as =/opt/osg-%VERSION%= and create a sym link =/opt/osg= that points to this directory. Please *do not* install in a directory like /opt or /usr, because the installation will create many subdirectories in its top-level directory.  From here forward this directory is known as the _$VDT_LOCATION_; after you setup the OSG environment, this variable will be in your environment.

The installation described here is done as root even though services will not necessarily run as root.

As described in the preparation document, you should [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationPacmanInstall][already have pacman installed]] and the =pacman= command in your environment.  Run the following to install the CE software:

<pre class="screen">pacman -get %CACHE%:ce</pre>

Pacman will ask you if you trust of the caches that deliver the software.  %BR% Please answer *y* (yes) so that the software can be retrieved.  See the [[Trash.ReleaseDocumentationPacmanBestPractices][Pacman section]] of this guide if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message.

%NOTE% This will take between 5 and 30 minutes to complete, depending upon the system and network connection. During this time you may open a second terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log= file.

After the initial question about caches, you should not be asked any other questions during the installation process. The installation should complete with the following message:
<pre>Downloading [vo-package-6.tar.gz] from [http://software.grid.iu.edu/osg-1.2/tarballs]...  
Untarring [vo-package-6.tar.gz]...  
Existing /usr/local/vdt-1.10.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf moved to /usr/local/vdt-1.10.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf.orig 
Merge it manually with the new /usr/local/vdt-1.10.0/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf if you had a special edg-mkgridmap.conf <p>Pacman Installation of OSG-%VERSION% Complete </p></pre>
%STARTOSG12% 
In the latest release the install may complete with the following message if you set OLD_VDT_LOCATION to preserve previous configuration.
<pre>
All prerequisite checks are satisfied.
Your CA certificates have been setup automatically using information from
OLD_VDT_LOCATION.  Verify the link at VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA
                                                                              
Pacman Installation of OSG-%VERSION% Complete
 
</pre>
%ENDOSG12%

*WARNING*: Do not continue if the pacman command ended in an error.

---++ Setup the OSG environment

You should now source the OSG environment. Change your directory to _$VDT_LOCATION_ (the location where you installed the software) and run,

<pre class="screen"> source setup.sh</pre>
or
<pre class="screen"> source setup.csh</pre>
as appropriate for your shell.

If the setup.sh or setup.csh files do not exist, your install in the previous section failed; see =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log= for more information.  Do not proceed in this case.

---++ Install job managers

You need to install an extra package to interface with your existing Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE installation.

%NOTE% The PBS and Condor batch systems require special consideration:
   * For PBS, make sure your PBS binaries (qsub, qstat, qdel) are in the $PATH prior to installation. Otherwise the install will fail silently with error reported to =vdt-install.log= and jobmanager-pbs will not be created.  If this is done, do a =<userinput>pacman -remove %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup</userinput>=, insert the binaries into your PATH and install again.
   * For Condor, have the following environment variables set (otherwise the package will install a complete version of Condor):
      * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION==: the location of your Condor installation (e.g. =/opt/condor=). The Condor =bin/=, =sbin/=, =etc/=, =lib/= ... directories should be directly under this location. 
      * ==VDTSETUP_CONDOR_CONFIG==: The location of your Condor configuration file. Defaults to =${VDTSETUP_CONDOR_LOCATION}/etc/condor_config.

After you *%BLUE% ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path,%ENDCOLOR%*, run the command below relevant to your batch system:

<pre class="screen">pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-Condor-Setup 
pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-PBS-Setup
pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-LSF-Setup  
pacman -get %CACHE%:Globus-SGE-Setup </pre>

These packages will install hooks for Globus pre-WS, Globus web-services (WS), and Gratia accounting probes.

%NOTE%  Globus-Condor-Setup *only* - The $VDT_LOCATION/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/condor.pm will by default insert a requirement that all jobs run on nodes of the same architecture as the gatekeeper. i.e. if your gatekeeper is x86_64 architecture, your jobs will only run there. If your gatekeeper is x86 (i686 "INTEL"), your jobs would only run there. You have to comment out the line in condor.pm that looks like this to override this feature:
<pre>#    $requirements .= " && Arch == \"" . $description->condor_arch() . "\" "; </pre>

---++ Post-Install
%STARTOSG12% OSG 1.2 has introduced a new post-install step that might confuse experienced admins:
<pre class="screen">vdt-post-install</pre>
This must be done after all Pacman installations have finished.
<!--2. Run the =vdt-ca-manage= command to download and install CA certificates - further instructions for this are in the "Install the CA Certificate Updater" section.-->
%ENDOSG12%

The VDT install will include a *README* file located in =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= file.  The OSG install guides will cover all the steps mentioned there; there is no need to follow it right now.
