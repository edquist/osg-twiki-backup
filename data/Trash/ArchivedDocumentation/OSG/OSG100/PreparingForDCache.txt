---++ Introduction
dCache is a disk-caching system jointly developed by Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab). Although it was initially developed to provide disk caching for tertiary storage, dCache makes an excellent grid Storage Element (SE) &ndash; even without tape backend &ndash; because it has a [[https://srm.fnal.gov/twiki/bin/view/SrmProject/WebHome][Storage Resource Manager]] interface and  supports multiple transfer protocols:  gridftp, xrootd, dcap, and http. dCache also provides a single name space across the entire pool of disk servers, making it look like a single file system to the users. It simplifies administration by providing mechanisms for internal clean-up and load balancing, which alows efficient use of storage space and handling of users' requests.

There is a [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/dcache.html][VDT-based installation of dCache]].

See [[Documentation/StorageDcacheOverview][Overview of dCache for OSG]] for information.

---++ Integration with the information system
Integration of the SE with the central information systems takes place during the Compute Element installation/configuration. See the topic [[ReleaseDocumentation/GenericInformationProviders][Generic Information Providers]]  The SE does not collect or publish information independently.
