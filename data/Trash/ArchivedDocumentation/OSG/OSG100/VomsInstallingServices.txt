---++ Installation location
Wherever you like.  Shown below as a directory under =/usr/local/osg=.  Here we'll call it =voms=. Then set the VDT_LOCATION variable to that directory.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>VDT_LOCATION=/usr/local/osg</b>
# <b>mkdir voms</b>
# <b>export VDT_LOCATION=/usr/local/osg/voms</b>
</pre>

---++ Installation Cache
<pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION
# pacman -get  %CACHE%:voms
</pre>
%OSG12% <pre class="screen">
# cd $VDT_LOCATION
# pacman -get  %CACHE%:voms
# source setup.sh
# vdt-post-install
</pre>

---++ Installation output/questions
%OSG12% In this release, the only questions that may appear are related to 'trusted caches' and 'unrecognized platforms' depending on your host.  %BR%%BR%The _pacman_ variables that were used to pre-answer questions are now ignored. <pre class="screen">
Test of a pre/verbatim in the OSG12 variable
</pre>

Some of the questions related to 'trusted caches' and 'unrecognized platforms' may not appear depending on your host and any _pacman_ variables already set in your environment.

VDT 1.10.1 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.10.1

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n]  <b>y</b>

Do you want to run a cron job that will update the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Do you want to update the CA certification revocation lists (CRLs) automatically? <b>y</b>

--------  2 -------------

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically
Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.
<b>y</b>

---------  3  ------------
If you would like, we can configure VOMS to start automatically
at boot time.

Configuring the VOMS daemon requires
  - changes to /etc/init.d (or /etc/rc.d/init.d)
  - starting up a MySQL server
  - starting up an Apache and Tomcat server

Would you like to enable the VOMS server to run automatically?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically
Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.
<b>y</b>

---------  4  ------------

Do you want to automatically update your CA certificates? If so,
we will check for updates once a day via cron.

Do you want to automatically update your CA Certificates? [y/n]  <b>y</b>

---------  5  ------------

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.0/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b>l</b>

---++ Verify the  installation completed successfully
To verify  the VOMS installation was successful, there should be a setup.(c)sh in the VDT_LOCATION.  Source it.

<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source setup.sh</b>
</pre>

%IMPORTANT% This does not necessarily indicate that everything was installed and configured successfully.  It just verifies that the pacman installation of VOMS completed successfully.  There is a lot of other "magic" that occurs during the process that should be validated. We'll take you through that process.

---++ Starting VOMS
In order to enable VOMS you have to perform the following action:
<pre class="screen">
# <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
# <b>source setup.sh</b>
# <b>vdt-control --on</b>
enabling cron service fetch-crl... ok
enabling cron service vdt-rotate-logs... ok
enabling cron service vdt-update-certs... ok
enabling init service mysql... ok
enabling init service apache... ok
enabling init service tomcat-55... ok
enabling init service voms... o
