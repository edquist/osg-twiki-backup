%TOC%

---++ Rules for topics and templates
   * All topics have a *bold heading* at Level 1 (=---+*<nop>Title*=) and first letters of words are capitalized (eg. Rules For Formatting Documents).
   * The level one heading is taken as its twiki topic name, separated into words (e.g., !MyTopic becomes My Topic). Choose the twiki name carefully!
   * All sections (level two and below) have the first word capitalized, the rest lower case.  Eg: =---++ Details on the installation= (except for proper nouns)
   * Exclude from the TOC all sections level three and below (=---+++=, =---++++=, etc.).  To accomplish this,  add =!!= before the title, e.g., =---+++ !!Title=.
   * Include COMPLETE, RESPONSIBLE, and REVIEW directives at the bottom. 
   * [[ExampleMainTopic]] for a main topic *not likely* to be used with =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= so as to be included in other topics.
   * [[ExampleTopicInclude]] for a topic likely to included in other topics, so =STARTINCLUDE/STOPINCLUDE= and =EDITTHIS= directives are used.
   * [[ExampleCompositeDocument]] what a composite document of includes should look like.
   * Wherever possible [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TextFormattingRules][TWiki editing]] should be used rather than raw HTML.
   * Avoid nested INCLUDES.
   * Here is the WebTopicEditTemplate for newly created pages in this twiki, which are assumed to be included in other topics.
   * For content that is OSG 1.2 specific, use the *STARTOSG12* variable to before the content and *ENDOSG12* after the content.  E.g. =%<nop>STARTOSG12% OSG 1.2 content %<nop>ENDOSG12%=.  You need to place a space between the =%<nop>STARTOSG12%= tag and the content.

---++ Variables
See WebPreferences for settings of the following variables.

   * OSG release variable: *%<nop>OSG_VERSION%* = %OSG_VERSION%
   * ITB release variable: *%<nop>ITB_VERSION%* = %ITB_VERSION%
   * VDT release variable: *%<nop>VDT_VERSION%* = %VDT_VERSION%
   * Release variable, according to cache (ITB or OSG): *%<nop>VERSION%* = %VERSION%
   * VDT cache variable: *%<nop>VDT_CACHE%* = %VDT_CACHE%
   * ITB/OSG cache/grid variable: *%<nop>CACHE%* = %CACHE%
      * Use the  *%<nop>CACHE%* variable as a generic reference for either "ITB" or "OSG" *caches*, *grids*, etc.  It automatically expands to "ITB" if its in the Integration web, or to "OSG" if its in the production release documentation web.
   * Refer to the cache/version combination that you're using, e.g, %CACHE% %VERSION%, with a space in between, as %BR% %BLUE% %<nop>CACHE% %<nop>VERSION% %ENDCOLOR%
   * Full URL to base of VDT Documentation for current release *%<nop>VDT_DOCS_URL%*: %VDT_DOCS_URL%
   * Full URL to VDT Cache for this release: *%<nop>VDT_CACHE_URL%*: %VDT_CACHE_URL%
   * Full URL to OSG Cache (ITB or Production) for this release *%<nop>OSG_CACHE_URL%*: %OSG_CACHE_URL%
   * Pacman version: *%<nop>PACMAN_VERSION%*: %PACMAN_VERSION%

---++ Reviewing tools

   * See ReviewStatus.

---++ Comments
A comment section (like the one below) should be added at the bottom of each page using a code like:
<pre>
---++ *Comments*
%<nop>COMMENT{type="tableappend"}%
</pre>

---++ !WebLeftBar
