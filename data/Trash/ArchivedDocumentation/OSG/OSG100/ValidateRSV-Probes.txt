---++ Introduction

Detailed introduction about the changes to existing probes, and the new probes available in this new version of !RSV, are <a href="#intro"><strong>provided below the testing instructions</strong></a>.

---++ Instructions for validating !RSV probes
   * If you've installed the complete !OSG CE or !RSV package as outlined in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/ITB090/ValidateRSV-Infrastructure][Validating RSV Infrastructure]], then <u>you can skip step 1 in the instructions page linked below</u>, and use the probes installed in =$VDT_LOCATION/osg-rsv/bin/probes= to test them.
   * <p>Follow the [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/rsv-testing.html#probes-only][instructions on the RSV web site for testing the probes]]. 
   * <p> If you find any errors in the probes, or other issues, then please execute the corresponding probe script with an additional switch =--verbose=. For example, =perl gram-authentication-probe -u somehost.foo.edu --verbose=

   * Additional Hints:
      * If you're testing individual probes, then try to make sense out of the probe name as most of them are self explanatory; 
         * If in doubt, type perl =./some-name-probe -h= on the command line, and you'll get a complete description of the probe along with its command line options
         * Check if the tests actually work; are you seeing meaningful success/failure results being displayed in the =detailsData= line of the probe output?
   * If these tests succeed, make %Y% entry in the validation table for your site.
   * If these tests are not clear, please contact [[http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/documentation/rsv-contact-info.html][the RSV developers]] and cc osg-int@opensciencegrid.org.


<a name="intro"></a>
---++ Revisiting Introduction of Probe set version 2
<p> There are several new probes in this new version:
---+++ New CE probes
   * <tt>vdt-version-probe</tt> - self explanatory
   * <tt>vo-supported-probe</tt> - self explanatory
   * <tt>gums-authorization-validator-probe</tt> - For CEs using GUMS, this probe runs a gums client script on CE, which in turn connects to your GUMS server, and does appropriate tests (are all required mappings in place, etc).

---+++ New !SRM SE probes
   * <tt>srm-ping-probe</tt> - Does simple !SRM ping
   * <tt>srmcp-srm-probe</tt> - Does !SRM read/write test if provided with an !SRM directory to write to, using <tt>--srm-destination-dir</tt> parameter.

---+++ Existing probes that have been modified heavily
   * <tt>classad-valid-probe</tt> - For CEs running Condor, and uploading records to !ReSS, this probe connects to !ReSS collector, and tests if your resource has all valid classads. Uses newer testing method, expected to produce more accurate results.
   * <tt>cacert-crl-expiry-probe</tt> - The <tt>org.osg.certificates.cacert-expiry</tt> metric uses a completely new method to test for expired CAcerts -- it just looks for the CAcert package version now.
   * <tt>gridftp-simple-probe</tt> - Allows a gridftp destination directory and a delay (between write and read-back) to be specified.
   * <tt>osg-directories-probe</tt> - the <tt>org.osg.general.osg-directories-CE-permissions</tt> metric in this probe does a more accurate check now by allowing for required/non-required OSG directories first before checking for their permissions.
