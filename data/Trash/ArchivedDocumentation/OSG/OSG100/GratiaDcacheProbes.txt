The probes report storage related information to the central Gratia collector. There are two types of probes:
    * The transfer probe reports to Gratia the details of each file transfer into or out of a dCache file server. 
    * The storage probe is responsible for reporting storage capacity and storage usage to the central Gratia repository. The information reported is:
       * The storage capacity and amount used for each dCache pool.
       * The storage capacity and amount used for each SRM Space reservation.
