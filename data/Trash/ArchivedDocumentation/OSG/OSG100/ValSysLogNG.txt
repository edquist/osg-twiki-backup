---++ Syslog-ng checks

Syslog-ng comes preconfigured to forward the following logfiles to a central collection host at the GOC:

   * accounting.log
   * apache error_log
   * apache access_log
   * edg_mkgridmap.log
   * gridftp_auth.log
   * gridftp.log
   * globus_gatekeeper.log
   * container.log
   * container_real.log
 
The selection of logs and collector destinations are controlled by a configuration file, =$VDT_LOCATION/syslog-ng/etc/syslog-ng.conf=.  The GOC will maintain privileged access to the collection service and verify that the logs are being collected. In addition, there is a log for syslog-ng that registers the connection to the service.  By default that log is =/tmp/syslog-ng.log=.  To locally check the service:

   * verify syslog-ng is running: =ps aux | grep syslog-ng=
   * verify connection and operation:  =cat /tmp/syslog-ng.log=
