The purpose of this document is to describe how to handle !BeStMan (full-mode or gateway) installation on Compute Element (CE) node. Please refer to [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman][BeStMan full-mode Installation Guide]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGetway][BeStMan-gateway Installation Guide]] for more details.

---++ Configuration Decisions
It could be not a very wise idea to install !BeStMan on heavily used CE node but if you need to do that you should keep in mind that you will need to use non-standard ports for !BeStMan to avoid conflict with apache/tomcat servers as well as use !GridFTP server and authorization infrastructure that are already installed on CE node.   

The following questions should be answered before you can proceed with installation and  configuration:

Q. _What authorization mechanism do you prefer?_ 
 
You have to decide if you want to use grid-map-file or !GUMS server for users’ 
authentication and authorization. Most logically will be to select the same approach that is already being used on CE (e.g for gratia probes)
 
Q. _Do you need to support space tokens for !BeStMan-gatewy?_  

!BeStMan-gateway supports predefined, static space tokens that should be 
included in configuration. It doesn't keep trace or enforce static space tokens.  If 
you want partition your storage space and have a “designated” space for some 
VOs or users you can choose to use space tokens. You will have to decide the 
names and descriptions of the tokens as well as the size of the area.  

Q. _Do you want to enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes?_

If you want to report all the transfers in and out of your storage you would need to install or enable Gratia gridftp-transfer probes. More details should be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/WebHome  Gratia Home Page]]. The reported information will include the source and destination of transfer, certificate subject of transfer initiator, size and status of the transferred file.  

---++ Installing !BeStMan
---+++ Create an installation directory
Create a directory, e.g.  /opt/%CACHE%-bestman. Make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, python, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable. 
We will refer to this directory as _&lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;_. 

---+++ Downloading !BeStMan-gateway 
The installation described here is done as root even though services does not  run as root:


<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
pacman -get %CACHE%:Bestman 
</pre>

 %ICON{"warning"}%A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed. Please answer to these questions the following way:

<pre class="screen">
      Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
l
...
...
Would you like to enable Globus GridFTP daemon to run automatically?

Possible answers:
    y: Yes, I want the service to run automatically (once enabled)
    n: No, I do NOT want the service to run automatically

Note: Services are enabled with vdt-control; see 'post-install/README'.

n
...
Do you want edg-mkgridmap daemon to be run automatically? If so, we
will run it four times a day via cron.

edg-mkgridmap will update your gridmap file by communicating with
VOMS servers. This will only be useful if you are part of a Virtual
Organization (VO) or you allow users from VOs.

Do you want edg-mkgridmap daemon to be run via cron? [y/n] n
</pre>

You may want to answer y (yes) to all other questions that would be asked during the installation.

</pre>
See the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/PacmanBestPractices][Pacman]] guide if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message. 



To check what services have been installed on your node you can do:

<pre class="screen"> 
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
 vdt-control --list

Service            | Type   | Desired State
-------------------+--------+--------------
fetch-crl          | cron   | enable
vdt-rotate-logs    | cron   | enable
vdt-update-certs   | cron   | enable
gsiftp             | inetd  | do not enable
gratia-gridftp-tran| cron   | do not enable
bestman            | init   | enable
edg-mkgridmap      | cron   | do not enable
gums-host-cron     | cron   | do not enable
</pre>

 %ICON{"warning"}% A  Follow the instructions provided in _$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README_ to configure CA package updates.


---++ Configuring !BeStMan

Keep in mind that you have to use ports different from 8080 and 8443 and same authorization mechanism that is in use on that CE node.
If you are installing !BeStMan-full mode follow [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Bestman#Configuration][these instructions]]
If you are installing !BeStMan-gateway follow [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BestmanGateway#Configuring_BeStMan_gateway][these instructions]]

---++ Configuring Gratia !GridFTP Transfer Probe
If you want to enable Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe you will need to do the To configure Gratia !GridFTP transfer probe do the following:
<pre class="screen">
cd &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt;
. setup.sh
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia  \
 --probe gridftp-transfer \
 --report-to &lt;gratia_host:gratia_port&gt; \
 --probe-cron --site-name &lt;SiteName&gt;
</pre>

Where _gratia_host_ is FQDN of Gratia collector, _gratia_port_ is Gratia Collector port and  _SiteName_ is your site name.

If you want to do additional changes in configuration, eg change location of gridftp logs or name of the Grid (default is OSG) you can edit _ProbConfig_ file  located in
_$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/probe/gridftp-transfer_ directory.

You will need to modify the following parameters in probe configuartion file.
   1. Location of !GridFTP logs
<pre class="screen">
   UserVOMapFile="&lt;CE_VDT_LOCATION&gt;/monitoring/osg-user-vo-map.txt"
</pre>   

   1. Location of _osg-vo-map.txt_ file 
<pre class="screen">
    GridftpLogDir="&lt;CE_VDT_LOCATION&gt;/globus/var/log"
</pre>

---++ Start/Stop !BeStMan
You have to be root to start/stop each service. 
   1. Start !BeStMan  and !Gratia transfer probe.Login on CE node, then:<pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –on 
</pre>
   1. Stop !BeStMan and !Gratia transfer probe.Login on CE node, then:<pre class="screen">cd  &lt;VDT_LOCATION&gt; 
. setup.sh 
vdt-control –off
</pre>
