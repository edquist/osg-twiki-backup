---++ Introduction
A list of issues in this current release that have been identified.

---++ OSG 1.2.5
---+++ Xrootd 
cnsd log file is not created on startup and  the information is continuing to be dumped into xrootd log file after it was rotated. So, the space utilization on the data server will grow fairly quickly.

The workaround to correct this while a bugfix is implemented is to:
   1 stop xrootd daemons on data server <pre class="screen">
cd <VDT_LOCATION>
. setup.sh
vdt-control -off xrootd
</pre>
   1 Modify configuration file <pre class="screen">
cd $VDT_LOCATION/xrootd/etc
</pre>

   1 edit xrootd.cfg and replace <pre class="screen">
ofs.notify create closew mkdir | ${xrootdlocation}/bin/XrdCnsd -d -l ${xrootdlocation}/var/logs/cnsd.log root://$(xrdr):2094
</pre> with <pre class="screen">
ofs.notify create closew mkdir | ${xrootdlocation}/bin/XrdCnsd -d  root://$(xrdr):2094
</pre>

   1 Restart xrootd deamons <pre class="screen">
vdt-control -on
</pre>

---++ OSG 1.2.4
---+++ RSV gums probe
The =org.osg.gums.authorization-status= probe may return an error if an user proxy is being used for rsv.  There is currently no workaround aside from either using a service certificate for rsv or disabling the gums probe.

---+++ SE configuration issues
%NOTE% The non-ce configuration features in configure-osg are still not fully stable, features and options will change between now and the OSG 1.2.5 release.

The =configure-osg= script does has a few issues new configuring bestman configurations.  The following issues exist when configuring SE software using configure-osg:

   * Bestman full mode configurations aren't currently supported.  The Bestman full mode can't be selected currently.
   * Xrootd-fs configuration requires the directory being used as the mount point to exist, the configure_xrootdfs script can create this directory so this check is unncessarily restrictive.
   * Xrootd cache and storage paths are required to be present although the configure scripts will create the directories so this check is also unnecessarily restrictive.
   * The comments for the cache/storage settings in the bestman are switched (this will be corrected in the osg 1.2.5 release).

The issues will be corrected in the OSG 1.2.7 release.
