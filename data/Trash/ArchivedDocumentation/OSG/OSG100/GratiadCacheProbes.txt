---++ Overview

The probes report storage related information to the central Gratia collector. The probes are installed on their correct nodes by the VDT install scripts during an initial dCache installation or upgrade.

There are two types of probes:

   * The transfer probe reports to Gratia the details of each file transfer into or out of a dCache file server. 

The probe gets this information from the dCache "billing" database and should run on the dcache node on which the dCache http domain is running. For performance reasons, sites with large dCache billing databases are advised to alter the "billinginfo" table by adding an index on the pair of columns (datestamp, transaction) and to alter the "doorinfo" table by adding an index on the (transaction) column. This should speed up the search for newly added records.

   * The storage probe is responsible for reporting storage capacity and storage usage to the central Gratia repository. The information reported is:
          o The storage capacity and amount used for each dCache pool.
          o The storage capacity and amount used for each SRM Space reservation.

It gets the pool information from the dCache admin server. It gets the SRM information from the SRM tables in the SRM "srmdcache" database. Therefore it should run on the dCache node on which srm is running.
