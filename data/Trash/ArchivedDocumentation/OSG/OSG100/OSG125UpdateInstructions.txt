---+!! *<nop>OSG 1.2.5 Update Instructions*

%BR%

---++ Release Notes for the OSG 1.2.5 upgrade
This release is a minor upgrade to OSG 1.2 installations and is not critical except for sites in the ATLAS VO which are using !BeStMan, Xrootd, or !XrootdFS. Release notes for the VDT packages that have been updated can be found [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/release-p12.html][here]].  The only components updated in this release are !BeStMan, Xrootd, and !XrootdFS. Compute Element or other non-SE installations do not need to be updated.

---++ Update Instructions
If you have OSG 1.2 services installed, you can follow the instructions below to *update* your existing installation.  This method will work for all OSG packages including =ce=, =client=, =wn-client=, and Storage Elements.  This release can be applied to all OSG 1.2 installations, since the vdt-updater will not take any actions if packages do not need to be updated.

%NOTE% If you are using packages from OSG 1.0.x or earlier, you must do a brand new installation because OSG 1.2.x uses a different Pacman cache from prior releases. There are installation guides for installing from scratch the various components available in [[ReleaseDocumentation.WebHome][the documentation home]]. In addition, for experienced admins, there is a [[ReleaseDocumentation.QuickInstallGuide][quick-install guide]] available.

%NOTE% *There are changes to the way that !CEMon, Gratia are configured for !CEs in OSG 1.2.4.  Please see the [[#PostInstallConfiguration][post-installation configuration section]] before restarting your CE if you are upgrading from OSG 1.2.3 or below*

---++ Update Instructions from OSG 1.2.x to OSG 1.2.5

---++++ Preliminaries
Go to the directory where you installed your software (root directory of the Pacman installation, =VDT_LOCATION=) and source the setup script so that the following steps will work correctly.
<pre class="screen">
cd VDT_LOCATION
source setup.sh
</pre>

On CEs, make sure that your batch system binaries are in your PATH, especially if you are running SGE.

---++++ Stop VDT Services
Some packages (e.g. =client= or =wn-client=) may not be running any services, however, doing this step will not cause problems.  

<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --off
</pre>

---++++ Backup your software
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP_LOCATION
</pre>

---++++ Update the VDT updater script itself

Get the latest version of the vdt-updater script:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update VDT-Updater
</pre>

Note: If you do not yet have the updater script (look for =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/sbin/vdt-updater=), then fetch it with this command:
<pre class="screen">pacman -get %VDT_CACHE_URL%:VDT-Updater</pre>


---++++ Backup

Backup again since the vdt-updater script will request the location of your backup and verify that the backup is identical to the current contents of the install directory before updating your installation.
<pre class="screen">
cp -a $VDT_LOCATION BACKUP_LOCATION
</pre> 

---++++ Get VDT Updates
This will update VDT packages specifically:
<pre class="screen">
vdt/update/vdt-updater
</pre>

After updating, re-source the setup.sh file to load any changes in the environment:
<pre class="screen">
source setup.sh
</pre>

---++++ Get OSG Updates
The =osg-version= and =osg-config= packages must be updated on all OSG installations:
<pre class="screen">
pacman -update osg-version</verbatim>
cp $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini /tmp/config.ini-backup
pacman -update osg-config</verbatim>
cp /tmp/config.ini-backup $VDT_LOCATION/osg/etc/config.ini
</pre>


---+++ Update RSV probes
The RSV probes will also need to be updated as well.  This can be accomplished by running:
<pre class="screen">
${VDT_LOCATION}/osg-rsv/setup/update_from_svn.sh
</pre>

#PostInstallConfiguration
---++++  Post Install Configuration 
After you complete the updates of your packages, you will need to run the =vdt-post-install= script in order to complete any post-installation setups needed after your packages have been updated:

<pre class="screen">
vdt-post-install
</pre>

---+++++ Config.ini changes
There are a few changes in the config.ini that you need to be aware of if you are updating an existing CE.  The changes deal with how !CEMon and Gratia are configured.

!CEMon configuration is now done in a separate section of the config.ini.  This is a change from OSG 1.2.3 or earlier where the !CEMon configuration was handled automatically.  This change allows admins to specify which !CEMon servers their site should report to.  If you are using a config.ini, from OSG 1.2.3 or earlier, you *must* make sure that at least one job manager is enabled in order for !CEMon to be configured and enabled correctly.  If a job manager is enabled, then the =CEMon= section does not have to be present in the config.ini for !CEMon to be configured.  However, if you do have a =CEMon= section, you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting is set to =True=.  If you are configuring a new system, then you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting in the CEMon section is set to =True=.

Gratia configuration is now done in a separate section of the config.ini.  This is a change from OSG 1.2.3 or earlier where the Gratia configuration was handled automatically.  This change allows admins to have their CE report to a local gratia collector as well as the central OSG gratia collector.  If you are using a config.ini, from OSG 1.2.3 or earlier, you *must* make sure that at least one job manager is enabled in order for Gratia to be configured and enabled correctly.  If a job manager is enabled, then the =Gratia= section does not have to be present in the config.ini for Gratia to be configured.  However, if you do have a =Gratia= section, you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting is set to =True=. If you are configuring a new system, then you *must* make sure that the =enabled= setting in the Gratia section is set to =True=.


---+++++ Reconfiguration
On a CE, you will also need to reconfigure your system
<pre class="screen">
configure-osg -v
configure-osg -c
</pre>

On a SE, you may need to rerun =configure_xrootd= before you start your services again. 


---++++ Restart VDT Services
This step can be omitted if you are not running any services.  If you are not certain, you can run it since services are disabled by default so the only services that will be started are ones that you have explicitly enabled.
<pre class="screen">
vdt-control --on
</pre>
