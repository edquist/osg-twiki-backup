Several steps have to be done to actually enable your VOMRS installation to begin accepting membership, synchronizing with voms, sending notifications.

The following sub-sections will reference the default <i>VDT</i> in the text and examples.  When enabling your 'real' VO, the same steps are required and, where different, it will be noted.


---++ Establishing a first member
A first member of a VO is a designated as a VOAdmin for the VOMRS VO created.  This person has administrative capability within VOMRS that the normal VO member will not have. Only the first member of the VO could be added the way described below.  

%NOTE%

There are 2 options for adding a first member to a  VO:

<ol>
     <li>Individual's certificate file is available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vomrs/sbin/add_admin --vo <em>VO</em>  --file <em>usercert.pem</em> 
          --org <em>Fermilab</em> --firstname <em>Name</em> --lastname <em>Last Name</em> 
          --phone <em>Phone</em> </b>
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Individual's certificate file is <u>not</u> available:
<pre class="screen">
&gt; <b>$VDT_LOCATION/vomrs/sbin/add_admin --vo <em>VO</em> --nousercert  
         --dn "<em>USER DN</em>"  --ca "<em>USER CA</em>" --org <em>Fermilab</em> 
         --firstname <em>Name</em> --lastname <em>Last Name</em> 
         --phone <em>Phone</em></b>
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


---++ Verifying you are a VOAdmin
If you've established yourself with the <i>VOAdmin</i> role, you can now go back the VOMRS web ui in a browser with your certificate and from the main menu:
   1. You can see that there are now many expandable menu items. In order to expend menu click on <i>[+]</i>, to collapse click on <i>[-]</i>
   1. Click on  <i>Members</i> in order to see all members of the vo , select <i>Search</i>. You should see just one entry - yours.
   1. Please refer to [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/vomrs1_3/wwhelp/wwhimpl/java/html/wwhelp.htm][VOMRS User Guide]] for further information
