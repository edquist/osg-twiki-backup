---++ *Comments*
| Jeff Porter comment above needs fixing. | Main.RobGardner | 09 Jul 2009 - 17:19 |
| The sudo section needs a comment, that 'daemon' might not be the default unix accont used by globus to run the container. On many resources the 'globus' account is being used instead. | Main.RobertEngel | 10 Jul 2009 - 17:30 |
| If you have a server certificate but it is expired "vdt-control --on" will start your service but they will not work. Check the gatekeeper log file if you cannot authenticate. | Main.MarcoMambelli | 10 Jul 2009 - 19:15 |
| If the OLD_VDT_LOCATION is set there is no need to run the cert updater by hand, the certs will be handled same way as they were in the old install. I am not sure whether that happens always, but always for me.<br />Also seems to me that the Enabling Full Privilege Authentication is done automatically based on config.ini and the files are placed where they need to be - nothing to be done for it these days.<br /> | Main.IwonaSakrejda | 23 Jul 2009 - 20:54 |
