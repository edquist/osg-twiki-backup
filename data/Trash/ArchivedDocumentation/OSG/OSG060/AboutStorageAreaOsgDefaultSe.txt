---+ About the OSG_DEFAULT_SE Storage Area
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%
The OSG_DEFAULT_SE variable represents a Storage Element closely related to the CE, accessible from within the cluster (visible to worker nodes) only via SE access methods such as Gridftp or SRM. If OSG_DEFAULT_SE is accessible from outside, it is the preferred SE for the CE and should be used when doing a two- or more step copy of input datasets to the CE. For example, doing a 3rd-party transfer to OSG_DEFAULT_SE, then copying to OSG_WN_TMP using a client program.

In a simple cluster, OSG_DEFAULT_SE could be an SE visible from both inside and outside, and serving an internally shared space like OSG_DATA. This would allow I/O via grid tools in sites that had no shared space,

---+++ Typical uses of OSG_DEFAULT_SE
   * Staging in of large input files (e.g. datasets)
   * Staging out of large output files (e.g. datasets)

---+++ Notes
None. 
<!--
  1. This is not guaranteed. To describe better the SE connected to CE storages like DATA, SITE_READ, SITE_WRITE a better mechanism will have to be defined. The GLUE CE-SE binding schema could be a starting point.
