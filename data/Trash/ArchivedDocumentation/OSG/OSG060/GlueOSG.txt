---++Introduction
An Information service facilitates the usability of a resource by publishing status information about the resource.

The Information Service can be characterized by the data that it is publishing (set of attributes), the way  this data is organized (information schema), the system used to gather the information (information provider) and the system used to make the information available (information publisher or server).

In order to use a resource a user has to be able to access all the information he needs, using a known schema (to know where to look for it) and a known information server.

An LCG resource broker, in order to submit jobs to a CE, needs to access its information, organized according the [[#GLUE][GLUE]] schema and published through a [[#BDII][BDII]]

The OSG publishes information using GLUE v1.2 schema and uses Generic Information Provider (GIP) as its information provider. The GIP publishes information to a local CEMon server. The information then gets published to a OSG wide BDII server (in ldif format) as well as to the OSG Resource Selection Service (ReSS) (in class-ad format)

The discussion about information system and information schema is important for several reasons including defining a way to describe resources within OSG and interoperate with other Grids.

---++GLUE

The GLUE (Grid Laboratory Uniform Environment) information model is an information schema initially developed in 2002 to foster interoperation between Grids. GLUE itself is a collection of attributes with a name, multiplicity, type and description of the content. There are multiple equivalent deployments of GLUE. These are a UML schema, X.500 (LDAP) schema, a relational schema and an XML representation.
Although the information providers should not matter for the final data published, a loose specification of the syntax and semantic of some attributes in GLUE 1.1 caused discrepancies among different information providers.

The current deployed version of GLUE is 1.2 and is distributed in VDT as X.500 schema together with the [[GenericInformationProviders][OSG-GIP]] (generic information provider).

[[http://infnforge.cnaf.infn.it/projects/glueinfomodel/][More information about the GLUE project]].  


---+++ History: GLUE Meeting at RAL
To work on the problems of the current schema and to provide a new version, there has been a meeting on February 25 at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) with representatives from the OSG, EGEE, LCG, Nordugrid, Globus and the R-GMA team (an EGEE project).  The GLUE schema v1.1 has an inadequate representation of the Storage Element (SE) and almost no VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo related information.  Nordugrid has voiced criticisms for the schema previously.   

Part of the discussions during the OSG-ITB workshop was to identify a logical path forward for working with our European colleagues on the schema issues, to the extent that time is not wasted and that progress for interoperability can be made. Since we currently have limited use of the current GLUE schema in OSG, to accommodate the requirements of other HEP related grids should not imply big development  efforts for OSG.  Approving a new GLUE version which solves at least the issues listed in the LCG minor upgrade proposal is a top priority for OSG, to be completed in the short time.  In general, we feel that a strategy of working iteratively with the LCG team and others interested in moving forward is the best approach.
To summarize, OSG is committed to working with LCG to evolve the GLUE schema so that interoperation between grids is possible, including for example: resource characterization, job submission, and data exchange. We hope this direction works favorably for each of the GLUE stake-holding groups.

*Today: GLUE v1.2*

As result of the meeting at RAL, version 1.2 of the GLUE schema has been defined, fixing some of the problems identified by the different Grids.
After several revisions the [[http://infnforge.cnaf.infn.it/glueinfomodel/uploads/Spec/GLUEInfoModel_1_2_final.pdf][final version of the GLUE 1.2 specification]] was released in December 2005.

Deployments of GLUE are available in LDAP (schema + IP), XML, relational form and there is a collaboration to provide a [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/ResourceSelection/CollaborationMeetingMarch2006][Condor ClassAd deploiment]].

More information about the [[http://infnforge.cnaf.infn.it/projects/glueinfomodel/][GLUE project (v1.2 and work for future versions)]].  

Glue revision [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Spec/V13][v1.3]] is under final stage of development and will be released soon. The changes included in the revision can be found [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Req/V13][here]]. Glue v1.3 is planned to be compatible with v1.2. There is no plan to include v1.3 with ITB 0.5.2 or OSG 0.6.0, but future releases are likely to use v1.3.

Discussions and work started already to prepare v2, that will be more service oriented and not backward compatible. Check the item in the actions [[#GLUEv2_future][below]] and the [[http://www.hicb.org/mailman/listinfo/glue-schema][list]] if you are interested in contributing.

---++ BDII
The Berkeley Database Information Index (<span class="acronym">BDII</span>) is an LCG implementation of Globus GIIS-like information index based on the Berkeley Database.  For USATLAS and USCMS, it can be used as a mechanism to make US LCG resources (CEs and SEs) within OSG visible to the LCG grid. BDII will be available for optional deployment in ITB 0.5.2. An independent path to publish GIP information using CEMon to the OSG/ITB BDII will be deployed by default with ITB 0.5.2 

<!--The deployment activity is not complete but due to its importance for two large stakeholders of the OSG, the Deployment Activity recommended that its integration be considered within the ITB.  Note that not all OSG sites in the ITB or in the Spring-deployed OSG 0.3.6 or 0.3.7 may be required to publish to LCG servers or OSG BDII.-->

Interoperability tests for job submission from an LCG resource broker using this scheme have already been exercised by US CMS and by iVDGL. For latest developments about the interoperability effort you can see Interoperability.OSGLcgInteroperability.

---++ Actions

---+++ OSG-ITB (now)
Within the OSG-ITB and in the following OSG deployment, the GIP (Generic Information Provider) for GLUE is installed as part of VDT and configured as described in [[GenericInformationProviders][GenericInformationProviders]].  

   * GIP will publish information to CEMon and BDII service (if BDII is enabled) at the OSG-ITB CE node. 
   * The resource will have to register using the form available at Operations.RegistrationInstructions#Resource_or_Service_Registration. The procedure for a site test and validation (including information systems) are detailed at Integration.VirtualWorkshopJan07#Validation 
   * The site will have to [[http://grow.uiowa.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php/projects/gipvalidate/index][pass the verifications]]
   * The site will publish information to the ITB/OSG BDII
   * It may be added also to other BDIIs (e.g. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo BDIIs)
   * The ITB BDII server is at is-itb.grid.iu.edu on port 2170
   * The OSG BDII server is running at is.grid.iu.edu on port 2170
   * You can check its content at http://scan.grid.iu.edu/ldap/index.html

For troubleshooting we identified actions to test information service (IS) infrastructure:
   * Perform a local test of the information provider. (running osg-info-wrapper)
   * Perform a local BDII query. (if installed)
   * Perform a query from OSG-ITB BDII server 

As interoperability test there are 2 possibilities
   * An LCG BDII server can query the site BDII and receive all the desired information
   * RB or a generic LCG submitter can use OSG-ITB BDII to get site information to send jobs

---+++ OSG-0.6.0 (near future)
Similar to ITB 0.5.2, but the production OSG BDII. 

---+++ GLUEv2 (future)
Comments and proposal started circulating in the GLUE mailing list at the end of 2005 but there have been objections of not having enough experience with GLUE v1.2 that is not yet (Mar 2006) fully deployed in LCG. Anyway discussions to define GLUE v2 are continuing on the [[http://www.hicb.org/mailman/listinfo/glue-schema][list]]. Details on the proposed changes in Glue v.2 can be found at [[http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Req/V20][http://glueschema.forge.cnaf.infn.it/Req/V20]]

GLUE 2 may not be backward compatible and will be more service oriented.
