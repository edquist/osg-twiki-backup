The  <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_cemon</i> script checks for this and creates an empty one, if none exists.  It is automatically run during the OSG 0.5.1 installation process.  So this should not  normally be a problem, but you should be aware of it.

<LI>If you do not have an HTTP certificate in <i>/etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem(httpkey.pem)</i> file or a symlink to one from that location, you will see this message in the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/tomcat/v5/logs/glite-ce-monitor.log</i> file.  The correct ownershop is critical, as well.

The <i>CEMon</i> configuration file <i>$VDT_LOCATION/glite/etc/glite-ce-monitor/cemonitor-config.xml</i> contains the entry for where the HTTP certificate and your <i>TRUSTED_CA</i>'s should exist.  The default installation is shown here:
<pre>
&lt; service id="main-service"
         description="cemonitor service"
         sslkeyfile="/etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem"

         sslCAfiles="/storage/local/data1/osg-ce/globus/TRUSTED_CA/*.0"

You can, of course, make the change here.  If you do, you need to restart <i>tomcat</i>.
