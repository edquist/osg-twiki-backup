---+!! The SRM/dCache Model for Local Storage
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

The SRM/dCache model is a superset of the [[LcgModel][LCG Model]], so this CE satisfies that model, too.  

In the SRM/dCache model, read access is via dcap, while write access is via srmcp only. DCache does not allow modification of a file once it is closed, although write access via dcap is possible in principle and could provide OSG_SITE_WRITE.  A typical deployment allows writes only via srmcp (i.e., OSG_DEFAULT_SE) while reads may use either srmcp (OSG_DEFAULT_SE) or dcap (OSG_SITE_READ). 

The current SRM implementation in dCache does not allow overwriting of logical files, This guarantees that all physical file replicas of the same logical file remain the same. 

The SRM/dCache model includes the following storage areas:
   * OSG_GRID
   * OSG_APP
   * OSG_SITE_READ
   * OSG_DEFAULT_SE
   * OSG_WN_TMP

A dataflow example may be: 
   * Site administrator's intervention or external transfer 
   * Job execution (open/seek/read from OSG_SITE_READ using dcap)
   * Srmcp: OSG_WN_TMP->OSG_DEFAULT_SE
   * External stage-out
