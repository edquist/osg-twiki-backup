---+ Installing OSG in the Minimal Suggested Configuration
%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

To be reliable, an OSG site, which includes both cluster and headnodes, must have at least two headnodes: one for the CE and one for the minimal SE configuration.

In this implementation, we suggest that large-scale data movement to go via the _Default SE_, transferring via the CE any small output files (O(a few MB)) that are directly retrieved by condor-g.

---++ To deploy the suggested minimal configuration
Follow the "Single Headnode Cluster" configuration above but separate components as follows:
   1. Install the CE on headnode 1. You must point "myheadnode.athome.edu" in the specification of "Default SE" to the nodename of headnode 2, the one that instantiates the gsiftp server.
   2. Install the gridftp server on headnode 2. The CE installation will also install a gridftp server. However, that gftp server will not be advertised in any way shape or form. It is required because the condor-g client uses it to retrieve those files that are specified in the jdl as output files. Condor-g implicitly assumes that the host that runs the GRAM also runs gsiftp.
   3. On headnode 2, export all file systems.


---++ OSG Compliance
This installation implements [[LocalStorageRequirements050#Grid3Model][Grid3 Model configuration]] and is thus OSG compliant.
