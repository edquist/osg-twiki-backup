---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to  [[OsgCEAuthorization][Osg CE Authorization]] document and authorize other users before performing the *OSG Registration* of your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!).  You should do this before doing the rest of the monitoring configuration steps below, otherwise you may  have to repeat the steps later, particularly if your site is using GUMS.

---++ Installing and Configuring Globus Web Services
Instructions and configuration of WS-GRAM can be viewed [[InstallAndConfigureGlobusWebServices][here]].

---++ OSG Registration

To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][webform]] located under the OSG [[http://info.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Main/GridAdminstratorSupport][Administrator Support page]]. If you have previously registered your resource with the OSG there is no need to fill out this form. If you are registering into the OSG, be sure to check the appropriate box for which grid catalog you are registering with. You should receive an email response automatically back from the GOC to the operations contact you supplied. If this response doesn't arrive within a reasonable delay, please resubmit your registration.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a site to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make site and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.
