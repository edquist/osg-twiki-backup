---++ Configuring the Public Key Infrastructure

Minimally, you will need a host certificate and private key to identify  your CE.  You may need the following additional certificates if you intend to activate certain optional components:
   * ldap certificate - for publishing the status of your Privilege authorization service (optional)
   * http certificate - for CEMon

%NOTE% These additional certificates can be clones of your host certificate, but this is not recommended for security reasons.

---+++ Setup and maintenance of Certificate Authority connection
Configure the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA) to be used by default by running the utility below. 

If you are given the option "<b>choose the option which matches "1c3f2ca8 : ...</b>", 
then enter =q= at the prompts.

<pre class="screen">

 Running grid-security-config...
 ......
</pre>

A [[http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.10/certificate_authorities.html][list of CAs]] were added as authorized CAs on your system. 

%IMPORTANT% In the past, you had the option of putting these certificates in the =/etc/grid-security/certificates= directory or in the local =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA= directory. *This is no longer an option.* The OSG installation is pre-configured to place the certificates in the local =TRUSTED_CA= directory.  The <i>fetch-crl</i> cron job will be updating CRLs in this local directory only. If you want to maintain certificates in the =/etc/grid-security/certificates= directory you should link it to the local =TRUSTED_CA= location (symlink in either direction) and copy the CA files appropriately.

Please review the list of authorized CAs and modify the set in <tt>$X509_CERT_DIR= $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA</tt> as needed to match your local policy.  

From OSG 0.5.0/VDT-1.3.11 and greater the daemon _edg-crl-upgrade_ has been replaced with a root cron job called _fetch-crl_ which runs daily from cron. This will  refresh the CRLs from these CAs.  Some of them expire in less than 1 day and you may find it necessary to increase the frequency of the fetch-crl to be more than daily.

The [[CertScripts][Certificate Scripts Package Guide]] which has been installed can assist you with choosing Certificate Authorities to trust and periodically checking that the CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) have not expired.

---+++ Request and Install Host Certificate
After the pacman installation of the OSG CE software completes you should have the _PPDG-Cert-Scripts_ package installed (in =$VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts=) and the instructions below show the use of those scripts.

To authorize this resource for use, a host certificate needs to be obtained from an appropriate Certificate Authority. 
   * Currently the [[http://www.doegrids.org][DOEGrids CA]] is the most common CA in use for OSG participants. 
   * The [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra][OSG Registration Authority]] with DOEGrids handles most certificate requests for OSG participants. 

Here is a brief guide to the process assuming you have a valid User Certificate. 
 
Run the =cert-request= script  to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>cd $VDT_LOCATION</b>
$ <b>source  ./setup.sh</b>
$ <b>cd <i>some-work-dir</i></b>
$ <b>cert-request -ou s -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>
Processing OU=Services request.
Give reason (1 line) you qualify for certificate, such as
  member of CMS experiment    or
  collaborating with Condor team,  etc.

You must agree to abide by the DOEGrids pollicies,
at
and you assert that you are authorized to request and install this
certificate on the specified host.
Do you agree (y,N): <b>y</b>

Your Certificate Request has been successfully submitted
Your Certificate Request id: <i>2394</i>

        You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate
        has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your
        certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</pre>

%NOTE% It is possible to go on and do most of the rest of the steps in the install guide while you are waiting for your host certificate to be approved.

After the certificate is approved you will receive an email which includes the serial number of the new certificate. Use that serial number to retrieve the certificate and move it to the installation directory.

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0x2e7</i> -dir . -label <i>my-host</i></b>
Checking that the usercert and ./my-hostkey.pem match

./usercert.pem and ./userkey.pem now contain your Globus credential

$ <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
$ <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem</b>
</pre>


The following command will verify the certificate is readable.  The output shown will be similar, but specific to your request.

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem</b>

</pre>
    
---+++ Get an LDAP service certificate to publish your Privilege authorization status
The capability of publishing the status of your Privilege authorization server's status is available in this release.  This is optional and you will be asked if you desire this capability when you configure your CE node using the =configure-osg.sh= script.  If you choose to publish this information, you will need an LDAP service certificate.

Follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating =ldapkey.pem= and =ldapcert.pem=.   This certificate should be should be located in the following directory with ownership and permissions as follows:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir /etc/grid-security/ldap </b>
$ <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem </b>
$ <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapcert.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/ldap/ldapkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chown -R daemon.daemon /etc/grid-security/ldap </b>
</pre>

---+++ Get an HTTP service certificate to activate CEMon
See the [[CEInstallGuide#CEmon][CEMon section of this guide]] for the details on activating this service.  You will need the http certificate available before you activate this service.  <i>CEMon</i> runs as a  <i>tomcat</i> service and therefore the HTTP certicate must be owned by the <i>tomcat</i> user (if you installed as <i>root</i>, the owner is probably <i>daemon</i>).

<pre class="screen">
&gt;  <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
&gt;  <b>cert-request -ou s</b> 
                -dir . \
                -host <i>my-host.some.domain</i> \
                -service http \
                -label <i>my-host-http</i>
</pre>

Follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating =httpkey.pem= and =httpcert.pem=.  This certificate should be should be located in the following directory with ownership and permissions as follows:

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>mkdir /etc/grid-security/http </b>
$ <b>mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/http/httpcert.pem </b>
$ <b>chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/http/httpkey.pem </b>
$ <b>chown -R daemon.daemon /etc/grid-security/http </b>
</pre>



---+++ Getting a Personal Grid Certificate (optional)
If you do not already have a personal grid certificate, which will be needed to run the tests, then you can request one in a similar manner to the host certificate described above. You should be logged in to the user account where you will normally initiate grid actions, and the commands below will place your certificate in the globus default location ( =~/.globus= ).  You should specify OSG for the RA affiliation and also for the VO unless you already know the more appropriate values to use.

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
$ <b>cert-request -ou p</b>
</pre>

After you receive email notification that the certificate have been issued, then you can retrieve it with the following command, and using the serial number shown in the email notice.

<pre class="screen">
$ <b>source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh</b>
$ <b>cert-retrieve -certnum <i>0xYYYY</i></b>
</pre>
