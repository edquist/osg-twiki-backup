---+ About the OSG_GRID Storage Area

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

The OSG_GRID is read-only storage area where CE administrators install the [[WorkerNodeClient][OSG-WN-Client package]].

Relative paths and content must be consistent between the gatekeeper and worker nodes, even if the base OSG_GRID directory is different. If OSG_GRID differs between the CE/gatekeeper and worker nodes, create softlinks on the worker node that will recreate the gatekeeper's base path for OSG_GRID.

Site administrators must provide a shared directory or locally install it on each machine. 

OSG_GRID may be included directly into the PATH defined for jobs running at the CE.

---+++ Typical uses of OSG_GRID
   * Provide a common set of OSG client software (=globus-job-run=, =globus-url-copy=, =srmcp=, etc.)

---+++ Notes
None.
