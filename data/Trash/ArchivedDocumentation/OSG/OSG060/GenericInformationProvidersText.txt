---++ Intro

This page is for comments and revisions of the questions that configure-osg-gip.sh asks.  The goal of this page is to have the most clear questions possible.

---++ SRM Information

Do you want to publish your srm information through GIP (Y/n): [n]

---++ GUMS Monitoring

Do you want to publish your gums monitoring information through GIP (Y/n): [n]

---++ GSIFTP Installation

---+++ Original

Do you also wish to publish your gsiftp information (Y/n): [Y]

We noticed that your Default SE (UNAVAILABLE), is different than your CE host (grow-test1.its.uiowa.edu).

Please enter SE where the gsiftp server is running: [UNAVAILABLE]

Please enter the Access Path to the data directory on UNAVAILABLE: [UNAVAILABLE]

---+++ New

Does ce.hostname have a gsiftp access to $OSG_DATA (Y/n): [y]

Please enter the path where $OSG_DATA can be accessed on ce.hostname [default_to_$OSG_DATA]:

(if they define a default_se)

Does default_se.hostname have access to $OSG_DATA (Y/n): [y]

Please enter the path where $OSG_DATA can be accessed on default_se.hostname [default_to_$OSG_DATA]:

(loop multiple times)

Is there another gsiftp storage element that you would like to publish (Y/n): [n]

Please enter SE where the gsiftp server is running: [UNAVAILABLE]

Is this SE an access point to $OSG_DATA (Y/n): [y]

(if yes)

Please enter the path where the $OSG_DATA directory is available on se.hostname: [default_to_OSG_DATA]

(if no)

Please enter the path where the data should be placed on se.hostname: [UNAVAILABLE]

(end loop)


---+++ Discussion

If $OSG_DEFAULT_SE is UNAVAILABLE then don't ask questions about it.  If it is set, then ask questions about that first.

---++ SRM Questions

What is the siteName of your srm Storage Element? (e.g. UIOWA-ITB): [UNAVAILABLE]

What is the hostname of your srm Storage Element? (e.g. rsgrid3.its.uiowa.edu) : [UNAVAILABLE]

(This will be your base directory, e.g if your accessible path is your cms accessible area is "/pnfs/xxxx.edu/data1/cms") your full 
access path may be "/pnfs/xxxx.edu/"
What is the Full path of the root directory for this storage area? : [UNAVAILABLE]
Do you want to use a simplified version where all supported VOs will be assigned the same local directory (Y/n): [y]

---+++ Simplified Setup Options

What is the local directory that is the root for all vos [UNAVAILABLE] ?

---+++ Non-simplified Setup Options

Next you will set the local directories for the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo's.
( This is the relative path, e.g if your accessible path is your cms accessible area is "/pnfs/xxxx.edu/data1/cms") your root access path 
may be "data/cms"
If any VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo does not have a srmcp-able directory, just hit enter)
If you would like to delete a previously supported VO, type UNAVAILABLE
... to continue hit <ENTER>

What is the local directory that is the root of this vo, grow [UNAVAILABLE]?
