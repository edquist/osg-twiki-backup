---++ Introduction
%EDITTHIS%

This is a minimal set of executables that need to be made available to the worker nodes in a Compute Element.



There are essentially three installation options:

   1. _Suggested Installation:_ Install the wn-client package on the file server separate from the CE that you use for $APP. You will be installing the fetch-crl program onto this node, which requires root access, and adds a script into cron . The updates require outgoing network access from the node it is installed on.  (Should arrange to make it accessible from the CE as well). %BR% %BR%  _(S. Timm note: What happens  once the WN-client starts to include SUID executables, which it eventually will?  This mode won't work then.)_
   1. _CE installation:_ Install the wn-client package on your CE. While we do not suggest you do this, we provide instructions, and support this installation as an option.  
   1. _Local Installation:_  In principle, it is possible to install the wn-client package locally on all worker nodes. In practice, this introduces a number of complications due to the edg-crl updates. We include a set of instructions for this from Alan Sill, but do not support this installation variant officially via OSG operations.

In all cases you need to choose a path that is common to all worker nodes (and the CE?!) You will be prompted for this path when running the =configure-osg.sh= script on the gatekeeper in order to set the =$OSG_GRID= variable.

A full log of an installation is below, followed by comments on why each choice is made.

VDT 1.6.1 installs a variety of software, each with its own license.
In order to continue, you must agree to the licenses.
You can view the licenses online at:

     http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/licenses/1.6.1

After the installation has completed, you will also be able to
view the licenses in the "licenses" directory.

Do you agree to the licenses? [y/n] <b>y</b>

Do you want to run a cron job that will update the CA certificate
revocation lists automatically? This will use the fetch-crl program
that comes with the VDT. The cron job will run at a random time
between midnight and 6:00am. We select a random time to avoid having
all VDT installations fetching CRLs at the same time.

Do you want to update the CA certification revocation lists (CRLs) automatically? [y/n] <b>y</b>

The VDT typically installs public certificates and signing policy files
for the well-known public CA's. This is necessary in order for you to
perform GSI authentication with any remote Grid services (that have
service/host certificates signed by these CA's).

For more information please refer to the VDT documentation:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/setup_ca.html

Where would you like to install CA files?

Choices:
        r (root)  - install into /etc/grid-security/certificates
                   (existing CA files will be preserved)
        l (local) - install into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates
        n (no)    - do not install
<b>l</b>
......

Several services provided by the VDT create unbounded log files.  If you wish, we can rotate those file on a daily basis.

Would you like to setup daily rotation of VDT log files?

Possible Answers:
     y: Yes. Please remove any old instances of the service and run
        this one..
     n: No. Please remove any old instances of the service, but don't
        run this one.

The installation will first ask if you trust the pacman caches, and then if you agree to the VDT licenses.  

It then asks where you would like to install the CA files and whether to run the fetch-crl cron script.

---++++ Option 1
For the suggested installation option, i.e. option (1) where you install this worker node client package on the file server that serves $APP, and you have no previous installation of the fetch-crl cron script, you should answer =l= (lowercase letter L) for the location and =y= to run the fetch-crl cron.


---++++ Option 3
For option (3) installation on every worker node, answer =l= (lowercase letter L) for local and =y= for running the cron script.
---++++ Option 2
If you are installing this worker node client on the OSG CE, i.e. option (2) answer =l= (lowercase letter L) for local location of CRL and =n= on running the cron script.

---++Automation
This process on many worker nodes can be automated with the following script so you don't have to type in the letters.

<noautolink>
<pre class="programlisting">
VDTSETUP_AGREE_TO_LICENSES=y
export VDTSETUP_AGREE_TO_LICENSES
VDTSETUP_INSTALL_CERTS=l
export VDTSETUP_INSTALL_CERTS
VDTSETUP_EDG_CRL_UPDATE=y
export VDTSETUP_EDG_CRL_UPDATE
VDTSETUP_ENABLE_ROTATE=n
export VDTSETUP_ENABLE_ROTATE
pacman -trust-all-caches -get ITB:wn-client
</pre></noautolink> 

---++Post-install checks
If the OSG WN client is installed along with some other VDT package on any given node, the CE for instance, as in option 2, you should do the following steps afterwards.

Look at =crontab -l= for root, make sure that the fetch-crl that is there is running from the correct area. Make sure that it's sourcing the correct location.

For example, if the OSG CE is installed in =/usr/local/vdt= , then the OSG WN Client is installed in =/usr/local/grid=


Look at the =/usr/local/grid/globus/TRUSTED_CA= link. It should point to the real area where your certificates will live, in this example =/usr/local/vdt/globus/share/certificates= . If it doesn't, change it to that location.

<noautolink>
<pre class="screen">
[root@fgtest3 globus]# pwd
/usr/local/grid/globus
[root@fgtest3 globus]# ls -l TRUSTED_CA
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 41 Mar 16 15:44 TRUSTED_CA -> /usr/local/grid/globus/share/certificates
rm TRUSTED_CA
ln -s /usr/local/vdt/globus/share/certificates TRUSTED_CA
</pre></noautolink>

Also note, if Condor is involved, should also make a symlink from =/etc/grid-security/certificate= to =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates= .

---++Notes
%IMPORTANT% If you are installing this package on a head node / compute element where an OSG CE install will also be done afterwards, it is recommended that you log out and log back in before continuing with the main OSG CE Install, otherwise all the wn-client stuff will be in your path and confuse everything.
d202 3
%IMPORTANT% A side effect of the worker node client as currently configured, is that $GLOBUS_LOCATION can and does wind up in a different location on the head node than it does on the worker node.  The environment at the beginning of the job will give you $GLOBUS_LOCATION on the head node.  You have to source =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= to get where $GLOBUS_LOCATION is available to you on the worker node. %BR% %BR%   To avoid this, it is required to add an appropriate softlink on every worker node such that $GLOBUS_LOCATION as defined on the head node points to the place where it is located on the worker node after the wn client installation. E.g., CMS analysis jobs submitted via Resource Broker will presently fail without this softlink.

Installation of the worker node client package does imply maintenance of the certificates that it installs.  As an alternative, it is possible to simply rsync the installed full osg installation to the worker nodes, and independently of whether this option is chosen, use rsync to keep the certificates up to date.   This is true as long as the "Worker Node Client" pacman package remains a pure subset of the OSG CE installation, which is true at the moment.
need to do multiple pacman updates every time a new CA-Certificates package comes out, which 
expecting it to be there, so it must be made available somewhere.

Doing anything automatically on the worker nodes requires care.  An example script that looks to see what worker nodes on a cluster using pbsnodes is attached to this page.  It can be edited or replaced with a more general version to match your specific cluster conditions.  Note that the example script does not use the batch system itself, but uses a feature of the local batch scheduler to avoid trying to push certificates to worker nodes that are down and to build a list of operating nodes to receive the update.  To use this script with the greatest amount of integration into existing certificate update procedures, it can be called just after the edg-fetch-crl call in the edg/sbin/edg-crl-upgrade script that should be in the edg/sbin area of your OSG VDT installation.  Example code to do so would look like:

<pre class="programlisting">
# Add section to upgrade the worker nodes:
    if [ -x $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/wn-cert-sync ]; then
        $VDT_LOCATION/edg/sbin/wn-cert-sync -l $CRL_UPGRADE_PATH -q
    else
        echo "In edg-crl-upgrade: Worker node certificates not synchronized! "
    fi
</pre>

where =wn-cert-sync= is a soft link to your particular cluster's worker node certificate synchronization script, as in the example attached. (Customize one to your cluster configuration.)
   * This issue deserves further discussion and repair in the current OSG releases.
