---++ CE changes for this release
%EDITTHIS%

---+++ CRL updates
The CRL update process that ran as a daemon (<i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i>) has been converted to a <i>root</i> cron process.  The time will be selected randomly at installation time so as to reduce contention for these updates.

<pre class="programlisting">
  6 1 * * * YOUR_VDT_LOCATION/fetch-crl/share/doc/fetch-crl-2.6.0/fetch-crl.cron
</pre>

%IMPORTANT% You will need to manually remove the <i>/etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded</i> before performing this installation.

---+++ <i>vdt-control</i> script for startup/shutdown of processes/crons
A new capability has been provided in this release for startup and shutdown of OSG daemons and crons.

---++ CE deprecated components for this release
---+++ GRIS/ldap server 
The GRIS ldap server has been deprecated in this release.

%IMPORTANT% You will need to manually remove the <i>/etc/init.d/gris</i> before performing this installation.

---+++MIS-CI service
The MIS-CI  service is no longer installed in this release of OSG. 

%IMPORTANT% There was a cron process associated with that service is no longer needed. So if you are upgrading from a previous release, you should remove this cron entry for the <i>mis</i> user.

---++ CE new components for this release

---+++ CEMon
<i>CEMon</i> has been added.  CEMon replaces the gris service that was used in previous versions of OSG and sends information to a resource selection service and to a BDII server at the GOC.

---+++ BDII

<i>BDII</i> has been added.  The GOC is now running a BDII collector that gets information from CEMon services running on the CE and provides this to allow users to get informations on sites that are available on the grid.

---+++ Gratia
<i>Gratia</i> has been added.  Gratia collects job and accounting information reports this information to a server at Fermilab.  


---++ Resolved CE problems/issues for this release.
There is nothing specific to OSG to report here.
