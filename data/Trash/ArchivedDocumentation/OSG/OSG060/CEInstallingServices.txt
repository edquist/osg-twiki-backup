---+!!<nop>OSG CE - Installing the Services
%TOC%
%STARTINCLUDE%


---++ Installing OSG CE Services

Now you're ready to start installing the Compute Element (CE) services.  We distinguish between software that must be installed on the server/gatekeeper (eg., ce.pacman), and software which must be executable from the worker nodes.

This section addresses the software executed on the CE (server/gatekeeper node).  

---+++ Choose an installation directory 
This is typically something like <tt>/usr/local/grid</tt>, but whatever suits the local resource structure is fine. 
This directory does not need to be shared to the worker nodes.  Any software which needs to be seen from the worker nodes may be provided by the worker node client package as described above. 

For example (shown for sh, bash):
<pre>
&gt; export VDT_LOCATION=/usr/local/grid
&gt; cd $VDT_LOCATION
</pre>

---+++Installing the OSG CE software package
The installation described here is done as root. Even though services will not run as root:
<UL>
<LI>Condor, MonaLisa and the GRIS will run as the user "daemon".   
<LI><font color=blue><b>Verify that the umask is set to "0022" prior to installation.  Failure to do so may render the installation unusable.</b></font>
<LI>A few questions regarding trust of the caches from which the software is downloaded will be displayed. 
   <br>Please answer *y* (yes) so that the software can be retrieved.
<LI>Finally, make sure there are no non-standard versions of perl, tcsh, or bash in your $PATH variable.
</UL>

The following pacman commands will install the OSG software packages.
<pre>
   &gt;  pacman -get OSG:ce
</pre>

See the [[PacmanInfo050][Pacman section]] of this guide if you encounter an 'unsupported' platform message.

<font color=blue><b>This will take between 10 and 60 minutes to complete, depending
upon the system and network connection.</b></font> During this time you may open a second 
terminal and watch the progress by monitoring the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log</i> file.

You should not be asked any other questions during the installation process.

The installation should complete with the following message. 
<pre>
Downloading [srmclient-1.23.tar.gz] from [pacman.uits.indiana.edu]...
         6/6 MB downloaded...

  Pacman Installation of OSG-0.5.0 Complete

 Assuming the Pacman install completed without fatal errors, you should now be able to source the OSG setup environment. In your installation directory, from here forward known as the <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i> and source the setup script.

---+++ Optional packages for Condor, PBS, LSF, FBSNG, or SGE
<font color=blue>Ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path</font>, then install the appropriate package in your $VDT_LOCATION directory (for Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE respectively):  
<font color=blue>Ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path</font>, then install the appropriate package in your <i>$VDT_LOCATION</i> directory (for Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE respectively):  
% source setup.csh
</pre> 

---+++ Optional packages for Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE
You need to install an extra package to interface with your existing  Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE installation. *%BLUE% Ensure that that the command-line utilities for your batch system are in your path,%ENDCOLOR%* then install the appropriate package in your =$VDT_LOCATION= directory (for Condor, PBS, LSF, or SGE respectively).  Choose one of the following as appropriate:  
For OSG-ITB substitute <i>IVDGL</i> for <i>OSG</i>:
For OSG-ITB substitute <i>ITB</i> for <i>OSG</i>:
&gt; pacman -get iVDGL:Globus-Condor-Setup
</pre>
<pre>
  and so forth.

This guide will not go into the detail on the installation of any of these optional packages.
Globus-XXX-Setup will include web-services (Globus-WS-XXX-Setup) and Gratia probes EXCEPT for SGE batch systems. SGE versions are still in development.
  
Read the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README file</i>.   
We suggest that you read the file for information only, and follow the instructions in the various OSG installation guides presented in these pages, rather than those in the VDT README file.  

<font color=blue><b>Note: Do not be concerned with any error messages you may see in this README file.  They are usually not a problem.</b></font>
%NOTE% For the PBS connector, make sure your binaries are in the path prior to installation.  The install will fail silently with error reported to =vdt-install.log= and jobmanager-pbs will not be created.  If this is done, do a =<userinput>pacman -remove ITB:Globus-PBS-Setup</userinput>=, insert the binaries into your PATH and install again.

---+++ Post install README
Read the =$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README= file. We suggest that you read the file for information only, and follow the instructions in the various OSG installation guides presented in these pages, rather than those in the VDT README file.
