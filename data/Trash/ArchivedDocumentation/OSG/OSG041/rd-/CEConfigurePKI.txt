---++ Configuring the Public Key Infrastructure
Minimally, you will need a host certificate and private key to identify of your CE.

---+++ Setup and maintenance of Certificate Authority connection
Configure the DOEGrids Certificate Authority (CA) to be used by default by running the utility below. 

If you are given the option "<b>choose the option which matches "1c3f2ca8 : ...</b>", <br>
then enter "<b>q</b>" at the prompts.
<pre>
  &gt; $VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/setup-cert-request
  Reading from /g3dev/globus/TRUSTED_CA
  Using hash: 1c3f2ca8
  Setting up grid-cert-request
  Running grid-security-config...
  ......
</pre>

A <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/vdt/releases/1.3.10/certificate_authorities.html">list of CAs</a> were added as authorized CAs on your system. 

<b>Important Note:</b> In the past, you had the option of putting these certificates in the 
<i>/etc/grid-security/certificates</i> directory or in the local <i>$VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA</i> directory.
<b>This is no longer an option.</b>  
The OSG installation is pre-configured to place the certificates in 
the local <i>TRUSTED_CA</i> directory.  The <i>edg-crl-upgrade</i> daemon will be updating CRLs in this local directory only. 
 If you want to maintain certificates in the <i>/etc/grid-security/certificates</i> directory you should 
 link it to the local <i>TRUSTED_CA</i> location (symlink in either direction) and copy the CA files appropriately.

Please review the list of authorized CAs and modify the set in $X509_CERT_DIR= $VDT_LOCATION/globus/TRUSTED_CA as needed to match your local policy.  

The daemon <i>edg-crl-upgrade</i> should be running at all times in the background to refresh the CRLs from these CAs.  If CRLs are not kept current, incoming connections will fail. 

To check that it's running:
<pre>
&gt; ps axwww | grep edg-crl-upgrade
</pre>

If not running, do
<pre>
&gt; /etc/init.d/edg-crl-upgraded start
</pre>


The <a href="http://info.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/CertScripts">Certificate Scripts Package Guide</a> which has been installed can assist you with choosing Certificate Authorities to trust and periodically checking that the CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) have not expired.

---+++ Request and Install Host Certificate
After the pacman installation of the OSG CE software completes you should have the PPDG-Cert-Scripts  package installed (in $VDT_LOCATION/cert-scripts) and the instructions below show the use of those scripts.

To authorize this resource for use, a host certificate needs to be obtained from an appropriate Certificate Authority. 
<UL>
<LI>Currently the  <a href="http://www.doegrids.org"> DOEGrids CA</a> is the most common CA in use for OSG participants. 
<LI>The iVDGL and PPDG project instructions for getting a certificate are available on the <a href="http://igoc.ivdgl.indiana.edu/RAinfo/newra/">iVDGL RA</a> and <a href="http://www.ppdg.net/RA">PPDG RA</a> sites (RA is Registration Authority). 
</UL>
    
Here is a brief guide to the process assuming you have a valid User Certificate. 
 
Run the <i>cert-request</i> script  to generate your host's private key (<tt>hostkey.pem</tt>) and submit the certificate request.
<pre>
   $ cd $VDT_LOCATION
   $ source  ./setup.sh
   $ cert-request -ou s -dir .
   Processing OU=Services request.
   Give reason (1 line) you qualify for certificate, such as
     member of CMS experiment    or
     collaborating with Condor team,  etc.
    reason: <b><i>testing for PPDG</i></b>
   input full hostname: <b><i>goofy.looney.tunes</i></b>
   Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
.   ....................................+++
    ..................+++
    writing new private key to './5842key.pem'

   Your Certificate Request has been successfully submitted
   Your Certificate Request id: 2005

        You will receive a notification email from the CA when your certificate
        has been issued. Please disregard the instructions to download your
        certificate though a web browser and use the cert-retrieve script instead.
</pre>

After the certificate is approved you will receive an email which includes the serial number of the new certificate.  Use that serial number to retrieve the certificate and move it to the installation directory.
<pre>
  &gt; cert-retrieve -dir . -certnum 0x299
   using CA doegrids
   Checking that the usercert and ./5842key.pem match
   writing RSA key
   ./usercert.pem and ./userkey.pem now contain your Globus credential

   &gt; mv ./usercert.pem /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
   &gt; mv ./userkey.pem /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
   &gt; chmod 444 /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem
   &gt; chmod 400 /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
</pre>


The following command will verify the certificate is readable.  The output shown will be similar, but specific to your request.
<pre>
   &gt; openssl x509 -text -noout -in /etc/grid-security/hostcert.pem

   Certificate:
       Data:
           Version: 3 (0x2)
           Serial Number: 665 (0x299)
           Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption

---+++ Get an LDAP service certificate to run authenticated MDS (optional)
MDS is the monitoring and directory service. The GRIS (Grid Resource info service, a sensor that collects site data and publishes it to MDS) is 
configured by default to allow anonymous access only.  Only those sites which keep anonymous access available will be able to publish their information to the OSG BDII. 

Instructions are in the 
$VDT_LOCATION/post-install/README on how to allow only authenticated and authorized access.  Authenticated access requires an LDAP service certificate (two files), owned by the MDS owner (if you installed as root, the owner is probably daemon -- check).
<pre>
   $ source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
   $ cert-request -ou s -dir . -host <i>hostname.domain.tld</i> -service ldap
</pre>
And follow the instructions, which are very similar to the host cert instructions, except that you are creating <b>ldapkey.pem</b> and <b>ldapcert.pem</b>.
