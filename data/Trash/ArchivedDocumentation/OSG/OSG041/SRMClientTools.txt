%STARTINCLUDE%

---++ Introduction
  
     The SRM client tools are an optional module in the OSG Cache.
     The SRM Shell-tool client provides a command line interface to the SRM V1.1  standard. 
     The package is supported for the standard interfaces to the dCache, DRM and Castor implementations of SRM.

---++ Latest Version
       v1.21

---++ Installation Instructions
     Assuming the installation directory is $VDT_LOCATION- follow the steps below: 
    
  Step1)<pre> cd $VDT_LOCATION</pre>
  Step 2)<pre> pacman -get OSG:srm-cp
               Do you want to add [http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/] to [trusted.caches]? (y or n): y
               Package [srm-cp] found in [http://hep.uchicago.edu/ivdgl/]...
               Downloading [srmclient.tar.gz] from [hep.uchicago.edu]...
               6/6 MB downloaded...
               Untarring [srmclient.tar.gz]... </pre>
 Step 3)<pre> ls
              cert-scripts  gpt        MIS-CI                   perl          trusted.caches     vdt-questions.sh
              condor        gums       MonaLisa                 post-install  vds                verify
              edg           jdk1.4     monitoring               prima         vdt                voms
              expat         lcg        o..pacman..o             setup.csh     vdt-app-data
              ftsh          licenses   OSGv0.1.6-release.notes  setup.sh      vdt-install.log
              globus        logrotate  osg-version              srmclient     vdt-questions.csh</pre>
 Step 4)<pre> <tam01.fnal.gov> source setup.sh </pre>
 Step 5)<pre> <tam01.fnal.gov> which srmcp
         /gfs0/osg/osg-software/srmclient/bin/srmcp </pre>

 Note:  The install creates a directory _srmclient_ under the $VDT_LOCATION
      
        It also adds few lines in the _$VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh_ and _$VDT_LOCATION/setup.csh_ scripts to include srmclient binaries in $PATH

---++ New features
---+++ commands
    *srmstage* - This command provides an option to the user to stage files from enstore to dcache and not transfer them right away. 
    This case will be useful if files are not needed right away at user end, but its good to stage them to dcache for faster access later. 

    Usage: <pre>srmstage srm-url [[srm-url] ... ]</pre>

---+++ command-line options
     The following command line options are available
 
     <pre>gss_expected_name
globus_tcp_port_range
streams_num
server_mode</pre>

     _Note_: Run <pre>srmcp --help</pre> for listing other available options.

     *<u>Description</u>*

     <pre>globus_tcp_port_range =min value,max value </pre>       
     To specify a range of ports open for tcp connections as a pair of positive integers separated by ",", not set by default
     This takes care of compute nodes that are behind firewall.
     
     <pre>gss_expected_name</pre> 
     To specify the gss expected name in the srm server DN, default value is host. 
     eg: If the CN of host where srm server is running is _CN=srm/tam01.fnal.gov_, then it should be _"srm"_

     <pre>streams_num</pre>
     To specify the number of streams to be used for data transfer. 
     If set to 1, then _stream mode_ is used, otherwise _extended block mode_ is used. 
 
     <pre>server_mode</pre>
     To set the (gridftp) server mode for data transfer. Can be _active_ or _passive_, _passive_ by default. 
     This option will have effect only if transfer is performed in a stream mode (see _streams_num_)

     *<u>Examples</u>*
  <pre>srmcp -debug file://localhost//home/s1/neha/test/aaa srm://t2data2.sdsc.edu:8443/data/osgtest/1/file1

srmcp -debug file:////home/s1/neha/rf-changelog.xml-ori srm://fledgling06.fnal.gov:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/litvinse/NULL/neha/test

srmcp -debug srm://fledgling06.fnal.gov:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/litvinse/NULL/neha/test file:////home/s1/neha/test2

srmcp -debug srm://fledgling06.fnal.gov:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/litvinse/NULL/neha/test srm://fledgling05.fnal.gov:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/data/neha/test3

srmcp --streams_num=1 --server_mode=active source-url destination-url </pre>

---+++Other improvements/fixes

    *More robust 'srm' script*. In previous versions, srm script assumes that 'java' exists and is in the user $PATH . 
    In this current version, script looks for java in various standard locations and under $JAVA_HOME if defined. 
    In case of multiple java versions found, the most recent version is selected.

    *Reliable srmcp return codes*. The return code is 0 only if all individual file transfers are successful.
    In case of any failure, the return code is 1. 

---++Certificate access 

    Worker node on which srmcp is run needs to access certificates directory

    Either service certs will need to be preinstalled and maintained, or 
    they need to be copied to the worker node together with other job 
    specific files. 

    Certificates can be installed into $VDT_LOCATION/globus/share/certificates.

    The CRL must then be maintained by hand as  the edg-crl-upgrade scripts 
   (which are part of VDT) are hardcoded to point to /etc/grid-security/certificates.

---++ FAQ
   
     Q1. _How does user know which gss_expected_name is to be used?_
<pre>The way srmclient works now,the user has to know in advance.This is not a time consuming job.
Its very easy to find out whether the DN is of form host/... or srm/... or blah/...</pre>

          _Yes, the user has to know in advance, but how does user find out from where?I don't think the DN itself of SRM is published, but only the service handles._

<pre>The way that I know is for user to issue one test srmcp command. Example- If I run command like
srmcp -debug --gss_expected_name=srm srm://fledgling06.fnal.gov:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/litvinse/NULL/neha/test 
file:////home/s1/neha/test2</pre>

<pre>I get following error message
SRMClientV1 : org.globus.common.ChainedIOException: Authentication failed [Caused by: Operation unauthorized (Mechanism level: Authorization failed. 
Expected "/CN=srm/fledgling06.fnal.gov" target but received "/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=Services/CN=host/fledgling06.fnal.gov")]

which tells me that I need to use 'host' as the 'gss_expected_name'.
So the correct command would be:
srmcp -debug srm://fledgling06.fnal.gov:8443//srm/managerv1?SFN=/pnfs/fnal.gov/litvinse/NULL/neha/test file:////home/s1/neha/test2
because by default - gss_expected_name is 'host'</pre>

    SRM interface is defined  at http://sdm.lbl.gov/srm-wg/index.html.

---++ Support

    This is supported by the SRM-dCACHE team. For the short term requests for information and support should go to osg-int@opensciencegrid.org

    Support for such a component needs a triage structure, since the SRM support group does not have the resources to support 
    diagnosis of the end to end problems that occur in the use of an SRM client<->SRM server<->storage service (SE). 
    Our proposal, for discussion, is the following:

    VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo support is the first level contact

    SE resource provider is the second level contact

    SRM client package provider is the third level contact - at the moment this is osg-int@opensciencegrid.org
