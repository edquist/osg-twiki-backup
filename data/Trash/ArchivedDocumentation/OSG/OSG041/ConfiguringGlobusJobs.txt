---++ Configuring Globus and Your Job Manager

---+++ Globus Configuration

Globus has been pre-configured for this installation. If you wish
reconfigure it, please review the <a href="http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.3.10/config/configure_globus_gatekeeper.html"> VDT
Globus Configuration Script</a> document on using
the =$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_globus_gatekeeper= script. 

Review the configuration files =/etc/xinetd.d/globus-gatekeeper= and
=/etc/xinetd.d/gsiftp= (or in =/etc/inetd.conf=) that were created during the pacman installation.
Additionally, =/etc/services= file was updated with the following entries:
<pre>  
  gsiftp                  2811/tcp       # Added by the VDT
  globus-gatekeeper       2119/tcp       # Added by the VDT
</pre>

If you are satisfied with this configuration, restart the xinetd (or inetd) daemon to pick up the configuration changes:
<pre>  /etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart
  Stopping xinetd:                       [  OK  ]
  Starting xinetd:                       [  OK  ]
</pre>

To verify that the gatekeeper is running at this point, you should be able to telnet to the public IP address of your site on port 2119 and get a response.
=telnet _hostname port_=

It should return =Connected to...=. The same should be true of the gsiftp port (2811 by default).


---+++ Job Policy and the Batch Queuing System 

The configuration of a production queue manager is beyond the scope of this document. Since there will be periodic validation submitted by DNs in the "mis" VO, it is recommended sites provide at least two levels of priority and assign the lowest priority to user mapped to the "mis" VO.
