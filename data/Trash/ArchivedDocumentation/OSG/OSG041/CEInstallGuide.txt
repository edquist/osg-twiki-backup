---++Monitoring Setup

---+++ Configure MIS-CI
The Monitoring and Information Services Core Infrastructure (MIS-CI) provides 
information on the site environment and computing resources. The OSG-CE package includes MIS-CI. 
This section describes how to configure MIS-CI if you wish to enable it.

The $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/configure-misci.sh script performs the configuration. It
creates or adds a crontab for the MIS-CI information collectors. The Unix account for the MIS-CI scripts should be <b>mis</b>. By default, the script assumes the !GridCat DN is mapped to the ivdgl user.  You will need to use the <b>--choose_user</b> option to change to <b>mis</b>.
<pre>
   $  cd $VDT_LOCATION
   $  SOURCE  ./setup.sh
   $  $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/configure-misci.sh --choose_user

            :
       Would you like to set up MIS-CI cron now? (y/n) <b>y</b>
       At what frequency (in minutes) would you like to run MIS-CI ? [10] <b>10</b>
       Under which account the cron should run ? [ivdgl] <b>mis</b>

      If you would like to add more vo users,
      you should edit /storage/local/data1/osg/MIS-CI/etc/misci/mis-ci-site-info.cfg.
      You have additional batch managers :  condor .
      If you would like to add these,
      you should edit /storage/local/data1/osg/MIS-CI/etc/misci/mis-ci-site-info.cfg.

      Please read /storage/local/data1/osg/MIS-CI/README
</pre>


MIS-CI is collecting information using crontab as the user mis (or ivdgl if you left it as the default). Therefore, in order to stop
MIS-CI processes, crontab should be removed. The script $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/uninstall-misci.sh
is provided for this purpose:
<pre>
      &gt;  cd $VDT_LOCATION
      &gt;  source setup.(c)sh
      &gt;  cd MIS-CI
      &gt;  ./uninstall-misci.sh
</pre>

After finishing configuring the MIS-CI, a few checks might be necessary:
<OL>
<LI> Verify the crontab was created for the <i>mis</i> user.
 <pre>
      &gt;  crontab -u mis -l
</pre>
<LI> If you want to force an MIS-CI table update (due to fresh install or update), then as the MIS-CI user (<i>mis</i>), execute:
<pre>
   &gt;  $VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/sbin/run-mis-ci.sh
</pre>
<LI>  As a non-root user, verify that at least one table is filled.<br>
           <b>If you chose not to force an update, it might take 10 minutes or so before the tables are filled with current information.</b>
<pre>
    &gt;   source $VDT_LOCATION/.setup.(c)sh

---+++ Configure MDS (GRIS)
The Globus information system is called MDS and is pre-configured to read the osg-attributes.conf information file.   

The configuration script (<i>VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_mds</i>) is executed automatically during the initial download with default values   It also install the <i>gris</i> daemon as an /etc/rc.d service.  

The <i>gris</i> daemon should have been started as a part of the initial installation.  To verify:
<pre>
&gt;  ps -efwww |grep ldap
daemon    7584     1  0 15:25 ?        00:00:00 /bin/sh  /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/sbin/grid-info-soft-register 
                      -log  /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/var/grid-info-system.log 
                      -f  /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/etc/grid-info-resource-register.conf 
                      -- /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/libexec/grid-info-slapd 
                      -h ldap://0.0.0.0:2135 -d 0 
                      -f /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/etc/grid-info-slapd.conf
daemon    7627  7584  1 15:25 ?        00:00:00 /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/libexec/slapd 
                      -h ldap://0.0.0.0:2135 -d 0 -f /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/etc/grid-info-slapd.conf
daemon    7639     1  0 15:25 ?        00:00:00 /bin/sh  /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/sbin/grid-info-soft-register
                      -log /storage/local/data1/osg/globus/var/grid-info-system.log -register -t mdsreg2
                      -h cmssrv09.fnal.gov -p 2135 -period 600 
                     -dn Mds-Vo-Op-name=register, Mds-Vo-name=ITB_INSTALL_TEST, o=grid -daemon -t ldap 
                      -h cmssrv09.fnal.gov -p 2135 -ttl 1200 -r Mds-Vo-name=local, o=grid -T 20 -b ANONYM-ONLY 
                     -z 0 -m cachedump -period 30
</pre>
If it is not running, you will need to restart it:
<pre>
<b>Usage:</b>
   &gt; /etc/init.d/gris  [start | stop ]
</pre>


MDS should be configured for anonymous bind.  You can  send a test query to your local host which will perform no authentication on the user submitting the request .  First, verify you have no proxy certificate (/tmp/x509u_(your_PID)).  If one exists,  remove it first.  Then, 
<pre>
&gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
&gt;  grid-info-search -anonymous
<i>... your screen should scroll for a while showing a lot of data... 
....you can redirect the output to validate</i>
</pre>


---++Activate Your Site
The !GridCat system maintains status and other information on all OSG sites as can be viewed 
<a href="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">here</a>. 

Sites added to !GridCat are presumed to be inactive if a site state bit is not set to be 1 (see below).
<UL>
<LI><b>Inactive</b> sites will have the site status dot with the grey color. 
<LI> Once the site becomes <b>active</b>, the site status dot will become either green or red, depending on the 
<a href="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">GridCat</a>.
test results.
</UL>
Since the default site state is presumed to be inactive, the CE site administrator  has to pro-actively switch the site state to be active. The activation is done by modifying the file <i>$VDT_LOCATION/MIS-CI/etc/grid-site-state-info</i>. and setting the value to 1 for the variable below:
<pre>
export grid_site_state_bit =  1
</pre>

<b>NOTE: It might take up to 2 hours for registered sites to take effect in the !GridCat display. If your site is not registered with the OSG-GOC see the instructions in the 
<a href="#OSG_Registration">OSG Registration section</a> of this document. Until your site is registered, it will not appear in 
<a href="http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/">GridCat</a></b>

If your site decides to become inactive for various reasons, e.g., site maintenance, the site administrator  should set the value of <i>grid_site_state_bit</i> to be other than 1. 

Example <a href="http://www.ivdgl.org/MIS-CI/grid-site-state-info">grid-site-state-info</a> file.

---++ Site Verification
---+++site-verify
Now you're ready to run the full CE site verification test suite. All elements of this test should now pass.

Note: To run the site verify script you should not be <b>root</b> .
<pre>
&gt;   cd $VDT_LOCATION
&gt;   source ./setup.sh
&gt;   grid-proxy-init 
     <i>....enter your passphrase</i>
&gt;   cd verify
&gt;   ./site_verify.pl 
</pre>
The results will indicate the various tests that are performed with results indicating  FAILED, UNTESTED,  NOT WORKING,  NONE or  NO. conditions.

---++ Authorizing Users: Operational Configuration
The earlier test case only authorized yourself as a local user.  You should now go to 
<a href="http://info.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/OsgCEAuthorization">
Osg CE Authorization</a> document and authorize other users before performing the
*OSG Registration* of your service (otherwise no one but you will be able to access it!).

---++ OSG Registration

To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu/][webform]] located under the OSG [[http://info.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Main/GridAdminstratorSupport][Administrator Support page]]. If you are registering into the OSG, be sure to check the appropriate box for which grid catalog you are registering with. You should receive an email response automatically back from the GOC to the operations contact you supplied. If this response doesn't arrive within a reasonable delay, please resubmit your registration.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a site to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make site and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.

---++Troubleshooting Guide
As you install, monitor the $VDT_LOCATION/vdt-install.log.  

   * If pacman tries to retrieve something from a website that's having problems, you'll get an error message that's unrelated to the real problem because pacman can't recognize 404 errors when downloading tarballs.  For example, when the PRIMA download site was down, it told us the file wasn't in the correct format:
<pre>
vdt-untar is untarring prima-0.3.x86_rh_9.tar.gz
gzip: stdin: not in gzip format 
</pre>
---++Shutdown Guide
