---++ RSV installation
The [[MonitoringInformation.RSV][OSG-RSV]] package (from now on, referred to simply as !RSV), by default, is installed along with the OSG CE but not fully configured. Additional configuration steps are necessary as documented below. 

There are separate instructions for installing RSV as a [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/InstallAndConfigureRsvAdvanced#Install_standalone_RSV_package_f][standalone Package]] on a separate machine or an existing CE/SE,

Starting with VDT 1.10.0 (OSG CE 1.0 and above), unless =VDTSETUP_NO_CONDOR_CRON= is set to =1=, !RSV will always include a minimal Condor package called condor-cron that is used to schedule !RSV probes and such.
