---++ Security, by Susan Sons
---+++ Vulnerabilities/Incidents since 15 Feb 2017:

   1. Reports of “drive-by” attacks on various open source products, including Hadoop.  Attackers were looking for unsecured HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) instances where they could perform unauthorized malicious activities, such as modify or delete all accessible data at the site. HDFS instances Hadoop installation. The announcement was forwarded to REN-ISAC members and EGI SVG prepared a security advisory based on OSG information.
