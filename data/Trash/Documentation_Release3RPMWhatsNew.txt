---+ What's different about the RPM-based OSG Software Stack?

%STARTINCLUDE%
Here are some key items to note about this release:
   * We have moved from Globus 4.0.8 to Globus 5.2. Globus 5.2 does not includes web-services GRAM (aka GRAM 4). GRAM from 5.2 should be compatible with the pre-web services GRAM from Globus 4.0.8.
   * If you use GUMS, you must make sure that you use version 1.3.x or later. This is because our authorization framework has been changed (we now use lcmaps instead of PRIMA), and it only uses the newer XACML protocol instead of the old SAML protocol. GUMS 1.2.x and earlier did not provide the XACML protocol.
   * Some components are not yet packaged as RPMs and you still need to get them from existing Pacman installs. In particular, GUMS and the Gratia Collector are not yet provided via RPM.
   * Files are installed in standard locations such as =/usr/bin= and =/etc=. Some implications of this:
      * =$VDT_LOCATION= no longer exists
      * =$VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh= no longer exists and isn't needed. For user jobs that still expect =setup.sh= to exist, a dummy has been placed in =/etc/osg/wn-client/setup.sh=, and you can set =$OSG_GRID= to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.
      * =$GLOBUS_LOCATION= no longer exists
   * The single =config.ini= file has been replaced by a directory of files in =/etc/osg/*.ini=. They are read in alphabetical order.
   * You will still use configure-osg for configuring your CE, but it doesn't do as much as it used to do. 
   * The recommended method for installing a worker node is to no longer install it on a shared filesystem, but to install it via RPMs on each node. While this is a better approach, when you install or upgrade hundreds or thousands of nodes at your site, you will potentially overload our software repository. We recommend mirroring our software repository ([[InstallBestPractices#Repository_Mirrors][instructions]]) or using a Squid proxy to lessen the load on our server.
   * =configure-osg= has been renamed to =osg-configure=
