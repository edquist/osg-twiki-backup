This document should note the big changes in RPMs. It's an essential document. I don't have time to write it now, but have a few thoughts that should be expounded on:

   * Moving from GT 4.0 to GT 5.2. No WS GRAM. GRAM from 5.2 should be compatible with GRAM from GT 4.
   * Authorization with GUMS will only use newer XACML protocol, not older SAML protocol. This means you need GUMS 1.3 (_double-check that version_) or later. Older versions of GUMS will not work. 
   * Some components are not yet packaged as RPMs and you still need to get them from existing Pacman installs. In particular: GUMS and Gratia Collector. 
   * Files are installed in standard locations such as =/usr/bin= and =/etc=. Some implications of this:
      * =$VDT_LOCATION= no longer exists
      * =$VDT_LICATION/setup.sh= no longer exists and isn't needed. For user jobs that still expect =setup.sh= to exist, a dummy has been placed in =/etc/osg/wn-client/setup.sh=, and you can set =$OSG_GRID= to =/etc/osg/wn-client=.
      * =$GLOBUS_LOCATION= no longer exists
   * The single =config.ini= file has been replaced by a directory of files in =/etc/osg/*.ini=. They are read in alphabetical order.
   * You will still use configure-osg for configuring your CE, but it doesn't do as much as it used to to.
