---%SHIFT%+ About the Virtual Organization Management Registration Service (VOMRS)

The [[http://www.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/index.html][Virtual Organization Management Registration Service (VOMRS)]] 
is compliant with OSG %LINK_GLOSSARY_VO% policy and offers a comprehensive set of services that facilitates secure 
and authenticated management of VO membership, grid resource
authorization and privileges:

   * Implements a registration workflow providing means for collaborators to register with a Virtual Organization (VO)
   * Supports management of multiple grid certificates per member
   * Permits VO-level control of member's privileges 
   * Provides email notifications of selected events
   * Keeps track of Grid and VO AUPs signed by members
   * Supports VO-level control over its trusted set of Certificate Authorities (CA)
   * Permits delegation of responsibilities within the various VO administrators
   * Manages groups and group roles
   * Is capable of interfacing to third-party systems and pulling or pushing relevant member information from/to them
   * Is synchronized with VOMS 

---%SHIFT%+ Components

VOMRS consists of three components: 

   1 !MySQL database which is a persistent repository for VO membership information, 
   1 VOMRS admin which provides the Web UI/services to maintain the VO membership. This requires Apache/Tomcat.
   1 VOMRS server, a daemon process which performs variety of tasks that include synchronization with VOMS, sending email notifications, managing Certificate Authorities certificates within VOMRS, etc.

Also included in the installation is a VOMRS soapclient that allows to execute any webservice supported by VOMRS for testing.

When you install VOMRS, you get all three parts.  VOMRS is synchronized with VOMS, so VOMS will be installed on your system as well. Please refer to [[VomsInstallGuide][VOMS Installation Guide]] for all issues related to VOMS.

VOMRS comes with a test VO called _VDT_. We suggest that you use it for testing. You're going to need to create your real VO with the appropriate name. Instructions for doing that are also on this page.
