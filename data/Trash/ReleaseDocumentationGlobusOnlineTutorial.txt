---++ Introduction
This hands-on tutorial, created for the 2011 OSG Summer Workshop, explains how to use Globus Online
to complete an example file transfer using the command line interface and the web interface.


---+++!!Engineering Considerations

You will need two endpoints to transfer files between.  At least one of them must be a gridFTP server that you have access to, either using x509 credentials or a MyProxy server.  The other can also be a gridFTP server, or it can be a "GlobusConnect" client running on your machine (e.g. your laptop).

---++ Checklist
Before this tutorial, you will need to sign up for a Globus Online account at:
https://www.globusonline.org/SignUp

An in-line numbered list of items assumed to have been already performed
E.g.:
   1. Installs that must be done before this one
   1. Security environment in place
   1. batch system in place
   1. stop existing service
   1. ports required

---++ First Time Install
A link to document containing information and install steps that only need to be performed if this a first time install.

---++ Installation Procedure
The description of the steps of this Install procedure (including the commands and options required) that will have to be performed each time this is installed.

Each step that requires commands should show the commands in a green box using 
<verbatim><pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre></verbatim> tag which will look like this.
<pre class="screen">
command parameters
</pre>
%BR%
%NOTE% Standard variables (such as $VDT_LOCATION) should be used where they exist
%NOTE% The terminal interaction must be verbatim with no extra characters so that a user can copy and paste the command lines.

This procedure covers the success legs only 

---++ Service Configuration/Startup/Shutdown
Description of the steps (including the commands/options) to startup and shutdown the service.
This often requires, the reader to edit lines in a config file.
If this is necessary, put the lines in a screen box with a yellow background 
(to distinguish from entering commands (green box).
<pre class="file">
Config file line a
Config file line b
</pre>

---++ Validation of Service Operation
Commands to be used to verify the service is working correctly.  This can be combined with the previous section if they are both short.

#DebugInfo
---++ Debugging Information
---+++!!File Locations
Locations of configuration files, input/output files, log files, etc. that are important for an administrator to know about if something doesn't work.  

---+++!!Debugging Procedure
What are the first things to check, step-by-step instructions to determine source of problem for this service

---+++!!Caveats/Known Issues
Restrictions and/or work around for known issues 

---+++!!References
