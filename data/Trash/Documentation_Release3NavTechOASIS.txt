---+!! OSG Application Software Installation Service

%TOC%

---+ Introduction

OASIS is the OSG Application Software Installation Service. It is the recommended method to install software on the Open Science Grid. It is implemented using !CernVM !FileSystem (CVMFS) technology.   The client portion is the CVMFS client combined with an OSG configuration.  The server portion has three ways to install software: through OSG Connect for small projects,  in the OSG-hosted oasis.opensciencegrid.org CVMFS repository for small independent Virtual Organizations (VOs), or in self-hosted CVMFS repositories for larger VOs.
