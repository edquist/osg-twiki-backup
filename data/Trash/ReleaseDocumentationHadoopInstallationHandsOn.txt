---++Introduction
This tutorial covers the installation of a SE based on Hadoop and Bestman Gateway.  At the end of this tutorial you will be able to use srm to copy files into and out of the SE, access files through a local filesystem mount, and know how to add more storage space to Hadoop.

---++Requirements

The participants will need to have a minimum of two servers and root access on both servers. Both servers should have a single public IP address. Both servers must have the fuse kernel module and fuse userspace packages installed. Both servers must have Sun Java 1.6 installed. A working gums service is required for user mappings; grid-mapfile mappings are not currently supported. One server will run the Hadoop NameNode, Bestman, and Gridftp processes. The BestMan+GridFTP server must have at least 4GB of memory and a valid host or service certificate installed in /etc/grid-security/{hostcert.pem,hostkey.pem} (for gridftp) and /etc/grid-security/http/{httpcert.pem,httpkey.pem} (for BestMan). 

---++More Information

---++Commands

Install Hadoop on both the Namenode and datanode with the same commands:

<pre class="screen">
rpm -ivh http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/osg-hadoop-1-2.el5.noarch.rpm
yum install hadoop
</pre>

Configure Hadoop on the Namenode by editting =/etc/sysconfig/hadoop=.  Configure Hadoop on the Datanode by editting =/etc/sysconfig/hadoop=.  Start Hadoop on the namenode first, then on the datanode second using the same set of commands on each:

<pre class="screen">
service hadoop-firstboot start
chkconfig hadoop on
service hadoop start
</pre>

Install GridFTP on the Namenode (TBD)

Install BestMan SRM on the Namenode (TBD)
