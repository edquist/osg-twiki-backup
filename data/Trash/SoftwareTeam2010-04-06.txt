---+ Meeting between Executive Team and OSG Software Coordinator, 7-April-2011

---++ Questions for the Executive Team 

   1. *Should we drop dCache packaging?* A few weeks ago, Tanya and I proposed that we should no longer provide VDT-specific packaging and configuration for major new versions of dCache. We're interested in your feedback. What do you think? Do you need more information from us? (A replica of our email to the ET is below.)
   1. We would like to change our approach to packaging software. Our proposal is connected to our native packaging efforts. Our question: is this a good enough idea that we should flesh out our proposal? [[PassThroughPackaging][Proposal for pass-through packaging]]

---++ Information for the Executive Team

   1. *Team Meetings*: We have instituted whole-team meetings of the OSG Software Team. Previously we had separate meetings for UW-Madison folk and storage folk. They are every other week, with the smaller meetings happening on off-weeks. [[Meetings][Meeting Minutes]]
   1. *Worker Nodes*: We have completed an initial version of the worker node packed as binary RPM. Last week it went to a few friendly testers and we have started to get some feedback from them. It appears to work correctly, but at least one site (Nebraska) can't use it as long it's incompatible with EPEL. [[WorkerNode][Worker Node plan]]
   1. *Xrootd*: With ATLAS representatives (Michael Ernst, Doug Benjamin, Rob Gardner) we have agreed on the [[XrootdRPMPhase1Reqs?rev=12][initial requirements for the Xrootd RPM]]. We have a "pass-through" RPM (see above) that implements most of their requirements, and we are working on the last details.
   1. State of !CREAM
   1. *GUMS*: John Hover _almost_ had a new developer to work on GUMS, but at the very last minute the developer declined the job. John has gotten up to speed on development and expect to give the VDT a new version this week. It's unclear if this is a long-term sustainable development plan (John is very busy), but for the moment we're okay. 
   1. *Effort*: We've been tracking effort in the VDT. We now have a spreadsheet that shows recent effort from everyone in the software team and some rough estimates for where effort will be spent in April and May. %WILL BE ATTACHED HERE SOON%

---++ Extra Background

Subject: Request for feedback: drop dCache packaging

Hello,

For the last few years, the OSG Software Team has been repackaging
dCache for consumption by OSG users. We've got a distribution that
includes:

1. dCache RPMs
2. Extra software dCache uses (such as the postgresql database)
3. Custom configuration scripts we created to simplify the
installation and configuration of dCache.
4. Gratia transfer and storage probe RPMs, which we developed and
maintain
5. Community toolchest RPMs

We would like to propose that we no longer continue making or
distributing #1 - #3 for new major versions of dCache. We will
continue to provide gratia probes and community toolchest RPMs (#4 &
#5).

Our question for you: do you agree?

We propose this for two reasons:

A) Updates to major new versions (one of which is due this April) are
considerable effort.
B) According to our survey of OSG sites, almost no one in OSG uses
this packaging any more. We believe that our efforts to repackage
dCache provide a diminishing value and our effort is better spent
elsewhere.

What does "almost no one mean"? More precisely: 13 OSG sites use
dCache, and only 3 of them (UERJ, AGLT2, and IllinoisHEP) use the VDT
dCache installation.

We haven't contacted these three sites yet to see how inconvenient
this proposal is. We first want your approval that we are considering
the right general direction. If you agree, we'll work with the sites
to see how burdensome the transition is, and if we can help them with
it.

Thanks!
Alain & Tanya
