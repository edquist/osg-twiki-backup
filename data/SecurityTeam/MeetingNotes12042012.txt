---++Meeting Notes
*Kevin*
   * Fermilab PKI took up a lot of time. This needs to be restricted. 
   * Pakiti testing. They put in the changes that Kevin requested. They will be ready to put into production release which is due on Dec 7th. Kevin is confident that this can be doen by the due date. 
   * No progress on JIRA 38 
   * No progress on CIlogon basic ca accetance at gridunesp and uflorida. 


*Anand*
   * Condor vulnerability. Anand will open the tickets with sites. High priority
   * CILogon Basic CA testing. Kevin's initial test failed. OIM, myosg, twiki, ticket. We will first test the services that do not require authorization but only requires authentication. Then we will test the services that require authorization by registering our CIlogonBasic CA in our OIM accounts. Anand will set up a meeting with Scott. High priority
   * Debian package for CIlogon is released to ITB. 
   * IGTF release for ITB is made yesterday. 
   * Dhiva will send us the Esnet CA with sha-1. Dhiva plans to finish this by the end of this week. Medium priority
   * GlideinWMS drill. The difficulty is to find a front end that we can access. Marco says OSG front end is down right now, and we should wait for a one or more weeks. If Marco does not bring the front end up, then we will go to CMS.
