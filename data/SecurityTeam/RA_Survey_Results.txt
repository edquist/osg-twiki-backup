---++ The results of DOEGrids CA RA Agents survey on certificate request interface
Mine, Anand, and Doug
Meeting on 4/29/2010

Kent thinks making the interface better is important. We should keep in mind that as Warren says LIGO is currently using the script interface and they will switch to their own CA soon. 


We all agree that adding sponsor information is necessary and requested by VOs. However, we are not sure about how high priority that is. Anand thinks working with new openCA code is a top priority. 

8.0 is released and stable. Is this open source? we need to get it from Dhiva. Esnet gets license from RedHat. 

What is the work related to new version: redhat used to have a software development kit on their web site. no kit is provided anymore for v8. No documentation for development. the current DOEGrids implementation has been customized and needs some coding. 

Registration Manager can be deployed separately. Dhiva can download the rpms and make it available to Anand.  

why do we need development? 
current doegrids registration manager has a lot of customized changes to it. No RA information, sponsor, PI or VO information is kept in the plain vanilla registration manager. 

Doug thinks we should get our hands on the new version. we need to get people directed to this new service. mine thinks we can do the direction in two ways by asking VOs to change their own documentation and by changing OSG documentation. 

can Doug change the name of pki1.doegrids.org. that is ambigous name

Can OSG separately run a registration manager for the new version. We can run a separate registration manager for 8.0 and 7.1. 

Registration Manager: does it only do the user interface? we do not understand if it also do the back end data storage. CA may be storing only the requests? 

When is the switch to new CA software will take place? Doug says in a few month.  Data migration is the challenging part. To overcome this, can we keep the old CA in a limited operational status (no request and approval, but only storage functions available) and do not do data migration? CRL generation would be the problem. 

If we do the new website and work on Registration Manager, we are adopting a web based solution. The new web site does not solve the browser certificate management issue. For that we may need a software script such as jGridStart. 

Doug thinks solving the browser problem is a challenging problem. He thinks why not we use two separate certificates: one for the browser, one for the grid jobs. The web browser certificate will be obtained from the CA as usual, and the grid job certificate will be obtained on the command line from MyProxy. Anand points that because short lived proxies cannot work for the web authentication (constant renewal will impede user's workflow and proxies are not recognized by default ssl authentication), we should use the long termed certificate in the browser. Mine does not like the idea that these are two separate certificates. This is more burden on the user. It may work if the CA can directly send teh certificate to the Myproxy but this would not work it needs private key to be transferred as well. 
  
On the other hand many VOs, like CMS has already done, are contemplating using the openID for the web.  

Mine is worried that waiting until we understand the Registration Manager will take more than a few months for us and for DOEgrids. I would like to have small but useful changes in the meantime. Can we make incremental changes. 

Anand will work on getting the sponsor list on the web site. He will incorporate this on the new web site. This should be easy to do for the next week. After we do this step we will announce it on our documentation and on VO documentations. if the web site location is changed once we merge with registration manager we will update these documentations.
