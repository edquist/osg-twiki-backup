---++ Meeting Notes 

*Kevin*
   * Got a java vulnerability that affects the browser in a high criticality manner. We reviewed this earlier and decided ot to make an annoucement because this affects browser only. java 1.60 sun compat is available in rpm. We should ask for an immediate patch. Kevin should clarify with software team why we distribute java rpms in VDT. Kevin will classify and request a patching schedule. 
   * Finished the condor script to find out vulnerable sites. Ran it against the gatekeepers that were discoverable. Could not run against everyone. only 15 sites, 2-3 came as vulnerable. the rest came as vulnerable. There is a problem of pending jobs. 
   * Pakiti. The project plan is at https://opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Security/PakitiSoftwareDistribution. Stage 1 is getting close to completion. Some delays in the overall timelines. Stage 1 and Stage 2 is progressing concurrently and will be completed in 2 weeks. Action Item: Kevin will adjust the current plan to fit into our project plan templates. 
   * EGI/OSG Drill. The complete grading of OSG sites will be completed by tomorrow. Action Item: There is a call coming up to start grading work. 

*Anand*
   * SHA-Transition project. Obtained the CRL file signed by SHA-2. It did not work with openssl 0.9.7.8. on SL4.8. Action Item: Find out which openssl version started supporting SHA-2. Kevin thinks scientific 5 has openssl 0.9.8. Action Item: find a SL5 and do the CRL testing again. Action Item;  Find out how many sites are using <SL5. Ask Production team for OSG sites to upgrade to SL5. Inform the production team about the transition problem of SL4. 
   *  Phase out of the Old Layout. Action Item: Will provide the project plan on twiki. 
   * CA update process. Communicated the security team's choice to Marco and Tim. The choice is implementing simple cron jobs that can update the CRLs. 
   * New IGTF release is coming up. OSG is running a version behind because we did not have the CA update process in place. Marco alreday made the RSV probe update 1.5 months ago. So sites have 8 days of grace period to update manually. Action Item: Ask software team and production team whether we should hold back the release. how widely RSV probe is deployed and when software team can deploy the CA. The UK Escience is expiring October 30 2012. security team has to make the release. 
   * Kevin will submit the ST&E results on docdb and the twiki page for ST&E 2011. Anand will review the findings from the document and start apropriate work.
