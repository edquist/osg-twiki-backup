   * Announcement to OSG community regarding TLS/SSL filtering issues triggered by well-known IPSs as TippingPoint and Fortios. A couple of OSG sites have reported having handshake timeouts in file transfers due to network blocking triggered by these IPSs. According to the reports received from the sites, a new filter targeting a vulnerability in a library called GnuTLS, is flagging all TLS connections that involve a grid proxy (RFC3820).

   * The security patch for VOMS-admin was postponed again (it was scheduled for May) and Susan wants to revisit this topic with the OSG Software team.

---++ New Business
   * WannaCry ransomeware targeting Microsoft Windows systems is over the news. It exploits a vulnerability MS17-010[20] in Microsoft's implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. There are worldwide reports and Europe has been affected widely. According to NCSA SecOps, here in the US the news of compromise across US research institutions and universities is particularly sparse.
      * As of 11:56 (eastern) IU University Information Security Office (UISO) says there are no reports of affected machines at IU. They will be conducting scans and will immediately block any machine found to be affected. OSGO has no MS machines running any service.
