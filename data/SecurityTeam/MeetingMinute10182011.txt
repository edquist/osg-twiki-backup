---++Meeting Minutes
 
Marko, Kevin, Anand, Igor, Mine

Anand:
-- Finished the security announcement about the CERN incident. Will send it out to the security contacts. No effects on osg yet. 
-- ca-certs rpm wipes the ca directory clean after each update. Anand will investigate why that is.  
-- We hear from EGI that worker nodes do not need certs. Anand will research how EGI security officers reach this decision and why they do not need host certs. 

-- the new ca layout in itb is the default layout. 

--Tickets: 
   * DOEGrids crl change request has been tested thoroughly in ITB. We can close the ticket.
   * Ian's feature request on ca-cert scripts
   * CRL rsv probes failing at GOC. Anand will investigate the root cause. 
   * Non-osg security contacts requested to receive osg security announcements #11038
   * We recently requested to include software developers on some security announcements. Opened a ticket at GOC to create a list of software developers and send them the related security announcements. 
 
Marko: 
-- Documentation for users on how to use certificates are up on the twiki and linked to documentation. 
-- Quiet on the grid-sec.
-- Fetch-crl 3.0 discussion. RPM for this version is already released. It is not default though. Steve Timm is the requestor and should be informed of the release.  
-- Today is Patch Tuesday at GOC. We have nothing to request. 


Kevin: 

-- Vulnerabilities: have not seen anything. no new vulnerabilities. 
-- Will work on creating an architecture of scientific linux packaging/distribution system.
