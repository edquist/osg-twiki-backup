---++ Meeting Minutes from week 10/13/2008

This week Doug is out with a hip surgery, Jim is traveling on Tuesday. So instead of a single meeting, we will have two meetings: one with Ron and one with Jim. 
---+++ Meeting with Jim Basney
   1 OSG RA work -- approval work is done by Jim. jeff porter is doing the technical work. 
   2 Von -- can find temp help to help with incident response work. 
   3 Eugridpma : CRL's has too short lifetimes. 3 days should be minimum lifetime. Maximum lifetime should be 30 days. NetTrust and CERN CAs are causing trouble with daily CRLs. in OSG we have Purdue CAs that also have too short CRLs.
   4 RSV CRL checks: Arvind has RSV probe issues. when rsv probe checks the versions: if the installed ca is form GOC, it returns a warning because latest version is recorded as from VDT. Arvind also does a more complicated RSV check than EGEE requested. EGEE only checks the timestamp of when site attempted the CRL download. if latest stamp is beyond 9 hours, egee issues a warning. If it is later than 3 days , egee gives a warning. Sites are exepcted to download crls every 6 hours. egee RSV probe does not check CRL expiration date.
   5 JSPG: infrastructure policy group will work with all peer grids and harmonize policies. this is not to replace JSPG. infrastructure group is not interested in writing policies. in JSPG: VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Registration and VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Memberships are discussed. Jim and I will do the prep work to familiarize VOs and everyone else with these requirements. 
   6 VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMRS support by OSG. Maria Dimo complains. VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS-admin does not do enough support due to lack of money. Mine asked Jim to email Gabrielle
   7 some VOs sent their policies to Doug from users meeting. 
   8 Incident closures on grid-ssh and any other open attacks. Jim will close them and write up a what we learned report. 

---+++ Meeting with Ron Cudzewicz
