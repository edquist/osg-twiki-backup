---++Meeting Notes
*Kevin*
   * Steve reported one of the hashes in the pacman release was wrong. Not sure how just one could be wrong, but will investigate this afternoon.
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * There is a new VO coming online. CTA. THis is an existing EGI VO, do we still do security training with them in this case? Do we want to modify any procedures in this  case? They do have members at SLAC as well as in France, I believe.
   * Will submit Certificate Free Submission newsletter article today.
   * According to Soichi perfSONAR is planned to be used for diagnosing network issues with sites. Will set up some test vms to try it out myself. 
   * Secunia sent an email saying they are going to change their mail list to a weekly digest format instead of as they come vulnerability emails, but so far I haven't seen a change. Has anyone else heard anything about this? Also noticed Fermilab's exchange server got me kicked off bugtraq a couple months ago without warning/notice. Might just have to subscribe from home...
