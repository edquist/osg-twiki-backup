---++Meeting Notes
*Kevin*
   * Steve reported one of the hashes in the pacman release was wrong. Not sure how just one could be wrong, but will investigate this afternoon.
   * Suggestions to improve the CA release. 
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Medium Priority. Start after January 1st.  There is a new VO coming online. CTA. THis is an existing EGI VO, do we still do security training with them in this case? Do we want to modify any procedures in this  case? They do have members at SLAC as well as in France, I believe. We will setup a meeting with the VO after the NewYear
   * Will submit Certificate Free Submission newsletter article today.
   * According to Soichi perfSONAR is planned to be used for diagnosing network issues with sites. Will set up some test vms to try it out myself. 
   * Secunia sent an email saying they are going to change their mail list to a weekly digest format instead of as they come vulnerability emails, but so far I haven't seen a change. Has anyone else heard anything about this? Also noticed Fermilab's exchange server got me kicked off bugtraq a couple months ago without warning/notice. Might just have to subscribe from home...
   * High Priority. Start January 1st. Will evaluate security of perfSonar test box at GOC and the perfSonar dashboard. 
   * High Priority. Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0 after New Year.


*Anand*
   * High priority. Due End of January. GLOW VO evaluation. The issue is that there are multiple submit nodes that submits jobs to CHTC frontend. We do not understand the security between the submit nodes and the frontend. Moreover, some of the submit nodes are managed by CHTC and some managed by the PIs. We do not understand how a PI can guarantee traceability over his/her machine. CHTC will have no control over such machines. We need to evaluate this issues further. Will document our findings and we will conduct a security drill with CHTC to understand their traceability capabilities. 
   * High Priority. Awareness campaign to reduce the worker node certificates. Will write a newsletter article that has why some sites can eliminate having worker nodes certificates; how these sites can configure Glexec and GUMS to have secure connections. 


*Mine*
   * IOTA profile that allows CAs like CIlogon Basic CA to be accredited by IGTF is almost finalized. This opens up the door in WLCG for federations. The preGDB meeting reached a consensus that real names in certificates are nto necessary. As long as the certificates are unique and the VO does the identity vetting when the user joins VOMS, there is no need to have the user's real name in a certificate. Will participate into an experiment.
