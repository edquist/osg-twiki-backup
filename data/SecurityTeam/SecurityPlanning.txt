---++ Developing the Awareness and Training program
NIST SP800-50 elements to developing the program are
   * *Awareness and Training Program Design:* In this step, an agency wide needs assessment is conducted and a training strategy is developed and approved. This strategic planning document identifies implementation tasks to be performed in support of established agency security training goals.
   * *Awareness and Training Material Development:* This step focuses on available training sources, scope, content, and development of training material, including solicitation of contractor assistance if needed.
   * *Program Implementation:* This step addresses effective communication and roll out of the awareness and training program. It also addresses options for delivery of awareness and training material (web-based, distance learning, video, on-site, etc.).
   * *Post-Implementation:* This step gives guidance on keeping the program current and monitoring its effectiveness. Effective feedback methods are described (surveys, focus groups, benchmarking, etc.).

---+++ Program design
Program elements are described in the OSG Security Plan.  Materials are to be developed and acquired.
They will be presented at suitable OSG meetings (esp. the bi-annual All Hands Meetings) and will be available
online for self paced instruction.

Awareness and training materials are catgorized according to the role of the person receiving training.  In OSG, these roles are
   * Management
   * Security Team
   * OSG area coordinators (Facility, Software, Operations, Applications, Education, Engagement)
   * OSG core staff
   * VO administrators
   * Resource/site security contacts
   * Users
   * Other special roles
      * PKI registration agents


---+++ Material Development

Elements from Security Plan:
   * Integrated Computer Security Management - roles and responsibilities

   * Vulnerability Awareness (2.4.5.7)
