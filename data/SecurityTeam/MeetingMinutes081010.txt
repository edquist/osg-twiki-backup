*Anand*:

   * The cert request page should be hosted by GOC in two weeks. All technical decisions have been made.
   * Updated the CA rsv probe. This probe was constantly failing. this probe shows if we are in synch with IGTF distribution. We must tell GOC this is an important probe and they should upload fixed probe asap.

   * *Action item*: Doug will create a spreadsheet for certificate issuance workflow during the last month. We will go visit BNL about the Atlassecurity requirements for FY11. 
   * *Action Item*: Mine will start working with Jim to use CILogon in OSG. LBL IdP and Doegrid Idp are other good candidate IDPs to be tested with CILogon CA. 
   * new CILogon CA will be accredited according to silver profile. there are no silver IdPs in common. Unaccredited CILogon CA can be used, but that has to be used with manually accredited IdPs. Currently, the unaccredited CA also serves ProtectNetwork, which has no assurance. Jim has to separate the manually audited IdPs from the IdPs with no assurance.
