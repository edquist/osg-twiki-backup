---++ Input to OSG Management from Joint ESNET – OSG Identity Management Workshop
Mine Altunay, Doug Olson

The main report from the Joint ESNET – OSG Identity Management workshop is a joint document between the 2 organizations. The report includes findings and recommendations input to both organizations and to DOE ASCR on work that we recommend is done. This current document records those issues particular to the OSG and its’ planning. 

The agenda, submitted background material, presentations and capture of the white-boards are at OsgEsnetIdMgmtNov09 
Additions/Changes to the OSG Blueprint

---+++ Changes to OSG Blueprint

   * OSG will use the term Security Assertion when discussing requirements and concepts1. An X509 certificate is a particular implementation of a security assertion. 

   * Usability is an important goal of security in OSG. We will explore tying Usability and Security more closely to ensure better attention to the former in all matters. 

---+++Action Items for the Year 4 Program of Work
   1 Determine how to meet non-LHC VOs security needs. 
   
   * Isolate end user from X.509 details. 
   * Non-LHC VOs have multiple collaboration tools and like to manage access centrally. They do not want this to be X.509 based due to user aversion.  
   * Design first end-to-end security infrastructure for small, non-LHC VOs.
   

   1 Determine if we need revocation at the Authorization stage. 
     
   1 Document back up plan for distribution of trusted CA roots if Operations cache is compromised.
      * Work started. See [[ContingencyPlans][contingency plans]] under Security Team work area twiki
 
   * Clearly separate needs for “delegation” and “renewal”, the scenarios  and the functionality provided.

   * Is propagation of assertion equal to creating a new assertion?

   * Can we use credit cards in OSG. Create an exercise
      * Started an exercise. Find the document %RED%here.%ENDCOLOR%

   * Decide whether adoption of OCSP (online certificate status protocol)  would relieve us from the CRL problems. short CRL lifetimes causes authN failures. CRL is meant for an off-line system, yet too short lifespans turn them into on-line systems.
      * Work started. 
   * Analyse “wasted resources” due to certificate expiration and CRL issues 

   * Make user bootstrap quicker. Make decisions to “do whatever it takes” – put Usability first.
      * Assess how to provide “netidmgr” to the OSG community.

   * Document OSG proxy renewal recommendations and best practices. Does OSG sanction services performing proxy renewal? (Yes) How can OSG help and provide a proxy renewal service? 
      * Analyze end-to-end impact of proxy lifetime of 24hours. Implement possibility to apply this policy.
      * High priority. 

   * Enable small dynamic ad-hoc VO-groups
      * High priority
   * Obtain from VOs their 5 biggest risk scenarios.
      * In progress

   * Identify OSG iGTF liaison to ensure quick response to our community from iGTF and provide a mentor for OSG VO CA operators to work with iGTF.
       * In progress
   * Run security challenges for assertion revocation, CA compromise.

   * The challenge planned is DOEgrids compromise and having to revoke 3000 certs. Finding back up certs and identifying whom to issue certs first
   * Understand how group based storage access can be provided? Could dcache understand gid? Research dcache ACL. Have a blueprint discussion of data access and data group access management. Who are the experts?

   * who is auditing CA operators? How IGTF can be forced to ensure better CA operations? Who from OSG participate in IGTF incident response team. 

   * Do risk analysis of compromise of host or service security assertion and steps/timeline for revocation. 
      * Could revoking certs without verifying be a risk in itself
 
   * Analyse impact and response to VOMS compromise.

   * Analyse impact and response to Hadoop SE compromise.(Site issue only?)

   * Document checklist/procedure for data purging and archiving when VO or Site leaves the OSG. Analyse what happens to stored data when a site or VO leaves OSG?

   * Understand the cost of cleaning up an intrusion, how long it takes? 

   * Assess how Sites and VOs can continue in case of network disconnects.
   * How do pilots operate to gain fair-share?


---+++Action Items for the Year 5 Program of Work

   * Decide if OSG promote the idea of a US wide contract for Assertion issuance across all needs (X509, web, server, etc)? Is in-common planning to do this? Is it sufficient?

   * Document specific principles and policies for “named applications” running on OSG accessible resources. (e.g. Blast, Pilots). These do not need “special” user authentication and authorization.

   * Review risk assessment based on “insider” compromise.

   * How to achieve data and process privacy
