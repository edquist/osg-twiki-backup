An incident of a credential compromise was reported by CERN.  Full information below in security notification.

---++ Status

<!--
Suggested status labels:
NEW: Initial report is received but incident is not confirmed.  This is a triage phase.
OPEN: The existence of a security incident requiring response has been confirmed. The response is underway.
RESOLVED: The incident has been resolved but the final report has not been submitted.
CLOSED: The final report has been submitted.

   * *Status*: _current status (RESOLVED)_ 
   * *Lead*: _James J. Barlow <jbarlow@ncsa.illinois.edu>_
   * *Responders*: _list of involved responders (for resource tracking)_
   * *References*: _https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=9797_

<!--
_Optionally include additional status information here._
-->

---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: _Medium (see IncidentResponseProcess): The users grid credential was never used so only a medium severity._
   * *Urgency*: _Immediate (see IncidentResponseProcess): Since the users laptop was compromised, and a password was used at another site, immediate revocation of the users grid credential was needed._

<!--
_Add additional analytical details about the incident here, including an assessment of the risk, what assets are affected, etc._
-->

---++ Mitigation Plan

We will work this incident in two ways.  One we will work with the site where the user is located and the compromise occurred.  Second we will notify all OSG sites so that they can determine if the compromised credential was used at their site in the specified timeframe.

---+++ Actions to take

<LI>Create an OSG-SEC security announcement with details on what sites need to know.
<LI>Send announcement to all OSG security contacts.
<LI>Work with the local site of the user to get more details on the compromise.
<LI>Keep up with progress of the incident.

---+++ How to monitor progress

Incident lead is running all parts of this investigation.  We need to ensure that all of the action items above are completed.

---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

_Based on the risk assessment above, what response time is necessary and achievable?_

We can notify sites immediately with the information they need to know to check for use of a compromised credential.  The local site where the users machine was compromsied should be able to get back with us within a few days (less than a week) on what was discovered at their end.

---+++ List of affected parties

Current list of affected parties is just the individual who had their machine compromised.  If we have no sites reporting any activity with that users credential then we'll have to assume that none of the sites are affected.

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

This incident will be resolved once sites have been notified, none of these sites reports any activity, and the users system has been cleaned, patched, and put back into service.

OSG-SEC-2011-01-13 announcement:
<verbatim>
OSG Security Contacts,

The OSG Security Team wants to inform you of an instance of
credential compromise.  A users laptop was recently determined to
be compromised at an OSG site.  The users password was used to log
into a remote site and send SPAM.  You can check your local sites for
access from the IP address 141.211.98.52 or using the following DN:
/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Junjie Zhu 461501   The DN has been
revoked so make sure your CRL's have been updated.

Any questions or comments can be replied to this ticket:
