   * *DNS POC Contacting for host certificates:* By default !DigiCert sends email to DNS admin POC when a host certificate is requested. There is an assumption on !DigiCert's part that DNS admin POCs are authoritative for host certificate issuances. This needs to be resolved before we go into production.
   * *Identity vetting for re-key:* Reading http://www.digicert-grid.com/DigiCert_CP_v403.pdf, I'm concerned that Section 3.3.1 requires identity vetting for certificate re-key every 13 months rather than every 5 years as required by IGTF. Allowing annual certificate re-key without re-doing identity vetting is a current feature of the DOEGrids CA that is of great value to OSG. Our statistics indicate that it reduces our identity vetting load by 50% (i.e., 50% of current requests are handled by routine re-key without new identity vetting). Would you be willing to modify the CP to require re-verification on re-key "at least every five years" rather than the current requirement of "at least every 13 months"?
   * *Password authentication to [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/]]:* Both Jim and Mine had trouble getting https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/ to accept long passwords. Once resetting our account passwords to shorter values, we got in OK. Requires further investigation.
   * *How to revoke certificates via MPKI web interface?*
