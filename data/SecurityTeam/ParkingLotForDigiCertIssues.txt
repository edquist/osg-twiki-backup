   * *DNS POC Contacting for host certificates:* By default !DigiCert sends email to DNS admin POC when a host certificate is requested. There is an assumption on !DigiCert's part that DNS admin POCs are authoritative for host certificate issuances. This needs to be resolved before we go into production.
   * *Identity vetting for re-key:* Reading http://www.digicert-grid.com/DigiCert_CP_v403.pdf, I'm concerned that Section 3.3.1 requires identity vetting for certificate re-key every 13 months rather than every 5 years as required by IGTF. Allowing annual certificate re-key without re-doing identity vetting is a current feature of the DOEGrids CA that is of great value to OSG. Our statistics indicate that it reduces our identity vetting load by 50% (i.e., 50% of current requests are handled by routine re-key without new identity vetting). Would you be willing to modify the CP to require re-verification on re-key "at least every five years" rather than the current requirement of "at least every 13 months"?
   * *Password authentication to [[https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/]]:* Both Jim and Mine had trouble getting https://www.digicert.com/enterprise/ to accept long passwords. Once resetting our account passwords to shorter values, we got in OK. Requires further investigation.
   * *How to revoke certificates via MPKI web interface?:* This is resolved now?
   * *How to configure VOMS server with intermediate CA certificate:* Can we fix [[http://www.digicert.com/help/]] (The server is not sending the required intermediate certificate.) error with [[https://voms-itb.grid.iu.edu:8443/]]? It'd be useful if we decide to use a public root CA for VOMS servers, because then users won't need to manually install CA certificates in their browser to access the VOMS web interface.
   * *Entering new DNs of users into VOMS server* Tony Tiradani of CMS reported that changes in user DNs and their regsitration n VOMS had caused some issues in EGI. He thought the ticket https://ggus.eu/ws/ticket_info.php?ticket=77179 is a manifestation of this problem. We should investigate whether this would have any affect on our plans to change user DNs.
   * *Lack of random numbers trailing user CN* Tony Tiradani pointed that lack of random numbers trailing user CN which prevents name collisions may be a problem for DigiCert.   
   * *Issue multiple certificates for a user without revocation?* To support multiple certificates for user.
   * *Users email addresses should be associated with a university domain regsitered with DigiCert.* When obtaining certificates, users should provide email addresses which are associated with the university domains subscribed/registered with Digicert. There are two possible issue with this requirement:  Many of our users do not rely on their univ accounts for email. They move between instutions a lot and usually depend on a CERN or FNAL type email account. When users move, accounts get closed, and users never report the email change to the CA. The DOEgrids certs are good for 5-year renewal period -- and rarely a post-doc stays at a univ for 5 years. When their certificate renewal notifications go to the univ account which does not get checked  or closed, user ends up with an expired cert. To remedy this, OSG encouraged our users to provide the email account that they check the most for a long-time period. The second issue is that the employing university must have a contract with the DigiCert so that DogiCert can validate the user's email domain. This means every university/institution member of a VO has to accept this contract with DigiCert. This is a heavy burden on the universities especially considering this is only for end user certificates not the host certificates.
