---+++ Minutes
   * In principle it was agreed that it is sufficient to test the oldest and the latest version of production S/W especially GUMS, SEs, Condor
   * Dan asked about the lag between production testing and when the switch will take place. Does this mean we will have to test again?
      * Anand indicated that the new CA package will be continuously tested on ITB hence forth and any S/W that passed through ITB will be tested there. 
      * Suchandra will send out a list of what S/W are not being tested on ITB.
         * Initial list: VOMS, hadoop
   * Anand reported he communicated with David Groep, who has agreed to continue providing CA package in old format for a year.
   * We discussed the problem EGI experienced with VOMS
      * https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/index.php?78349
      * Alain will send an email to Andrea
         * From the email response it appears that all the earlier versions (< voms-admin 2.6) of voms-admin will be affected by the bug.
         * Need to discuss how it will impact our transition
   * Anand will send a follow up email to John Hover to get his feedback on how GUMS might be affected and what testing strategy he would recommend.
   * Anand will also follow up with Tanya on how changes will affect the SEs deployed on production.
