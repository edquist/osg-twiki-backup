---++CA Distribution Service Transition

---+++ Current Status as of 9/10/08

Security team: Finished creating the CA package and handed off to the GOC team. The steps for creating the package is listed [[CreatingCADistributions]]. The security team finished the process before 09/03/08

GOC: GOC has put a functional CA distribution service [[https://rt-svn.uits.indiana.edu/svn-web/osg/listing.php?repname=cadist&path=%2Ftrunk%2FCA-Certificates-Base%2Fcertificates%2F&rev=0&sc=0][at]]. This service works and has been finished before 9/3. (If Rob has the exact time please put it here)

VDT: There is a need for the software update to VDT 1.10 and VDT 1.8 . These issues will be discussed in below timeline

---+++ Timeline (including past steps)

PAST STEPS

| *Date* | * Status* | *Description* |  *Details* | 
| 8/18/2008 | Complete | VDT released the VDT 1.10.1g | VDT 1.10.1 is able to install certificates from a configurable location, which could be the GOC or the VDT or somewhere else. We'll just update vdt-update-certs to provide this functionality. The configuration file for vdt-update-certs will not have a location in it, and the script will default to the VDT convenience CA distribution. No change in default behavior for VDT users. Users still get the CA bundle when they install the VDT 1.10.1g.  The default location of the VDT CA service is contained in the vdt-update-cert script as well as vdt-update-cert.config file. (Why the hard-code needed in the script ????) |
|8/25/08| Complete | VDT released the VDT 1.8.1p | The same change as VDT 1.10.1g.  Backported a change to vdt-update-certs from VDT 1.10.1g: The CA certificate updater (vdt-update-certs) can now be configured to fetch CA certificates from other locations. This is to prepare for the OSG GOC hosting a CA certificate distribution. No change is expected in the default behavior.  |

THE FUTURE CHANGES

3. VDT new release for 1.10.1i on 9/11/2008 [Complete]

This release will not install certificates by default, and will require configuration to do so. vdt-update-certs will no longer have a default. However, the configuration file will have explanation on how to pick between GOC or VDT distribution services. The site admin has to uncomment one of the options and run the vdt-update script. 

There is NO changes to VDT CA distribution service. it has the same set of CAs as GOC does have. If a site cannot switch to GOC, they will fall back on VDT CA distr service.

4. VDT will write clear documentation for site admins. The current VDT pages has old info from last night 9/9 glitch. Mine asked Scot and Tim to remove those as it confuses sites. The configuration file and how it should be changed will be posted on VDT web site.  9/11/2008 [Complete]

5. When new 1.10 release is ready it will be tested by ITB sites. No VDT release will happen until we hear the software is working. This was done by the UW OSG-EDU site, Terrence Martin, and Steve Timm. 9/11/2008 [Complete] 

6. Suchandra will write documentation for OSG sites on twiki about how to make changes to the configuration file. 

7. OSG release???? I am asking this ? if the new VDT release means a new OSG release ? Rob/Suchandra please fill it in.

Who is repsonsible for OSG releases
 what happens to OSG sites who does not go to VDT directly for donwload and installation instructions. 

8. Security team will make sure that the list of CAs maintained at GOC and VDT is posted and clearly explained. The difference or future differences between two services must be very clear to users. Jim is responsible for this page. GOC and VDT links this page from security twiki pages

9. GOC makes the announcement on new OSG release and VDT makes the announcement on new VDT release

IMPORTANT: The CA packages at GOC and VDT are identical at this point. In both announcement, we state there is a grace period (of two weeks) for sites to select a CA service and configure it. At the end of grace period, VDT CA bundle only contain IGTF CAs. If a site has not made the transition then, they will NOT operate. Announcement should make it clear after the garce period, VDT is out of CA distribution business and only provides basic convenience service 

10. During the grace period, GOC and security team will examine how many sites made a choice and can switch between GOC and VDT if they choose to. If the transition is problematic, we will extend the grace period of two weeks and keep VDT CA service as it is before (containing all CAs)

11. The all of the future steps will have to be repeated for the VDT 1.8. 

IMPORTANT: VDT 1.8 and VDT 1.10 all refers to the same VDT CA distribution service. If the grace period for VDT 1.10 expires before all VDT 1.8 sites had a chance to switch to GOC, It is a PROBLEM. VDT 1.8 sites will stop working because VDT CA distribution will only have IGTF CAs. Alain and VDT team has to make sure grace period of VDT 1.10 covers grace period of VDT 1.8. (OR VDT can provide two separate CA distribution services one for VDT 1.8 and one for 1.10.  I do not think it is a good idea though. essentialy we are increasing the grace period for vdt 1.10 no matter what.)

12. Grace period for VDT 1.10 and 1.8 expires. VDT only provides IGTF CAs. GOC provides all OSG recognized CAs. 

13. After a while, VDT completely gets out of CA distribution business and only refers their users to fetch from IGTF distribution location. 

In the meantime. Tomorrow is the site admin meeting and I asked Doulg Olson to invite and train sites. tell them all about the changes happening. Security team will hold weekly meeting with site amdins and explain all the changes.
