---++CA Distribution Service Transition

Security team: Finished creating the CA package and handed off to the GOC team. The steps for creating the package is listed [[CreatingCADistributions]]. The security team finished the process before 09/03/08

GOC: GOC has put a functional CA distribution service [[https://rt-svn.uits.indiana.edu/svn-web/osg/listing.php?repname=cadist&path=%2Ftrunk%2FCA-Certificates-Base%2Fcertificates%2F&rev=0&sc=0][at]]. This service works and has been finished before 9/3. (If Rob has the exact time please put it here)

VDT: All software releases have been done. RSV fix is planned to be released tomorrow (9/18)
---+++ Timeline 


| *Date* | * Status* | *Description* |  *Details* | 
| 8/18/2008 | Complete | VDT released the VDT 1.10.1g | VDT 1.10.1 is able to install certificates from a configurable location, which could be the GOC or the VDT or somewhere else. We'll just update vdt-update-certs to provide this functionality. The configuration file for vdt-update-certs will not have a location in it, and the script will default to the VDT convenience CA distribution. No change in default behavior for VDT users. Users still get the CA bundle when they install the VDT 1.10.1g.  The default location of the VDT CA service is contained in the vdt-update-cert script as well as vdt-update-cert.config file. (Why the hard-code needed in the script ????) |
|8/25/08| Complete | VDT released the VDT 1.8.1p | The same change as VDT 1.10.1g.  Backported a change to vdt-update-certs from VDT 1.10.1g: The CA certificate updater (vdt-update-certs) can now be configured to fetch CA certificates from other locations. This is to prepare for the OSG GOC hosting a CA certificate distribution. No change is expected in the default behavior.|
|9/9/08|Complete|VDT released VDT 1.8.1q| This software allows configuring which CA distribution is used. The default is VDT convenience service. The CAs are coming with the default VDT installation|
|9/11/2008| Complete | VDT software release for 1.10.1i. No announcement on this date | This release will not install certificates by default, and will require configuration to do so. vdt-update-certs will no longer have a default. However, the configuration file will have explanation on how to pick between GOC or VDT distribution services. The site admin has to un-comment one of the options and run the vdt-update script. There is NO changes to the content of the VDT CA distribution service. it has the same set of CAs as GOC does have. If a site cannot switch to GOC, they will fall back on VDT CA distr service. In order to let everyone try out the new vdt-update-certs.config file, VDT created a new location for the CA distribution service. This will hopefully force the VDT customers (especially non-OSG customers) to pay attention to the configuration file. IN the meantime, the old location for the VDT CA distribution service is still maintained and alive. It will be turned off after the grace period.| 
|9/12/2008|Complete|VDT will write clear documentation for site admins| |
|9/11/2008|Complete|ITB testing. No VDT release or announcement will happen until we hear the software is working.| This was done by the UW OSG-EDU site, Terrence Martin, and Steve Timm. %BLUE% D.O. - Where are the results documented? Does it include <tt>pacman -get</tt> for both VDT 1.8.1 and VDT 1.10.1 as well as <tt>pacman -update</tt> of OSG 1.0, 0.8 and 0.6 (to be sure 0.6 is not yet broken)? %ENDCOLOR% (MineAltunay) It does not include VDT 0.6 as 0.6 is not supported. pacman -update and pacman -get are both tested successfully.| 
|9/12/2008|Complete|VDT sent announcement to site admins.| No changes necessary yet for RPMs. VDT still provides all RPM in YUM|
|9/16/2008|Complete|Rob wrote documentation for OSG sites on twiki. There is no OSG equivalent software release.|https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/ComputeElementPostInstal. %BLUE% D.O. if I have installed something like <tt>pacman -get OSG:ce</tt> or <tt>pacman -get OSG:client </tt> and then later do a <tt>pacman -update-check</tt> and am told there are updates available, that means there has been a new OSG release. %ENDCOLOR%|
|9/16/2008|Complete|Security team will make sure that the list of CAs maintained at GOC and VDT is posted and clearly explained. The difference or future differences between two services must be very clear to users. Jim is responsible for this page. GOC and VDT links this page from security twiki pages|https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CADistribution.| 
|9/16/2008|Complete|Jim sent the RPMs again to Rob Q| |
|9/22/2008|%RED%Incomplete%ENDCOLOR%|GOC hosting a Yum service for RPMs. %BLUE% D.O. - I see an rpm in the svn repository https://osg-svn.rtinfo.indiana.edu/cadist/tags/osg-certificates-1.0-igtf-1.24/CA-Certificates-Base/rpm/RPMS/noarch built. (Rob Q) YUM repository will be ready by the end of 9/17/08%ENDCOLOR%|
|9/19/2008|%RED%Incomplete%ENDCOLOR%|Arvind made a minor change to changes.txt file in the CA bundle (the tarball distributed by GOC CA service). Arvind cannot create a new tarball because he cannot sign the tarbal with security team's signature. Jim should sign it when he comes back.| |
|9/15/2008|Complete|GOC makes the announcement on new OSG release and VDT makes the announcement on new VDT release|%RED%The CA packages at GOC and VDT are identical at this point. In both announcement, we state there is a grace period (of two weeks) for sites to select a CA service and configure it. At the end of grace period, VDT CA bundle only contain IGTF CAs. If a site has not made the transition then, they will NOT operate. Announcement should make it clear after the grace period, VDT is out of CA distribution business and only provides basic convenience service%ENDCOLOR%| 
| 9/30/2008 | In Progress | http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/69345/osg-vo-ca-survey <br> http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/69947/osg-sites-ca-survey | CA transition survey<br>[[%ATTACHURL%/vo-survey-sum-080930.pdf][vo-survey-sum-080930.pdf]]: VO Survey Status 30Sep08<br>[[%ATTACHURL%/vo-survey-080930.pdf][vo-survey-080930.pdf]]: VO Survey Report 30Sep08<br>[[%ATTACHURL%/site-survey-sum-080930.pdf][site-survey-sum-080930.pdf]]: Site Survey Status 30Sep08<br>[[%ATTACHURL%/site-survey-080930.pdf][site-survey-080930.pdf]]: Site Survey Report 30Sep08 |
|10/15/2008|%RED%Incomplete%ENDCOLOR%|During the grace period, GOC and security team will examine how many sites made a choice and can switch between GOC and VDT if they choose to. If the transition is problematic, we will extend the grace period of two weeks and keep VDT CA service as it is before (containing all CAs)| |
|10/15/2008|%RED%Incomplete%ENDCOLOR%|Grace period for VDT 1.10 and 1.8 expires. VDT only provides IGTF CAs. GOC provides all OSG recognized CAs. | | 
|4/31/2009|Incomplete|VDT completely gets out of CA distribution business and only refers their users to fetch from IGTF distribution location| |
