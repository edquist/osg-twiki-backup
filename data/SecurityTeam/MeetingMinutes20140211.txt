   * Couple tickets opened about getting GridAdmins to include VO in certificate requests. Fermilab GridAdmins are now properly assigned VOs in OIM. Sent reminder emails to include VO in requests. Apparently that doesn't actually work. Will keep an eye on related tickets.
   * New CA bundles released.
   * Updating the CA package to the new layout. Horst is investigating for DOSAR. Been mentioning at meetings. Will send reminder email this week to sites to double check that they are using new format bundles.
   * Work on cvmfs templates for Jose this week.
   * When Perfsonar releases an update, we will send a reminder to our sites. 
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Will evaluate security of perfSonar test box at GOC and the perfSonar dashboard. Downloaded live image, need to try it out.
   * Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0.
