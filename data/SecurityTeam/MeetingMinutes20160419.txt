---+ OSG Security Team Meetings

   * Phone: 866-740-1260 ID 3297985

   * DCAFI CHEP abstract not accepted by Fermilab
   * Discovered that CILogon Basic CA is not accepted in Europe.  Discussing with Jim Basney, Irwin Gaines.  Europe has added software to allow accepting a list of VOs with it, but as I understand it they require the VOs to do strong identity vetting, including face-to-face meetings showing government photo-ID.  This is too onerous for the way we do things in the U.S.  I'm inquiring why it isn't enough to do the less strict level used by the KCA, which is accepted in Europe.  That level only requires a documented process for doing validation.
   * What's the status of an OASIS security drill?
   * Posted new OSG CA specification revision adding E-mail Protection flag on April 13 to the tagpma-general google group.  Need to allow 2 weeks for comment, then CILogon can make the change.

   * OSG CA Transition
      * Transition scheduled for April went OK. Vo-client v65 was released on time and there are no issues reported so far.
      * SCDA was pushed to May.
      * Transition for VOs scheduled for May 10th: NERSC, SURAGrid, DREAM, LBNL, CompBioGrid??, LQCD, BNL, LZ, CIGI, SCDA.
      * Fix for Atlas issue still pending for testing [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/OSGPKI-399][JIRA ticket]]
      * Issue with host certificate request including many Alternate names. CILogon was enforcing a maximum length of 255 characters on the list of alt hostnames. Fix has been deployed in CILogon test endpoint, waiting for testing. Details at [[https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/29375][OIM ticket]]
   * Operations
      * The CRL errors with SDG-G2 were related to the previous IGTF release and was solved with the new release on April 12th. It seems the error was transient.
      * No new vulnerabilities affecting OSG
      * Corrections were included in the SLA between XSEDE and OSG for CILogon Service. Waiting for comments from Rob Q.
      * OSG announcement was sent to inform the users that CILogon certificates cannot be used for email signing. 
   * DCAFI
      * Met with Jim Basney last week to discuss about the MOU and the SLA between XSEDE and Fermilab for the CILogon Basic CA. Working on the draft.
      * Working on the SLA and the OLA for MyProxy.
   * Fermilab Security
      * Presented at CS Liaisons the Security guidelines for experiments. Testing possible implementations.
      * Working with Gene Oleynik as part of a working team to produce recommendations for Fermilab's storage future plans.
      * Working on paper proposals regarding innovative authentication and access control mechanisms for the Grid.
      * Attended the IIT ForenSecure'16 last week. Some interesting technical conferences about CSIR and discussions about IoT. 

---++ Anand
   * Developing a plan for an OSG Security Drill targeting OSG sites. See https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityDrillMay2016 for initial thoughts. Will identify 10 sites in the next few weeks.
