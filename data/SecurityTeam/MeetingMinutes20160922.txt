   * cigetcert 1.7 released including all the responses to the code review plus support for Debian.  cigetcert 1.8 adds support for VOMS proxies.  Installed as test version on el5 & el6 Fermilab ups area.  Very soon I will be adding support for $X509_USER_PROXY
   * An [[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/issues/13872][agreement]] was reached for both jobsub_submit and ifdh to share grid proxies in the standard location ${X509_USER_PROXY:-/tmp/x509up_`id -u`}
   * New jobsub version is adding cigetcert -n option and telling the user how to run cigetcert if it fails; jobsub used to do that but recent versions had dropped it.
   * Began discussion with FIFE support group about the documentation to help them help users with jobsub submission authorization errors.
   * Rescheduling Steve Tuecke for November after he had to cancel for this week
   * Need to upload draft of CHEP poster on cigetcert/DCAFI by a week from Monday, October 3; the deadline was pushed back a week.  The first draft was done, but Jeny is now improving it based on feedback.
