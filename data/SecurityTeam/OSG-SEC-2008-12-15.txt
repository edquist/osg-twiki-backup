---+ OSG-SEC-2008-12-15

The [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/glexec.html][glexec]] configuration distributed with VDT does not validate the proxy it was given.
This could potentially allow an attacker to change to any other UID (but not root) once on the worker node.
In our analysis, the vulnerability is exploitable only by locally authenticated users who can submit jobs to worker nodes.

---+++ How to monitor progress

To verify that the proxy is being validated, by forcing a failure:<br>
Remove the CA cert from the trusted certificates area and
perform the usual gLExec tests
(http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGlexecInstall#Testing_gLexec)
and glexec should fail.<br>
For example, if using DOEGrids certificates, the procedure is as follows:
<verbatim>
cd /etc/grid-security/certificates
mkdir a
mv 1c3* a/
(perform the glexec test -> must fail)
(finally move back the DOEGrids CA cert back in place (and optionally retest with success)) 
</verbatim>

Glexec logs can be monitored for suspicious activity. For details, see:
http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGlexecInstall#About_the_gLexec_log_files

---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

A VDT update is expected by Fri Dec 19. Update released Fri Dec 19.

---+++ List of affected parties

This issue only affects OSG deployments (the bug is specific to the OSG glexec deployment) and then only a subset of it.
FNAL and UCSD use glexec. BNL uses it too.

We estimate 10 USCMS sites are affected.
Response should be coordinated with Burt and Kent from USCMS.

For USATLAS sites, only BNL and SLAC have gLexec installed.
Notify Xin Zhao <xzhao@bnl.gov>.

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

End of event occurs when a fix is released by VDT.

---+++ 15-Dec-2008: Initial Report
<verbatim>
Subject: glexec security problem
Date: Mon, 15 Dec 2008 16:27:25 -0600
From: Sfiligoi Igor <sfiligoi@fnal.gov>

Hi all.

We just found out that glexec configuration distributed with VDT is
wrong and does not validate the proxy it is given.
This could potentially lead to an attacker to change to any other UID
(but not root) once on the worker node.

The error is in the LCMAPS configuration file
/etc/glexec/lcmaps/lcmaps-suexec.db

The current one (in VDT is)
------------------------
path = MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/MAGIC_VDT_LIB/modules

good = "lcmaps_dummy_good.mod"
bad  = "lcmaps_dummy_bad.mod"

gums = "lcmaps_gums.mod -exec
MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping"

glexec_get_account:
gums -> good | bad
------------------------

instead, it should be
------------------------
path = MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/MAGIC_VDT_LIB/modules

good = "lcmaps_dummy_good.mod"
bad  = "lcmaps_dummy_bad.mod"

gums = "lcmaps_gums.mod -exec
MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping"

verifyproxy = "lcmaps_verify_proxy.mod"
           "--allow-limited-proxy"
           " -certdir /etc/grid-security/certificates"

glexec_get_account:
verifyproxy -> gums
------------------------
PS: This assumes the CA certificates are in /etc/grid-security/certificates.

---+++ 16-Dec-2008: Phone Conference
Attending: Jim, Aashish, Gabriele, Igor, Alain<br>
Summary: glexec security flaw can be fixed by editing config file.
Affects VDT 1.8 and 1.10 -- same fix applies to both.<br>
How much effort to fix? Half a day to issue VDT update.<br>
glexec update planned for middle to end of February. new config. new binary.<br>
10 sites affected? 4-5 tier2 cms sites installed and configured. notify Burt and Kent (USCMS).<br>
goal: prevent deploying new version of glexec with this problem.
just as easy to fix as it is to disable.<br>
Igor and Gabriele around until end of week.<br>
Scott and Igor will work to release new glexec this week.<br>
Just update VDT 1.10. Provide manual instructions for 1.8.<br>

---+++ 18-Dec-2008: !CentOS5/SL5 Issue
<verbatim>
Subject: Re: glexec security problem
Date: Thu, 18 Dec 2008 11:37:53 -0600
From: Sfiligoi Igor <sfiligoi@fnal.gov>

Hi All.

Further tests on glexec show that the new configuration solves the
problem on SL4 (32 and 64bit), but does not work on CentOS5/SL5.
The verify_proxy plugin returns a strange error what neither myself nor
the glexec/lcas developers understand.

Unfortunately, it is unlikely that this will be solved before mid
January; most people involved are on vacation starting end of tomorrow.
Plus, sl5 is not really supported by EGEE so we were the only ones that
were supposed to be using it (and testing it).

At this point, I suggest we drop support for anything but rhel4/sl4 for
gLExec in VDT 1.10.1.
Burt confirmed CMS does not use it on anything else right now, and my
guess is that nobody else uses it on SL5 either.

Please let me know ASAP what do you think about this.

---+++ 5-Jan-2009: FermiGrid Update
<verbatim>
Subject: Re: glexec security problem
Date: Mon, 05 Jan 2009 15:01:27 -0600
From: Keith Chadwick <chadwick@fnal.gov>
To: Jim Basney <jbasney@NCSA.UIUC.EDU>, SECURITY-DISCUSS-L@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG

FermiGrid has not deployed the fix.  We do not expect to deploy the
fix until scheduled downtimes following availability of the SL5 fix.

On the other hand, the FermiGrid Site Authorization Service (SAZ) service,
which is deployed on the worker nodes that have gLExec installed, does
validate the proxy, and it is are belief that this would prevent this exploit.

---+++ 22-Jan-2009: Fix in VDT test cache

A new package 

glexec-osg-0.6.3

has been created in the VDT test cache.

The new glexec has been tested on 32-bit SL4 and SL5 and it does work on both, validating the proxy as expected.
(Both the functioning when the proxy can be validated, and the denial when it cannot be has been tested)
