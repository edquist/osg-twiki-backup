The [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/glexec.html][glexec]] configuration distributed with VDT does not validate the proxy it was given.
This could potentially allow an attacker to change to any other UID
(but not root) once on the worker node.

Subject: glexec security problem
Date: Mon, 15 Dec 2008 16:27:25 -0600
From: Sfiligoi Igor <sfiligoi@fnal.gov>

Hi all.

We just found out that glexec configuration distributed with VDT is
wrong and does not validate the proxy it is given.
This could potentially lead to an attacker to change to any other UID
(but not root) once on the worker node.

The error is in the LCMAPS configuration file
/etc/glexec/lcmaps/lcmaps-suexec.db

The current one (in VDT is)
------------------------
path = MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/MAGIC_VDT_LIB/modules

good = "lcmaps_dummy_good.mod"
bad  = "lcmaps_dummy_bad.mod"

gums = "lcmaps_gums.mod -exec
MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping"

glexec_get_account:
gums -> good | bad
------------------------

instead, it should be
------------------------
path = MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/MAGIC_VDT_LIB/modules

good = "lcmaps_dummy_good.mod"
bad  = "lcmaps_dummy_bad.mod"

gums = "lcmaps_gums.mod -exec
MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/MAGIC_VDT_PACKAGE/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping"

verifyproxy = "lcmaps_verify_proxy.mod"
           "--allow-limited-proxy"
           " -certdir /etc/grid-security/certificates"

glexec_get_account:
verifyproxy -> gums
------------------------
PS: This assumes the CA certificates are in /etc/grid-security/certificates.

---++ Summary

   * *Final Report*: [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/][OSG !DocDB Document ###]]

_What was the resolution of the incident?_

_What is the long-term mitigation plan (including changes in our operations, middleware or anything else that enabled the event) and timeline?_

_Deposit the final incident report in !DocDB and fill in the !DocDB URL and document number above._
