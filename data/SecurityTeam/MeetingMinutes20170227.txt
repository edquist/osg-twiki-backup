   * AHM Plan
      * Susan, Jeny, Dave: attending all 4 days     
      * Zalak: only attending Wednesday(03/08) and Thursday (03/09)
      * Susan has arranged for the "training" block to be a long office hours / ask us anything format.  Due to the wide range of questions in survey responses and short prep time, this seemed like the best way to serve the community's needs.
   
   * Year 6 goals
      * All: think on this, plan to cover in our March 20 call  (holding March 13 for an AHM postmortem and any backlog )

   * CVMFS masterkey hardware -- CERN is switching to using [[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CvmFS/YubikeySigning][Yubikey]].  Yubikey 4 is $40 on [[https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1487020270&sr=8-2&keywords=yubikey+neo][Amazon]]. Plan is for Dave to order one for himself to try out, and if all goes well order 3 for the GOC: production, ITB, and spare.  Susan approved via email last week.  Dave received key but hasn't had a chance to try it yet.

---++ New Business

   * COmanage service -- Dave received an admin account on the OSG instance on [[https://registry-beta.cilogon.org/registry/][CILogon's 2.0 COmanage]] service.  He hasn't had time to do much with yet though.
