      * Susan, Jeny, Dave: attending all 4 days     
      * Zalak: only attending Wednesday(03/08) and Thursday (03/09)
      * Susan has arranged for the "training" block to be a long office hours / ask us anything format.  Due to the wide range of questions in survey responses and short prep time, this seemed like the best way to serve the community's needs.
