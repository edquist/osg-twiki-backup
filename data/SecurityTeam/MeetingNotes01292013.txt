---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * Pakiti got approved. It will be in the software release today (January 29, 2013). What should we do about the central Pakiti service? Anand will send a list of tier3s that uses Pakiti and Kevin will ask whether these sites would like to install their own Pakiti. Then, we can turn off this service. https://osg-pakiti.ncsa.illinois.edu/
      * Next steps: FermiCloud volunteered to try it out. Kevin will make a demo of how to do the installation. The same demo will be made at the all hands meeting. Kevin will write a newsletter article for OSG newsletter. Kevin will try to make it to AHM on Monday. 
   *  Incident at XSEDE has no affect on OSG. We will check if there are any new users involved in the incident. 
   * Fermilab PKI. Kevin will get GridAdmin privilege. 

*Anand*
   * Condor vulnerability. 3 tickets are still open. Will run the script over the sites. Out of 98 gatekeepers, was able to run over 60 gatekeepers. 
   * Cilogon tests were completed. 
   * SHA-2 tests. No problems except for old version of Bestman. Has been in ITB for the past 4 weeks. We should grab the test end user and service certs form direct Digicert page for testing purposes. Mine will access Digicert portal and grab test certs with SHA-2. The goal is to complete this before the end of February. Mine will also check if the requirement to switch intermediate CAs is mandatory or not. 
   * What are the risks involved with using sha-1 and md5 user proxies on the grid? Anand will create a risk assessment.  
   * Fetch-crl v3 assessment. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityReview-fetchcrl3. Difference between v2 and v3: code is rewritten, has more options. Sent our results to Tim. He will release the new version. 
   * New IGTF release coming out. Nothing interesting in this release. 
   * Glideinwms incident drill. was able to submit jobs to test frontend at ucsd. how can we reach real production sites? Mine will ask Chander why we cannot access osg frontend. 


*Mine*
   * Traceability requirements in OSG and in Fermilab. 
   * CVMFS server risk assessment.  
   * CIlogon Basic CA. Writing policy and requirements to be reviewed by Fermilab.
