The local RSV probes are designed to run on each site.


---++ Probe to test freshness of the CRLs 

*Probe Name*:  crl-freshness-probe <br>
                         crl-freshness-wlcg-probe <br>
*Metrics*:  org.osg.local.crl.freshness <br>
                 org.osg.local.crl.wlcg.freshness <br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\> --warning-hours \<hour\>, --error-hours \<hours\> <br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files <br>
    =--error-hours=:  Number hours since the failing downloads before an error is issued <br>
    =--warning-hours=:  Number hours since the failing downloads before a warning is issued <br>
   (Default Values:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA, 3 days and 9 hrs respectively). <br>

---+++!! Description
This probe checks the last time when the CRLs were successfully downloaded. If any of the CRLs have not been updated for 9 hrs (warning-hours) the probe will issue a warning. This will be escalated to a critical error if a CRL has not updated for 72 Hrs (error-hours). This probe is intended to capture cases where the for any reason the CRLs of any CA were not updated or any of the CRLs are missing.

---+++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If any CRL files in CA directory have not been updated for 72 (error-hours) hours or if any CRLs are missing.
   * *warning*: If any CRL files in CA directory have not been updated for 9 (warning-hours) hours
   * *ok*: All other cases

---+++!! wlcg version of probe
 This version of the probe differs from the OSG version in that only CRLs from IGTF CAs are checked.


---++ Probe to test if CA certificates are up to date

*Probe Name*: cacert-verify-probe <br>
                        cacert-verify-wlcg-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.local.certificates.verify <br>
                org.osg.local.certificates.wlcg.verify <br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\>, --error-hours \<hour\> <br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files <br>
    =--error-hours=:   Number hours before an error is issued when the md5sums of local install does not match the md5sums at the GOC central location <br>
   (Default Values:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA and 3 days respectively). <br>

---+++!! Description
This is a local probe that verifies if the CA distribution at the site is upto date. This probe downloads a file contains a list of md5sum from a central location at the GOC. This list is compared against the md5sum of the files in the local repository. 

---+++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If warning state has persisted for 72 (error-hours) hours
   * *warning*: If the md5sums of the local CA do not match the GOC distribution. In case of wlcg probe the test also verifies if all the IGTF CAs are installed.
  * *unknown*: If the file containing the md5sums cannot be downloaded successfully from the GOC
   * *ok*: All other cases

---+++ !!Note
   * We don't maintain a separate list at the VDT, since the CAs distributed by VDT are just a subset of the OSG version.
   * Packages from both VDT and GOC will get updated asap when IGTF has a new release.
   * Once the security probes are deployed,  if the release time (of CA package) between OSG and VDT is more than 72 hrs off, sites which are downloading the CAs from VDT will start seeing failures in their CA probes.

---+++!! wlcg version of probe
The wlcg version of the probe checks if all IGTF CAs are installed at the site. (This is a requirement of WLCG)

---+++!! Update (July 2012)
Based on conversation with EGI folks it was decided that we will update the probes to go critical after 8 days instead of 3. This is especially important for sites that are using RPMs and do not have the auto-update feature turned on. Also Romain indicated that on WLCG these probe failures do not count as sanction, but in  the past we have been told this probe is counted towards towards WLCG availability. This needs to be clarified. 


Details on CA Update Procedure (from David Groep):
<pre>

EGI releases (via an IGTF-independent but EGI-standard repository) both
RPMS as well as DEB packages to the community. Sites that use
tym auto-update will pick this up automatically, but a broadcast is sent
anyway for sites that run this manually.

"Standard" upgrades allow for an 8-day period to upgrade, 'emergency"
upgrades allow for sites to be at most 24 hours behind before the probes
trigger a critical error.

The entire release process is documented at
  <https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_IGTF_Release_Process>
</pre>

Details of the relevant WLCG policy document from Romain Wartel
<pre>
The policy document relevant to this topic is the "Grid Site Operations Policy " (https://edms.cern.ch/document/819783).
All sites are bound to a number of conditions to be part of WLCG, including:

"4. When notified by the Grid of software patches and updates required for security and stability, 
you shall, as soon as reasonably possible in the circumstances, apply these to your systems. 
Other patches and updates should be applied following best practice."

The bottom line is that if the Grid (that's you + Mine here) ask sites to upgrade, they have to do it.

Also, if you have sites that are repeatedly caught running outrageously old and insecure software:
"10. The Grid may control your access to the Grid for administrative, operational and security 
purposes and remove your resource information from resource information systems if you fail to 
comply with these conditions. "

Back to CA Monitoring Probes. Note that while the probe triggers a critical error, the site is not suspended/banned. The site is contacted, but this notification does not count as a sanction.
 
If I remember well, the time to trigger a monitoring alarm is part of the "operational decisions" that have been used without a formal policy document to be written. 
The document David pointed is the official procedure for EGI sites.

---++ Probe to test if CA certificates needed by supported VOs are deployed

*Probe Name*: cacert-verify-supported-vo-local-probe <br>
*Metrics*:  org.osg.local.certificate.supportedvo.verify<br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\>, -- url-vo-ca \<URL\>,  --supported-vo-file \<FILE\><br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files  (Default Values:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA)<br>
    =--supported-vo=:  Location of the file that lists the VOs the site intends to support <br>
    =--url-vo-ca=:         Location of the central list which records all the CAs needed by any OSG VO <br>

---+++!! Description
This is a local probe that checks the supported VO list at the site and verifies if all the CAs needed by the VOs in that list are present at the site. The list of CAs needed by a VO is obtained from a central location at the GOC, the supported VO list is obtained from the $VDT_LOCATION/monitoring/ directory (can be changed by passing parameter). If any CAs needed by a VO listed in the osg-supported-vo-list.txt is missing the probe fails with a critical error.

---+++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If a CA needed by a VO supported at the site is missing.
  * *unknown*: If the file containing the VO to CA mapping cannot be downloaded successfully from the GOC
   * *ok*: All other cases


---++ Probe to test if the VOMS handshake is being conducted.

*Probe Name*: voms-handshake-verify-probe <br>
*Metrics*:  org.osg.verify.voms.handshake <br>
*Parameters* :--error-hours \<hour\>, --warning-hours \<hours\> <br>
    =--error-hours=:  Number of hours elapsed since the last run of edg-mkgridmap before an error is issued <br>
    =--warning-hours=:  Number of hours elapsed since the last run of edg-mkgridmap before a warning is issued <br>
   (Default Values:  3 days and 1 day respectively). <br>

---+++!! Description
This is a local probe that checks when edg-mkgridmap was last run. This probe reads the edg-mkgridmap.log file and looks for the timestamp associated with last entry identifying a completion of an edg-mkgridmap run. If the edg-mkgridmap has not run for a for over 1 day (warning-hours) a warning is issued which gets escalated to a critical error if the last run is over 3 days (error-hours) old.

---+++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If the last completion entry in the edg-mkgridmap log is over 3 days old.
   * *warning*: If the last completion entry in the edg-mkgridmap log is over 1 day old or if the log file is missing.
   * *ok*: All other cases

---+++ !! TO DO
This probe currently checks voms handshake of only edg-mkgridmap deployment. Once the corresponding functionality for testing VOMS handshake is available for GUMS site then this probe will be modified to work with both edg and GUMS deployment. 


---++ Probe to test if the handshake between VOMS server and the site was successful

*Probe Name*: voms-handshake-success-verify-probe <br>
*Metrics*:  org.osg.verify.voms.handshake.success <br>
*Parameters* : None <br>

---+++!! Description
This is a local probe that checks if the voms handshake between VOMS server and the site was successful. Currently this probe is only designed to test the success of handshake for only edg-mkgridmap. This probe read the edg-mkgridmap.log and looks if edg-mkgridmap reported any errors when contacting the VOMS server during the last run.

---+++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If the last execution of edg-mkgridmap reported an error
   * *warning*: If the log file cannot be found
   * *ok*: All other cases

---+++ !! TO DO
Need to develop the corresponding probe functionality for GUMS. Once the corresponding functionality for testing VOMS handshake is available for GUMS site then this probe will be modified to work with both edg and GUMS deployment.
