---++ Monitoring of Security Risks

The numbers in this document refer to the numbers in OSG Risk Management Table (Table 4, OSG Doc 488)

   * # 3 already being monitored
   * #4 We don't have many software (Monalisa may be exception, but it is not widely used), distributed by OSG,  that are updated independently from VDT/OSG cache. Reduce the grade
   * #16 We have basic monitoring
   * # 17 monitoring is available
      * #15,#16 and #17 are quite closely related and could be rolled up to single risk of someone unauthorized getting RA agent privileges
   * #26: This probably happens much more often but impact may not be that high. Monitoring is available but people may forget to check it.
   * #27 What are the symptoms to be monitored: *Need some monitoring*
      * If attacker issues certificates. if new certificates are issued, possibly can be seen in the site. cannot get into voms. 
      * Attacker's chance is to replicate old certificates. Users may notice different sites are used, increasing load on site. Both user and sites  may notice increased.  
      * Attacker revokes certificates: Number of authN errors will increase. number of users in gratia reports will sharply decrease. we will first hear user complaints.
      * Erase CRL files. we have monitoring for that. . we will see within one hour the online changes in a CA
   * #36 Why is this a medium severity, getting into mis or osg VO does not give users an root privileges on grid.
   * #38-39 are close to the risk identified in #15-17. Is there a difference between RA agent or RA being compromised or impersonated. Does Doug (RA) have more privileges than other agents. If RA is compromised , would that mean our monitoring system is compromised.  
   * #41: If software exploit has does not affect the  esnet database, we will see the new agents creation.
      * Action Item : get a percentage of users with existing CAs.
   * #42, #65, #70 can possibly be combined with #27. physical access
   * #67-69 be possibly be combined with #62-64
   * #72: Is this really a high severity problem. If the instructions are not malarious they might cause head for the admin but will not pose a high  risk.    
   * #72-73 How to monitor for Defacement? Does someone get a notice of what was updated daily and manually check if the updates look legitimate. *Need some monitoring*
      * Action Item : surveygizmo results look what twiki already does for monitoring
   * #74 not to monitor.
   * #75: whenever GOC sends (sensitive) emails they should sign it. Advise GOC.
   * #76 VOms compromised -- what can we monitor ? we are monitoring their availability. when we do the handshake. *Need some monitoring and review*
      * Action Item: edg does not check . GUMS does not check. The VO managers should monitor themselves. new user alert from gratia to VO manager
      * DDOS and DOS attacks are certainly possible but I dont know if it qualifies for the highest level risk.
      * Also many of our critical services are using or are moving to using secure distribution mechanisms to prevent MITM or DNS redirect attacks.
      * Make sure all critical services are secure
   * #80 have monitoring. vo and site admins gets emails.  So VO and sites to compare the gratia accounting. Should mitigate possibility of compromise going undetected double book entry.
   * #82 mis account comrpomise: mis do not have superprivileges. why is this any different than any other VO. mis have access to all sites. Rob needs to read VO gratia report.
