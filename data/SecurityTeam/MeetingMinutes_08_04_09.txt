OSG Security Meeting Minutes

   * The next year's security controls frequency and  assessment. Ron is working o the profile of the responses. 

   * Site admins meeting: prep work. discussion on risks introduced to a site by OSG. 
      * credential theft: this is not a risk to the site but risk to the VO. We encourage the sites to follow default template and isolate accounts but the main responsibility is with VOs to create the default template
      * data integrity: replace this with software vulnrability. there is no data integrity risk to the site except for software corruption
      * answer site admins questions Doug Johnson
      * emphasize our help in incident response. not an accusatory, policing tone. 
      * time and material length is a concern. which responsibilities to start with: learn how to communicate with security team, meet your local security team and learn to read signed emails.
