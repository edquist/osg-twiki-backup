   * Much progress on ECP !IdP.  SERVICES password and Kerberos now accepted on same server with two different URLs.  kcron is supported with kerberos.  Olga working on adding 'ou' attribute listing "People" or "Robots:kerbprincipalpart3:kerbprincipalpart2".  Jim Basney says cilogon can do the rest but we want to get him to do it soon before Olga moves on to another project.
   * Working on the CISR paper, about halfway through revising the second draft from Jeny and Mine
   * The oasis CRLs were only getting updated at 3,5, and 7am each day.  I got Mat to change it to every 6 hours.
