---++++ The OSG Security Survey 08

The 2008 security controls interviews are being done online, using the Sandbox.SurveyGizmo commercial website. It can generate surveys using multiple choice, text and other question types with minimum editing skills. There is also a useful distribution facility to invite participants, generate thank you notes, and collect the results. Survey reports can also be generated on the Sandbox.SurveyGizmo site. Sandbox.SurveyResults will be posted as they are compiled.

The following security control families were included:

   * Data Controls
   * Configuration Management Controls
   * Access and Site Management
   * Scanning
