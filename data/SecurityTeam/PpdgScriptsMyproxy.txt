---+ PPDG project with DOEGRids on enhanced usability and an OTP pilot

This is a short term project with two parts, enhancing the usability of the DOEGrids CA service, 
and a pilot project testing one time password tokens with myproxy in the contect of accessing OSG services.
The proposal is available at http://www.ppdg.net/docs/Proposals/doegrids-myproxy.pdf.

---++ DOEGrids Enhancements
---+++ Scripts
An set of scripts providing a command-line user interface to much of the DOEGrids CA service is provided by the PPDG script package, http://www.ppdg.net/RA/cert-scripts/. This package is an evolution of previous work from [[http://www.fusiongrid.org][FusionGrid]] and also [[http://www.nersc.gov][NERSC]].
This effort will add another script interfacing to the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Library/gridAdmin/gridAdminUser.html][Grid Admin]] interface,
that provides for immediate issuance of service certificates for pre-authorized grid service administrators.
The deployment, maintenance, and documentation aspects of these scripts will be reviewed and adjusted to meet the long term needs of DOEGrids and OSG.

---+++ Myproxy Service
A [[http://grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/myproxy/][myproxy service]] will be deployed for production use by OSG and other DOEGrids PKI customers.  As part of this deployment, DOEGrids staff will collaborate with the  myproxy developers at NCSA to develop and evaluate a plan for a robust, fault tolerant, replicated service that can provide a true 24x7x365 service.

---++ Myproxy OTP Pilot
For a variety of reasons the days of static password authentication to high-performance computing resources, grid services, etc. are numbered and some forms of one-time-password (OTP), two-factor authentication will be deployed by many of the resource providers connected to OSG.  
This pilot project will explore and report on some of the issues involved in making
a transition from current practices to the stronger authentication future.

Specifically, we have proposed to connect a myproxy server (a different instance than the first one mentioned above), with the ESnet Radius authentication fabric (http://www.es.net/raf/)
and then to a Cryptocard authentication server.  Then with a few stalwart volunteers we will
investigate the operational and deployment issues that would affect a broad deployment of a production service.  Due to PIV activities and/or other considerations it may be useful to also try out
different types of tokens or authentication services besides Cryptocard.

---++ Timeline & Deliverables
The target schedule is under discussion (as of 6 Oct. 2005) but everything should be completed
by June 2006 and occur in following order.

	1. Deploy standard myproxy server.
	2. Produce Grid Admin script and integrate with OSG documentation.
		* cert-gridadmin included in V1-7 of cert-scripts package, sent to VDT on 13 Dec 2005, should be included in VDT 1.3.10.
		* [[CEInstallPkiCertScripts][Documentation]] provided for OSG ITB CE Install Guide
	3. Start myproxy OTP pilot.
	4. Report on myproxy OTP pilot.

---++ Management

Main.DougOlson is coordinating this project within PPDG and it is (will be) included in the normal PPDG [[http://www.ppdg.net/docs/documents_and_information.htm][reporting channels]].  Mike Helm of ESnet and Mary Thompson from the LBNL Distributed Systems Department are key participants in this project.
