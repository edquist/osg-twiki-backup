   * We need to ask Operations team how many VOMS instances they run and how to switch their certs. If there is a single VOMS server then the new vomses file needs to be distributed immediately without a time lapse. Kevin should find out who manages the job submit machines. 
   * The script to auto-register users is working fine.
