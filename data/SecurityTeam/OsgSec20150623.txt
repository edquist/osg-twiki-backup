---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: High -  OSG website is one of the front-ends of OSG, this incident affects reputation. 
   * *Urgency*: Immediate - Fake entries must be removed and attack sources must be identified.

Multiple fake entries were added and posted to the OSG website. Entries with the same content were found on different sites around the web.
