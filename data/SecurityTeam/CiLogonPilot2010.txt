---++!! CILogon Basic CA Pilot Project

%TOC%

---++ Introduction
The CILogon Basic CA is part of the [[http://www.cilogon.org][CILogon project]] which aims to provide a logon
service for NSF cyberintrastructure (CI).
This CA will provide a user with an X.509 certificate following authentication to any of the [[http://www.incommon.org][InCommon]]
Identity providers (!IdPs).  !InCommon is a federation of about 250 institutions serving the higher educational community in the U.S.
with a goal of enabling users to access CI and other web-based services based on their login at their home institution.
We anticipate that this federation will eventually cover a significant fraction of the OSG user community.

Another CA in the CILogon project (CILogon Silver CA) has been accredited by the IGTF but as of October 2010 there are no
!InCommon members with !IdPs accredited at the Silver level and it is anticipated that the first universities will achieve that
accreditation in mid to late 2011.  This means no one is able to receive X.509 grid certificates from the CILogon Silver CA until
their home institution achieves the Silver level of accreditation.

In order to enable production level testing of the CILogon service and start to leverage the !InCommon federation,
the OSG is collaborating with the CILogon project
to enable sites to install the CILogon Basic CA easily and with some controls (described below) to compensate
for the lack of IGTF or !InCommon accreditation of the individual !IdPs
so that some users are able to begin to use the service.

---++ Review of OSG access model
When users access grid resources on OSG there are three levels of controls implemented
to ensure that the access is authorized and that the user, via their grid credentials, is identified
sufficiently.
These controls are:
   1 The CA issues X.509 certificates based on identity vetting in the registration process
   1 The VO asserts that a user is a member based on providing the identifier for the user in the VOMS server (the user's DN)
   1 The site enforcing the credential authentication/authorization checks that credentials received are from a trusted CA and listed in a trusted VOMS server.

CAs that are accredited by the IGTF are automatically included in the package of trusted CAs distributed by OSG.
In certain cases where there is a community need and OSG thinks that a non-IGTF accredited CA meets a sufficient
level of identity & credential quality, additional CAs are included in the distribution from OSG.  This includes CAs from !TeraGrid and Purdue,
and the FNAL KCA before it was accredited in IGTF.

---++ Controls restricting the scope of CILogon Basic CA
Any !InCommon member can publish an identity provider in the !InCommon metadata so that it is accessible to services provided by other
!InCommon members.  There are mostly universities but also some DOE laboratories as well as [[http://www.protectnetwork.org][Protect Network]] that runs a self-registration service where anyone can receive an !InCommon based on validation of email address.
One can expect that the credentials received from !IdPs have unique identifiers across all the !InCommon members but do not
necessarily allow you to identify who the person is that holds the credentials.
An example, from using the LBNL !IdP:
<verbatim>
$ openssl x509 -in x509up_u_olson.cilogon-basic.100901 -noout -subject -issuer
subject= /DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory/CN=Douglas Olson A241
issuer= /DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=CILogon/CN=CILogon Basic CA 1
</verbatim>
shows that the name of the organization and the name of the person are listed.

The primary grid services on OSG (gatekeeper, gridftp server) make use of the signing_policy file distributed with each trusted CA,
which allows sites to restrict what identities are acceptable for a given CA.
