In September 2009 the OSG security team sent all sites an announcement of six different kernel vulnerabilities that could affect their systems.  This page will track the progress of the different sites on the patching of their systems.

On September 29, six days after the OSG-SEC-2009-09-23: New Linux Kernel vulnerabilities announcement was sent, Mine ran a spot check on sites to see how many of the sites had updated their kernels.  There were 29 sites that had not been updated.  Because of the severity of the vulnerabilities it was decided that we needed to follow-up with sites to see when they would be fully patched.  A Kernel Patching Schedule email was sent to all the sites on Sept. 30th asking for replies back on their schedule.  Below is a list of the different sites and their current responses.

%RED%RED%ENDCOLOR% - Site has not patched (1).<BR>
%YELLOW%YELLOW%ENDCOLOR% - Site has not patched, but has scheduled downtime for patching (5).<BR>
%GREEN%GREEN%ENDCOLOR% - Site has patched (29).<BR>
BLACK - Site has not reported back (2).<BR>

Tom Rockwell <rockwell@pa.msu.edu> reported that: "There might be confusion over the 2.6.30 kernel.  When the Linux kernel fix for CVE-2009-2692 came out, there was an rc6 for 2.6.31 and an rc5 for 2.6.30.  We are using the second one.  On our systems that are using the stock Scientific Linux kernel, we have also updated with new kernels covering both of these issues."

Can you indicate what minimum version you were looking to achieve?"
