---++Data Integrity 

---+++ 1. Which core service or asset are you reporting for?  
BDII, !MyOSG, oasis (Stratum 0), oasis-replica (Stratum 1), rsv-collector, software-cache, OIM, repo, ticket, VOMS, gratia, display, homepage, jira, TWiki

---+++ 2. Have you read the OSG SecurityTeam Plan, Data Integrity section 2.3.3 within the past 12 months and understand your responsibilities for the proper handling of Sensitive Personal Data, Restricted Data, Limited Distribution Data and Public Data. This document can be found at the OSG DocDB website:  https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389  
yes

---+++ 3. If your service does not store, process, transmit any data, you may indicate it here and conclude the survey.  
N/A

---+++ 4. Are you the owner of the data? The data owner is responsible for collection, storage, and treatment of the data. Although you own the core service/process, there may be another person who owns the data. If so, please provide his/her name below, and answer the following questions with that person.  
Data voluntarily provided is distributed according to the posted "Privacy policy" linked, for example, at the bottom of this page. Ownership is retained by the contributors but no representation of privacy or protection is made.

---+++ 5. Please enter data name you own along with a very brief description and the data type. The data types are explained in Section 2.3.3  https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389.	  
---++++ 5A. Name  
OSG data

---++++ 5B. Description  
Contact information, resource descriptions and locations and a ticketing system are examples of the data presented by these services.

---++++ 5C. Type  
Public

---+++ 6. What is your data backup policy (e.g., weekly full, daily differential, etc.) ? 
Daily differential and weekly full. All services backup data to a specific machine (backup.grid.iu.edu) daily. When required, services are typically restored from the data stored on this machine. In the event a service must be restored and backup.grid has been damaged or is unavailable, backup itself is backed up daily (differential) and weekly (full). This accomplished by an external IBM service, TSM. This constitutes the off site component of our backup mechanism.

---+++ 7. Backups


---++++ 7A. How long do you retain the back-ups?  
Local backups are overwritten daily. Off site backups are maintained by a commercial service for several months.

---++++ 7B. How do you ensure that your data back-ups are stored correctly, protected and restorable?  
Data has been restored from the off site service during actual failures. TSM is contractually obliged to meet these criteria.

---+++ 8. Please list your on-call support email address and/or phone number in case of emergencies, such as unexpected power loss, security attacks or natural disasters.  
The on-call support person is the GOC Operations Manager, currently Scott Teige (812)340-0645. He decides who should be contacted if further manpower is required. If he is unreachable,
the OSG Operations Manager, currently Rob Quick (317)695-3276, is his backup. 

---+++ 9. Are you aware of any attacks against the data? What do you think is the biggest threat against the data?  
"fail2ban" runs continuously on all services covered here. If there are 6 or more failed access attempts the IP is banned. Attacks of this kind are detected approximately daily and are usually from China. These are considered a routine part of operating an outward facing service by the University and the GOC. There are no known successful attempts.

---+++ 10. If you own Restricted Data  please answer the following questions.  
No Restricted Data is owned

---++++ 10A. Who are the authorized people who can access this data? How do you determine this list of people?

N/A

---+++ 12. If you have any public data, please answer the following questions  
All data is public as described in the "Privacy Policy" linked below

---++++ 12A. What are the, if there are any, access control mechanisms applied to your Public data to maintain its integrity? (An example would be a list of the authorized people who can modify the data.) 											 
OIM implements a layered access control scheme. These layers consist of, for example, "End User", "Administrator", "GOC Staff" etc. Modification of data is permitted as appropriate for the authorization level of the user accessing it.

Login access by non-GOC staff is not allowed to any of the service machines listed in this section.

---+++ 4. Please indicate the version control system you employ for tracking changes to your service configuration. For e.g. do you maintain a change log that could be used to track and rollback any changes to configuration?  
SVN is used to maintain version numbered service configurations. We are in the process of switching to github for this function. Changes are documented and announced before they are implemented, for example. [[http://osggoc.blogspot.com/2014/06/goc-service-update-tuesday-june-10th-at.html][here]]. Collectively, these announcements constitute a change log for all services. Rollback capability is included in the mechanisms used to install new versions of out software.

---+++ 5. Please indicate the process of approving configuration changes for your core OSG service. Specifically what steps are taken to review the security implication of the proposed changes   
Change management policies (including security implications) are specified by [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ChangeMgmt][this document]].

There is no section 2.4.6, I have read 2.3.6.

---+++ 3. Physical access to all production core OSG systems must be controlled -- with a lock, key, etc.  Verify that  your core OSG resources comply with this requirement and are indeed in an access controlled area, as defined above.
Physical access to the data center is by card key and biometric controls. This access is granted on a need basis by University Information Technologies Services.

---+++ 4. Who among your team currently has root and sudo access on the OSG systems providing core services and what is the policy of granting such access?  
All GOC staff have root and sudo access to the services covered here.

---+++ 5. According to the OSG SecurityTeam Plan, network login or command line access to a production core OSG system shall be permitted only from a client via secure authorization and authentication mechanisms. Describe which authorization and authentication mechanisms you are using for secure network login or command line access by privileged staff versus unprivileged users.  
iptables defaults to "deny" unless specific rules grant "access".

---+++ 6. All production core OSG systems shall run the absolute minimum set of network services required for their functions.   Have you verified in the past year that your core OSG resource systems are running only those network services necessary for system operation? Also list the network services running that are deemed NOT necessary.  
yes

---+++ 7. All production core OSG service providers must have a plan describing redundancy or other mechanisms used to maintain service availability in case of operational disruption or emergencies. Please describe the redundancy plans that would be deployed for your core service to ensure availability in case of unplanned disruption or emergency.  
BDII, !MyOSG, and software-cache have multiple instances capable of performing their functions. All other services covered here can be rebuilt from scratch within one hour. The definitive statement of service availability is the Service Level Agreement (SLA) available [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/ServiceLevelAgreements][here]] for covered services.

---+++ 8. On each production core OSG system, a copy of the system and service logs shall be saved on line for at least 30 days.  Have you verified within the past year that this requirement is being met?  
yes

There are no sections 2.5.2 or 2.5.3. I have read sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3. 

---+++ 3. What authentication mechanism is employed for privileged access to core resources  
ssh access is required

---+++ 4.  How is privileged access to core resource granted and what authorization technique is used?  
GOC staff are given this access

---+++ 5. What is the authentication and authorization techniques used for non-privileged user access?  
No administrative access is given to users of the services covered here. 

---+++ 6. At what frequency are you scanning web services for vulnerabilities and what types of vulnerability scanning are being done?  
University SecurityTeam routinely scans the machines (with IBM Xforce) hosting the covered services. There is no fixed schedule for this but all machines are covered over a period of approximately 3 months. Any existing, relevant vulnerabilities are addressed based on the criticality of the vulnerability. 

---+++ 7. What remedial procedures are followed when vulnerabilities are detected?  
Highest priority vulnerabilities are addressed as emergencies, others are resolved on the fourth Tuesday of the month. Determination of the level of action is by the Operations Manager in consultation with the system administrator.

---+++ 8. What steps are being taken to scan for local vulnerabilities/intrusion detection and how often?   
The University uses an IBM product (Xforce) to scan for vulnerabilities with all machines scanned approximately every three months. "fail2ban" runs continuously to detect attempted unauthorized access.
