---+!! GOC Transition from HTTP to HTTPS

---++ The problem

GOC is currently distributing the CA certificates and pacman caches via HTTP.
This leaves OSG vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle attacks.

To close this security gap, GOC is planning on providing the above services using HTTPS.

This document lists the steps needed for a smooth transition.

---++ Deploying the HTTPS server

In Aug 2009, GOC has acquired a SSL Web Server Certificate from a well known private CA.
They are currently in the process of deploying the HTTPS server.
