There are three existing documents with definitions and assumptions about organizations, roles and cyber entities.
These are
   * the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=18][blueprint document]]
   * the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=47][operations model]]
   * the [[Operations.RegistrationInstructions][registration instructions]] for resources, VOs and support centers

The blueprint document defines a number of terms and many of them are relevent so this is the entire set:
   * *User* - A person who makes a request of the Open Science Grid infrastructure. 
   * *Resource Owner* -  has permanent specific control, rights and responsibilities for a Resource associated with ownership.
   * *Agent* - A software component in OSG that operates on behalf of a User or Resource Owner or another Agent.
   * *Consumer* - A User or Agent who makes use of an available Resource or Agent or Service.
   * *Provider* - Makes a Resource or Agent or Service available for access and use.
   * *Ownership* - A state of having absolute or well-defined partial rights and responsibilities for a Resource depending on the type of control. OSG considers two such types: actual Ownership and Ownership by virtue of a Contract/Lease. A Lessee is a limited Owner of the Resource for the duration of the Contract/Lease.
   * *Service* - A method for accessing a Resource or Agent.
   * *Site* - A named collection of Services, Providers and Resources for administrative purposes. A Facility is a collection of Sites under a single administrative domain.
   * *Virtual Organization* - A dynamic collection of Users, Resources and Services for sharing of Resources (Globus definition). A VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo is party to contracts between Resource Providers & VOs which govern resource usage & policies. A subVO is a sub-set of the Users and Services within a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo which operates under the contracts of the parent
   * *Virtual Site* -  is a set of sites that agree to use the same policies in order to act as an administrative unit. Sites and Facilities negotiate a common administrative context to form a "virtual site or facility. 
   * *Dynamic Workspace* - A persistent, extensible, managed collection of objects and tools hosted on a grid.
   * *Policy* - A statement of well-defined requirements, conditions or preferences put forth by a Provider and/or Consumer that is utilized to formulate decisions leading to actions and/or operations within the infrastructure.
   * *Contract* - Agreement between Consumer(s) and/or VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo(s) and/or Provider(s) expressed through Policies. Simplest contract is a consumer-provider match based on their policies. 
   * *Delegation* - An entrustment of decision-making authority during transfer of request for work or offer of resources from a User or Agent to another Agent or Provider, or vice versa. The latter is provided with a well-defined scope of responsibility and privilege at each such layer of transfer of request or offer. 
   * *Economy* - Set of benefits made and costs accrued as seen by Consumers and Providers.
   * *Security* - Control of and reaction to intentional unacceptable use of any part of the infrastructure.
   * *Grid* - A named set of Services, Providers, Resources, and Policies, overlapping and/or including other Grids operating as a coherent infrastructure in support to the contracting Virtual Organizations. Providers may delegate their contracts with the participating VOs to the Grid administration.

Referenced Definitions:
   * *Namespace* - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace   
   * *Resource* - Item 2 and 5 at http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=resource

The operations model defines organizations and their roles and responsibilities w.r.t. OSG operations
and for the support domain (covering the services, resources, user community, etc.) for which they
are responsible.
The general term for an organizational entity providing support for "things" around OSG is Support Center.
The operations model considered five sets of roles for support centers, one for each of the types
of "things" that require support.  As shown in Figure 2 in the 
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=47][operations model]] document,
these are:
   * VO
   * Resource Provider
   * grid service
   * middleware
   * grid operations

The VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Support Center roles generally cover issues about the members of the VO, the grid users. 
This includes managing the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service that defines membership in the VO, registering users into the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS service, assuring that
they have proper grid identity credentials, assisting with incidents involving their users, helping troubleshoot grid application problems, etc.

The Resource Provider, grid service, and middleware Support Center roles are to provide support, and communications
via the GOC to people using the services provided. Until now, a security contact has only been required for those services
that store grid credentials (including proxies).

The Grid operations Support Center is the core OSG operations support which includes many functions and services.
I don't think we have formally registered other grids (EGEE, TeraGrid, ...) as a grid operations Support Center yet, should we?
Some campus & regional grids have been registered as VOs.

Each particular Support Center organization can fill a variety of these roles.  Several support both VOs and resources.
