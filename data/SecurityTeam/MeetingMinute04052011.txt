---+++ Meeting with Alain Deximo on 4/8/2011
   * Very good week. We have only three late cert requests. Alain doubled the number of email pings to the Agents to follow the process. Most complied well. When the request was getting really old, Alain cc the requestor as well. 
   * This week Kyle is acting as the RA. He is testing the documentation and the processes. TODO: We found out one problem that when approving an Agent, only Alain's email and certificate are registered with DOE as the RA. We should register the back up personnel as the RAs as well. 
   * We will meet with the Agents next week. Alain is setting up the meeting. Alain and Mine will meet before the meeting to decide what type of training to give to the Agents
   * TODO: We need to make one more official announcement to the community that Alain is the RA. People still sometime try to contact Doug Olson.
