   * Olga got Kerberos support working in ECP !IdP, including kcron support.  She's now working on doing SERVICES password authentication on the same server that's supporting Kerberos
   * Jim Basney said cilogon can add on /CN=UID:&lt;uid&gt;.  Do we want to change the non-ECP !IdP the same way?
   * Authentication services group should be able to generate the list of all uids to DN translation
   * Met with software developers with final KCA w/ECP replacement design
   * Mostly finished OASIS implementation of signing external repository .cvmfswhitelist files, deployment scheduled for October 13
   * OSG software installation instructions now use https for installing the base rpms that include GPG keys
   * Had discussion about CRLs in CVMFS, needs more discussion including by Executive Team.  I obtained access to the oasis-login account that generates them so I can help debug if it gets stuck again and I see the ticket before Mat or Brian.
   * Jeny made first draft of the paper, I need to work on it next week
