   * Back from vacation
   * Looks like no new major vulnerabilities while I was gone?
   * Soichi ran into issue with digicert test certs and fetch-crl, I believe due to file names on the web site. Should we distribute an rpm with these?
   * Look into google authenticator compatible auth servers.
   * SecurityTeam controls assessment. Track down folks that haven't completed surveys while I was gone.
