   1 OSG CATests. 
      * Finished OIM functionality testing.
      * Move CILogon OSG CA cert to separate rpm?
   1 Fermilab KCA to Cilogon Basic CA transition. 
      * Talked to Olga. They are looking for a new IDP support vendor. Will ask about kerberos support in the process.
   1 Investigated lshell vulnerabilities. 
      * Talked to Nate Paul. Does not appear to be any unpatched vulnerabilities in lshell. May not be suitable for critical system protection, but given that a user could do anything in a submitted job, lshell should be suitable.
   1 Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill.
   * Digicert finally getting around to fixing the backwards DN in the SHA-2 intermediate cert. Will re-submit to IGTF.
