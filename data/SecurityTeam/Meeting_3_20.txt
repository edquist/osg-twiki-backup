   * Doug will start a twiki page where he will list: 
	1) the questions we should ask sites and VOs 
	in case of an incident. we can have a separate questionnaire for each 
	2) the list of log files that can help sites/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo to answer above questions
	this list later be incorporated with VDT
	3) the privacy statement: that sites/VOs must tell us how much of incident information
	can be disclosed to other sites and VOs. we must remind sites/VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo each time about their preference
