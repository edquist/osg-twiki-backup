---++ Meeting Minutes 5/11/2010

*Jim:*

   * Can Jim join the egi-csirt or osct mailing lists. They usually have very useful information. grid-sec is used for incident sharing across the grids. So one can argue there is no additional need to sign into osct. The reason for joining osct is not only incident information but learning other useful practical operational information, which usually does not make it to grid-sec. Jim will ask Romain
   * FIRST.org. Mine is thinking about going. Leif Nixon is also attending. But Romain will not. 
   * The SSC4 is explained at https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LCG/SSC4Evaluations
      * is this useful, what is it about? should we perform one in OSG? is this essentially what Igor did with portal audits. maybe we should skip doing Atlas audit
*Igor:* 
   * *Action Item* Atlas ssc4. Igor will understand whether this drill is sufficient to skip atlas audit.  
   * SBgrid and NEbiogrid, users submit jobs under their own name. Tracking the user can happen at the site. There is no dependence on the portal access control mechanisms. 
 

*Doug:* 
   * Certificate request works with safari. Mine will correct the documentation. Because page says it cannot work.   
   * *Action Item* certificate renewal by command line scripts are missing. we want to have more than the man pages. We want to have the instructions to renew a certificate.   
   * itb test of the new layout. it is going ok so far. Doug has not looked at the robot testing result. the current CA package version is deployed a week ago. So far, it did not cause trouble for John Weigand. installed on lbl itb site. Doug will learn when robot testing started and what the test results are. Once he looks at the itb test results, then he will make a list of software that is not tested in ITB and may possibly fail due to the new layout. 
   * CMS registration page. Mine and Doug will talk during the rest of the week. Mine has read the cms documentation.  


*Anand:* 
   * Need a list of ra agents. *Action Item* Doug will prepare the list today
   * Michal will prepare the official rpm by friday
   * one of the java scripts provided by doegrids is not working,
