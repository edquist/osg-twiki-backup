---++ Security Review fetch-crl3 

---+++ Task Description
At the request of the software coordinator we conducted a security review of fetch-crl v3 to see if it is OK to be used in OSG production.

---+++ Test Details

Anand conducted the review. v 3.0.7-1 from checked out from osg-testing cache 

   1.  We conducted functional tests with both new and old format CA package, on both regular and sha2 signed CA certificates (used DOEGrids sha2 cert from ITB 1.32). No problems were observed  in any test case  with obtaining and updating crl files.
   2. Since RSV probes depend on it, we also checked if the time stamps of crl file get updated everytime fetch-crl is run. 
   3. Since Tim reported that OSG was already using fetch-crl3 on el6 system, we conducted our tests on an el5 system. 
   4. Finally, we did a quick code review going through its logic and did not find any security concern. 

---+++ Findings
It seems OK for OSG to adopt fetch-crl3 in production.
