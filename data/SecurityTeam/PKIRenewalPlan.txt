This document describes plans for certificate renewal in the OSG PKI.

It is current a draft and comments to vwelch@indiana.edu are welcome.

---++ Certificate Lifecycle

   * 0-6 months: Certificate cannot be renewed.
      * To prevent multiple accidential renewals.
   * 7-12 months: Certificate can be renewed.
   * 12-13 months: Weekly notifications are sent to certificate owner reminding them of renewal.
   * 13 months: Certificate expires, cannot be renewed.

Note that, by policy, user vetting is required every 5 years and renewal is only possible if user has been vetting in past 5 years.

---++ Decisions

   * Users may request renewal of their own certificate.
      * RAs may not request renewal of a user's certificate.
   * The original requestor of a host/service certificate may request renewal for a certificate they originally requested.
   * A Grid Admin may request renewal of any host/service certificate they are authorized to approve.
