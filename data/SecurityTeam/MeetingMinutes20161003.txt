   * A vulnerability was found in the canl-c library, OSG received the report from EGI Software Vulnerability Group. By exploiting this vulnerability it is possible for a user with any certificate, including a self-created one, to impersonate any other user. A security announcement was sent earlier in the week to let the site administrators know about the vulnerability and encouraging them to update ASAP. 
      * https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31371
   * OpenSSL released security patches last September 22nd, 2016 for multiple vulnerabilities. The most important one allows a DoS due to memory exhaustion through continuous renegotiation (OCSP status request extension). Additionally, on September 26th, OpenSSL made urgent releases because new vulnerabilities were introduced in latest security patches. I contacted GOC team and they confirmed that the first set of releases did not make it into OSG repositories, so, the vulnerable versions were not going to be installed during next GOC scheduled maintenance.
   * Security training for new VO was conducted for SouthPole VO. Zalak (new member of OSG security team) called in and assisted to the training as part of his onboarding process. Security training for VOs: miniclean and project8 is still pending.
   * Attended Webinar: The Tragedy of the Commons scheduled by CSTC on September 26th. 
   * Worked on poster for CHEP 2016: "Grid Access with Federated Identities" after an initial meeting where we received feedback from Tanya and Margaret.
   * Wrote FIFE news article about DCAFI close-out report and Phase 2.
   * Contacted Irwin again to ask him if he checked the Addendum for the Security guidelines for IF experiments. We wrote one for NOvA a few weeks ago and need his approval.
   * Brian Lin asked if he should implement the generation of 2048-bits keys for OSG- PKI-tools -in certificate user requests- https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2136
