   * Made talks for WLCG tracceability/isolation working group and OSG Staff retreat, the talks went OK.
   * Jim Basney has furthered IGTF discussion about OSG changing CILogon Silver CA to use BIRCH level of authentication, so far so good.  Comments about it at the OSG Staff retreat is that they could be OK with it if it only took a small amount of OSG staff time.
   * Further discussion, probably development needed for automating host cert renewals
