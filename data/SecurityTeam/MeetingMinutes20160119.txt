   * Security guidelines to IF experiments: Met with production people from Minerva and OPOS to check about the technical implementation of the security control that log outs users from the shared accounts after 60 minutes of inactivity.
   * OSG CA transition: Coordinated with Gluex and Star VO managers about the VOMS server certificates update and the announcement to their community. 
   * VOMS skip issuer check configuration: Installed a fresh VOMS server for testing. Found that the --skipcacheck flag is available for configuration starting from VOMS 2.0.12 version. OSG currently ships VOMS 2.0.13. OSG Software is already working on a patched version of VOMS-admin that enables this configuration directly from the web interface. 
   * OpenSSH vulnerability: Learned about a new vulnerability reported in OpenSSH client. RedHat produced a security update. Globus and XSEDE published announcements for users community. 
   * CISRC'16 paper: Working on the camera-ready version of the paper. In the next weeks, we will be working on addressing the comments for reviewers.
