NCSA NERSC and CERN could be used for backup personal certs. Which users should get certs first. Most impactful users. if DOEgrids goes out of business, Ruth and Steve should talk. 
Outage of how long. outages longer than 30. porting to a new CA is very costly. what is the cost of alternative CA suppliers. 
Doug needs to find out how many active users on average. 
will talk to NCSA CA

security posting. tested it. OIM. looks good to Doug. change instructions and references.
