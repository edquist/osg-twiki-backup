   * New Vulnerabillities/Security Incidents: Jeny
      * HIGH' risk vulnerability concerning SLURM workload manager prolog script, which may allow a user to assume control of an arbitrary file on the system. Sites running SLURM are recommended to update relevant components as soon as possible (CVE-2016-10030)
      * Linux kernel vulnerability described in CVE-2016-7117.
         * Ticket https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31838 was closed because we could not find any grid software using recvmsg function. However, there are updates for RedHat and Scientific Linux. Should we send an announcement?
      * Possible DDoS Attack on OSG TWiki: https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/32198
         * Asked for the countermeasures used to mitigate this issue. Need to check the logs.

   * OSG CVMFS master signing key is now required by the Security Officer to be kept offline most of the time.  One consequence that Scott Teige doesn't like is that if a new oasis machine is installed, and we have to back out to a previous VM, he has to run a command by hand with the master key installed.  The only way that I can think to automate recovery is if the master key could be kept always accessible, such as on a smart card.  Do we agree this is a good idea?
   * CERN security would like VOMS-admin extended to support federated identity to register people in VOMS.  Brian B would instead like OSG to move in the direction of using COmanage with a VOMS plugin.  He is asking if I put some effort into that transition.
   * JINR has installed cilogon CA info along with a signing_policy listing only Fermilab, but glexec is apparently still not working
   * We (Mine, Jeny, and I) have to write a DCAFI section of a FIFE CHEP paper.  I am busy writing another CHEP paper.
