   * fifebatch machines had SSLv3 enabled on port 443, flagged by Fermilab security.  This port is only used by cigetcert, to read cigetcertopts.txt, which we want to be able to be read from offsite.  First attempt on fifebatch-preprod accidentally disabled TLSv1 which is the only version currently supported by cigetcert.
      * That's fixed in codereview branch to work with any TLS version but not yet released.  I could probably release the branch as-is but there's some parts of the codereview not yet addressed.
      * I helped  Neha come up with apache options that make its cipher support almost the same as cilogon's: <pre>
      SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
      SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!LOW:!EXP:!RC4:!IDEA:!SEED
</pre>
      * I found a tool in epel 'sslscan' that shows exactly which ciphers are enabled.   The only difference is now that cilogon has also disabled ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA and EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA, and I haven't found any reason to do disable those.  The guide I was going by is at [[https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet][owasp.org]].
      * I also noticed that myproxy has SSLv3 enabled on the myproxy port 7512.  There's a [[http://lists.globus.org/pipermail/myproxy-user/2014-October/000290.html][message from Jim Basney]] that says how to disable it but that also says that they do not believe that the myproxy protocol is vulnerable to POODLE so it isn't important to disable SSLv3 on myproxy.  I made a Fermilab service desk ticket to ask that the myproxy.fnal.gov administrators consider disabling SSLv3 on myproxy.
   * Scheduling a meeting with Steve Tuecke regarding Globus Auth, the 23rd seems best at this point.
   * Trying to get Brian to meet with us to talk about singularity

   * Worked on HEPCloud Risk assessment document
   * Generated an addendum of the security guidelines for IF experiments: exception for NOvA, allowing 17 people in the .k5login.
      * SCIS will do an annual review of the security practices for each IF experiment.
   * Pending: security training for new VOs.
   * Met with Gabriele G. who was contacted by Atlas site (MWT2)  asking for security policies, more specifically technical controls to improve the security of the grid nodes.
