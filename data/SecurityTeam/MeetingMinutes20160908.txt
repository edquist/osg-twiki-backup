   * fifebatch machines had SSLv3 enabled on port 443, flagged by Fermilab security.  First attempt on fifebatch-preprod accidentally disabled TLSv1 which is the only version currently supported by cigetcert.
      * That's fixed in codereview branch to work with any TLS version but not yet released.  I could probably release the branch as-is but there's some parts of the codereview not yet addressed.
      * I helped  Neha come up with apache options that make its cipher support almost the same as cilogon's: <pre>
      SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
      SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!LOW:!EXP:!RC4:!IDEA:!SEED
</pre>
      * I found a tool in epel 'sslscan' that shows exactly which ciphers are enabled.   The only difference is now that cilogon has also disabled ECDHE-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA and EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA, and I haven't found any reason to do disable those.
   * Scheduling a meeting with Steve Tuecke regarding Globus Auth
   * Trying to get Brian to meet with us to talk about singularity

   * Pending: security training for new VOs.
   * Met with Gabriele G. who was contacted by Atlas site (MWT2)  asking for security policies, more specifically technical controls to improve the security of the grid nodes.
