---++ Security Meeting Notes

 Present: JIm, Ron, Doug, Rob, Mine

1) TACC CA is down and received a compaint form Frank W about RSV probes. RSV probes counted the site as down. Jim will examine the issue. This is a TeraGrid CA. Jim says there is a monitoring service for TeraGrid CAs. He will check why monitor did not alert the issue.

would it be meaningful if the probe gives a warning instead of a failure. Mine says this is not up to us to define. WLCG defines the probes. 

Jim suggest why can't we have a monitoring of CAs for the security team. We are requesting this as wish-list item into RSV and GOC team

Catalin also listed some more IGTF CAs that do not update their CRLs. IGTF should do something about their monitoring.Jim will file a complaint.

2) Registering core assets to OIM. Rob says within two weeks the new resource type would be ready. We can use this new type to register core services

3) a discussion of which OIM data is public vs, private vs. OSG-staff only. This will be done at next OPs meeting
