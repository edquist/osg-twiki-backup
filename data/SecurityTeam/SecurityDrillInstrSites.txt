---++Security Drill Instructions for Sites 

The OSG Security Team will be conducting a Security Service Challenge (SSC) of Tier 1 sites in coordination with the EGEE/LCG Operational Security Coordination Team.

The Security Team will submit a test job under a Test Operator's credentials to each site. The test operator and the test job will be assumed as malicious. Once the test job starts, the security team will send email to site security contacts requesting prompt investigation of the activities of the Test Operator at their site.

Sites are requested to follow normal security incident response procedures.

*In particular: following steps are expected to be taken*

1) The security team will send an alert email to site security contacts. The email subject line will contain [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL]. This marks the beginning of the drill.

2) Site contacts should send an immediate reply to security@opensciencegrid.org confirming they received the email alert. Sites will be graded based on how quickly they replied.

3) Sites must include [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL] in ALL of their email subject lines.

4) Sites immediately start their investigation on the incident. At every step, sites should send email updates to the security team email address directly (osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org)

At a minimum, sites are expected to:

5) find the test process and kill them. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this step.

6) ban the test user from submitting additional jobs. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.

7) Discover the incoming IP address of the test process. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.

8) Do an analysis of the network traffic (broader the better: there will be bonus points). Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.

9) Do an analysis of submitted binaries (there will be bonus point) . Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.

Sites will be graded based on:

1) how fast they respond to the incident alerts

2) how quickly and how well they are able to accomplish steps 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

3) Bonus points will be given to sites who accomplishes more than outlined above.

Please note that No sanctions must be applied against the Virtual Organization (VO) that was used to submit the job.
