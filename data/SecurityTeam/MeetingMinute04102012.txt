   * IGTF release is complete. No new releases are expected. Documentation is available on CA release steps. 
   * Completed the software setup. Technical preparation is complete. Setup a time to conduct the incident drill with ivolved sites. 
   * Cert-Request script looks up list of VO. xml-parser is needed to parse the list of VOs. Parser library needs to be configured. Therefore, every CE who downloads the code will have to configure the parser. GOC only wants to provide xml file. GOC retired old csv file while during some transition. Static list comes with code itself. Ask GOC to include a step in their VO onboarding process that they send out a ticket to security team. The security team will manually add the VO. 
   * Voms vulnerability ticket 11924 is closed. Question remains for how to update pacman release of VOMS. This is a low risk that we can overlook the patch for pacman if needed. 
   * Next CA release will be only made to new GOC repo. Scott gave us a list if sites who hits the old repo. Contact the sites why they are still contacting the old repo. 

*Kevin*
