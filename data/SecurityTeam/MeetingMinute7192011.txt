---++ Meeting Minutes

*Jim*: Last Thursday, a security incident at two Canada EGI (part of Atlas) sites had been discovered. They are root level compromises. Jim will send an announcement to OSG sites today. attackers set up a trojan sshd and logged into the machine remotely. the IP address of the attacker will be put into the announcement. Both sites had a large number of worker nodes: a few thousands. Attackers ran bitcoin algorithms over the nodes. People generate money running bitcoin algorithm trying to find next set of legitimate keys. Canadian sites do not know how attackers gained access initially. No known attack vector. We should find out whether other user's shh keys or certificates are compromised on the nodes.  There is no user list on that machine. they are getting back up online as of yesterday. They discovered the attack through increased cpu usage. Attacker installed ps and other rpms to hide his tracks. Very sophisticated attack. We wonder how they ran over the cluster. Either they logged into each worker node individually or submitted jobs from the login nodes. 

   * Also looking at the ST&E report and questionnaire answers. Igor will also look.  
   * Documentation with Robert Engel. Chatted with Robert before vacation. We need to meet with Robert to set things. Marco's documentation is really good. It just should get into the twiki. 

*Marco*: looking at twki pages to figure out where to put things on twiki. 

*Igor*: nothing to report. 

*Mine*: out on Th and Friday. Jim is out Friday too. But he will watch out for vulnerabilities, incidents etc. Igor will also keep an eye.
