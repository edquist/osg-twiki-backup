%TOC%

---+++TeraGrid Incident
No KDC ticket was found for user cdetar. This means there is NO KCA certificate issued in the last 7 days. This is later confirmed by FNAL KCA operations team.

Aashish will write an announcement draft from TG perspective so that we can distribute it to our security contacts. We do not need to mention TG incident details. I rather like to mention malicious IP addresses and precautions for OSG sites

Jim will help Aashish to gain access to OIM. OIM includes all of our site, VO security contacts informations.

we have trouble with announcing sensitive incident information. SecurityTeam contacts sign up an email list as a contact address. The sensitive information gets stored on a public server. Aashish will ask site admins to register with twiki and announces sensitive information on the twiki
    
Mine still has not subscribed to TG incident response list. She will do that

---+++VORS 
Igor worked with GOC to understand which sites failed the VORS tests. We received a list of sites which are still failing. 
Rob gave us the ticket numbers and Igor will check the failure reasons. We will find the precautions to prevent this form happening again. 

Once we get everything settled, Igor will make a test to see how quickly the propagation from VOMS to sites are happening. 

Right now we have no RSV probes to check site configurations of gums or gridmapfile. 
Igor will look at RSV security probes to see if we need a new probe. The list of sites using GUMS is here https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SecurityTeam/RSVSecurityProbesPhase3V2

---+++RSV probes
Anand finished the distribution availabilit probe and CA probe. He will check with Arvind again on site probes. 
He will document vdt-ca-update script including debugging and logging options. The documentation will be done from a site amdin perspective.
