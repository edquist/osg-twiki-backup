*Doug*
   * Workshop organization. For the stakeholders workshop, we have not gotten a firm answer from Warren or Scott but one of them intends to come. Have not heard from Ian Stoked or Patrick Brady. have not heard from Jeff porter 
      * the survey for all VOs are https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDQyOWR4bTNfNVNKeVJleHVnT3NCTkE6MA
      * the web site for the workshops https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/osg/osg-esnet-activities-2/osg-esnet-identity-management-workshops
      * most people confirmed for the first workshop (technical--evolving identity). 
   * Operational issues: Hungarian CA is expiring in three weeks. China CA is offline and nobody knows what is going on. 
      * we can put a new distribution and remove these CAs. Hungarian CA is being used by uscms and usatlas. China CA is not used by any VOs. If we let the CA expire in the distribution, the users will not gain access and the sites will be punished. So the best thing to do is to remove the CA one week before its expiry.  
   * We have a list of VO vs CA at http://everest.cigi.uiuc.edu:8008/tmp/vo_ca_mapping.txt

*Jim*
   * can we put up a public page
   * can we follow up with all sites who have not patched yet.
