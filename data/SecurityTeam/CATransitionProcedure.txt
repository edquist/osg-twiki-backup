---+ OSG CA Transition Procedure
The OSG CA was designed with a modular backend, so different backend CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to transfer signing to a new backend CA.

---++ Prerequisites
   * OSG OIM modified to allow selecting which backend CA will sign cert requests for that VO.
   * Testing procedure completed.
   * New backend CA signed user certs will still have the same numeric suffix.

---++ Steps to transition
   * Ask VO to transition and pick date to swtichover.
   * Before the switch date, have VO's VOMS admins add cert DNs from new backend CA to existing users in their VOMS server.
   * Switch VO in OIM to get certs from new backend CA.
   * Have admins in new VO get new user and host certs for initial systems to verify everything is working. Identify systems dependent on host/service cert DNs and update as needed.
   * Users and admins get new certs as old certs expire.
