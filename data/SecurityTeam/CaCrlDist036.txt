---+ Understanding the CA-Certificates package

This page has the status of my analysis of the CA-Certificates package distribution in pre-release OSG 0.3.6. - D. Olson

Discussed at VDT office hours 16 Mar 2006. Alain expects to get changes into CA-Certificates in a couple days so when people get the released 0.3.6 (and 0.4.1) it will have the fixes.

---++ CRL status Table

The following tables lists CAs for which I did not get a CRL, either because the .crl_url file is not provided in the distribution or because fetching the CRL failed for some reason.

Comments:
   1 The PSC KCA cert is signed by the PSC root CA and it has a distributed CRL.
   2 VDT should include crl_url file. Alain has it now.
   3 CRL exists but I am not sure where it is.

Status:
   * :ok: understood and no problem
   * :) not a problem but VDT could do something
   * :( understood and VDT should do something
   * :confused: not understood and still under investigation
