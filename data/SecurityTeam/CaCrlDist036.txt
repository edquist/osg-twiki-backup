---+ Understanding the CA-Certificates package

This page has the status of my analysis of the CA-Certificates package distribution in OSG 0.3.6. - D. Olson

---++ CRL status Table

The following tables lists CAs for which I did not get a CRL, either because the .crl_url file is not provided in the distribution or because fetching the CRL failed for some reason.


| *Resolved?* | *CA* | *has crl_url?* | *is CRL published by CA* | *CN* | *Where* | *Still in use?* |

Comments:
	1 The PSC KCA cert is signed by the PSC root CA and it has a distributed CRL.
	2 VDT should include crl_url file. Alain has it now.
	3 CRL exists but I am not sure where it is.

Status:
	* :ok: understood and no problem
	* :) not a problem but VDT could do something
	* :( understood and VDT should do something
	* :confused: not understood and still under investigation
