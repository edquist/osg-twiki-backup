*Security Notification for University of Toronto Incident 

<verbatim>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello Security Contacts:

[ Please do not distribute without explicit permission from OSG Security Team] 

The OSG Security Team has been informed that an account for user
"Bertrand Brelier" has been compromised after an incident at the
University of Toronto. We see that the user is a member of the ATLAS
VO:

 "C=CA/O=Grid/OU=lps.umontreal.ca/CN=Bertrand Brelier" usatlas4

Other possible compromised certificates are:

        "C=CA/O=Grid/OU=physics.utoronto.ca/CN=Brelier Bertrand"
        "O=GRID-FR/C=FR/O=CNRS/OU=LPSC/CN=Bertrand Brelier"

We have determined that the user's DN was suspended from the Atlas VO
at CERN, the Canadian CA has revoked the user's certificates, and the
GRID-FR certificate is expired.

The Security Team recommends that you should update your CRLs and VO
membership information (via GUMS or edg-mkgridmap).

Also, if you notice any ssh connections from 128.100.75.72, please
investigate and notify the Security Team.

This notice is only for caution and awareness. No compromise is
detected for the user's account in OSG.

Please inform the OSG security team if you find any unusual activity
with respect to this user account or if you have any
questions/concerns.

Thanks a lot,

Aashish Sharma
