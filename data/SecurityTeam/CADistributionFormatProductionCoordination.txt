---++ Coordinating tests of new CA distribution format on production sites
%TOC%
The proposed change in the CA package due to the new layout from IGTF to accommodate openssl 1.0 is slated to go into production on OSG with the next IGTF release. The changes have already been identified in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP7][SEP7]] and implemented. However since this change affects our security infrastructure significantly the security team will like to have the changes tested on few older versions of Production sites before we roll out a production deployment. For this purposes the chosen test sites will be asked to temporarily install the CA package from the ITB CA cache. Below you will find instructions for how to accomplish this change, how to rollback in case of errors or after the testing is complete and a short survey of the testing.

---+++ Software versions to be tested
---++++ OSG CE, WN Client, glexec
---++++ SE
   * Test srm/dcache, srm/bestman, xrootd, hadoop?
   * Need to identify production versions that are being used in the OSG and few sites that are will to test
   * Coordinate with the developers (and storage team)
      * Ask them to test all the major versions of the software that are deployed on OSG
      * Inquire if testing of minor versions are also needed
      * Record and discuss any concerns they might have. Identify any versions that might have problems and develop a plan to patch them is deemed appropriate.
      * Get developers signoff

---++++ GUMS
   * Need to identify production versions that are being used in the OSG and few sites that are will to test
   * Coordinate with the developers at BNL
      * Ask them to test all the major versions of the software that are deployed on OSG
          * Test minor versions if needed
      * Identify any versions that might have problems and develop a plan to patch them is deemed appropriate.
      * Get developers signoff
   * Do we also need to test SAZ, LCAS, LCMAPS, edg-mkgridmap etc?
