---++ Coordinating tests of new CA distribution format on production sites
%TOC%
The proposed change in the CA package due to the new layout from IGTF to accommodate openssl 1.0 is slated to go into production on OSG with the next IGTF release. The changes have already been identified in [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/SEP7][SEP7]] and implemented. However since this change affects our security infrastructure significantly the security team will like to have the changes tested on few older versions of Production sites before we roll out a production deployment. For this purposes the chosen test sites will be asked to temporarily install the CA package from the ITB CA cache. Below you will find instructions for how to accomplish this change, how to rollback in case of errors or after the testing is complete and a short survey of the testing.

---+++ Software versions to be tested
---++++ OSG CE, WN Client, glexec
Using the information on the page we have identified potential candidates for testing each of the OSG version we have deployed on production (see list of sites below). 

When possible we have tried to use sites that are running multiple versions of OSG on different CEs and those that we believe have good experience on OSG. On these sites we hope we can test the CE services, glexec and OSG_WN Client. 

   * 1.0.1(EXP) gaia.physics.mcgill.ca
   * 1.0.4(EXP) abitibi.sbgrid.org
   * 1.0.5 cunygrid.gc.cuny.edu
   * 1.2.0(EXP) cms-xen19.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.1 smuosggate.physics.smu.edu
   * 1.2.3 ce01.cmsaf.mit.edu
   * 1.2.4 ff-grid.unl.edu
   * 1.2.5 ff-grid3.unl.edu
   * 1.2.6 iut2-grid6.iu.edu
   * 1.2.7 fester.utdallas.edu
   * 1.2.8 cmsosgce.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.9 tier2-01.ochep.ou.edu
   * 1.2.10 grid1.oscer.ou.edu
   * 1.2.11 ouhep0.nhn.ou.edu
   * 1.2.13 ff-grid2.unl.edu
   * 1.2.14 gpn-husker.unl.edu
   * 1.2.15 cmsosgce3.fnal.gov

   * 1.2.17 d0cabosg1.fnal.gov
   * 1.2.18 cms-xen2.fnal.gov

As for 1.2.x sites do we need to test all sub versions or would it be ok to test a subset that had a significant change in the CE software stack.

Looking at the release notes (available 1.2.4+) it may be sufficient only to test following (1.2.4+) subversion: 1.2.4, 1.2.6, 1.2.9, 1.2.10,
1.2.14, 1.2.16, 1.2.17, 1.2.18.

   * Need testing of glexec versions deployed on production site.
      * We need to involve glexec developers to test older versions of the code
      * Has been tested on ITB

---++++ Questions for developers
   * Q1. Given the new CA format files to support openssl 1.0, how will you  expect your production software to be affected? What about the older versions of your software  that might be used on OSG, would they be affected?
   * Q2. What kind of testing would you like to conduct (and how can we help), for you to be comfortable with OSG making the switch. would it sufficient to test the oldest version used on OSG and the newest one? What are the S/W that need testing and who will be able to help with such testing?
   * Q3. Please look at the instructions I put together for site admins ([[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CADistributionFormatProductionTesting]]). These are written for the CE. Do you think it is also sufficient for testing software componanr, if not please feel free to add appropriate instruction to the twiki page. Also what kind of verification steps would we conduct to validate your software component?
   * Q4: When do they plan to make a new release?  

---+++++ Response from GUMS developer 
<verbatim>

For your Q1:

In theory, on the server side GUMS itself shouldn't be affected at all, provided its underlying platforms are updated. 
All the certificate validation is done on the gatekeeper, and calls to GUMS involve only strings. 
The SSL-protected connection to GUMS simply uses whatever SSL libraries are built into Apache or Tomcat (depending on how SSL is set up).

However, when acting as a *client* (connecting to various VOMS servers) GUMS uses the glite Trustmanager. 
This is where we could be affected, since it interacts with the CA store and validates the external connections. 
But as long as the trustmanager project is kept up, GUMS should be fine.

That said, I don't know the current status of upkeep and near-term plans for the glite Trustmanager. 
I do know that a lot of grid software is using it, and I *think* those projects still work on distributions that have moved to openssl 1.0.

I'll ask around to see if I can get solid information. Please let us know if you learn anything.

Regarding your question Q2, given that GUMS only interacts with the underlying SSL framework via 3rd-party libs, 
I don't think extensive testing is called for. It will either work completely or not at all. 
Especially since this is just about how to look up a CA/CRL, not the format itself.

Regarding Q3:
Twiki looks fine. If my answers above are right, nothing special should be needed for GUMS.


The key question: Is there a plan to *remove* the old hash values for the CA directories?
 As long as the old hash links exist, old software should work OK regardless of how it functions.

---+++ Action Plan

1. GOC will set up a new CA repository (osg-new) that will distribute
OSG CAs in the new format. This will include cache for download by
vdt-update-certs, RPM and debian packages. I am not sure if we have to
establish a new repository or just create new package for rpms and debs,
but that is something for GOC to figure out. The OSG Security team will
then be responsible to creating and maintaining the release.
POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL ITEM: Alain requested to have two additional caches
(igtf and igtf-new, which will have only IGTF CAs) so that VDT could
stop distributing CA package. I dont believe this has been decided on
and I have no strong opinions one way or another, so I will leave this
decision to Alain, Rob and Mine.
ACTION ITEM: GOC will immediately work on establishing a new CA
production cache (osg-new).

2. Need testing of vdt-update-certs, vdt-ca-manage and the RPM/deb
download mechanism with the new caches.
ACTION ITEM: After cache is established Anand will test the mechanism to
download CAs from new cache.

3. Update and validate instructions that will be sent out to sites and VOs
ACTION ITEM: Anand will prepare initial documentation for CE updates. We
will solicit help from experts to outline the steps for GUMS/SEs/VOMS
etc.. Steve, Alain, Suchandra, Marco will be our initial experts team
who will help validate and document the process.

4. Need updates to RSV CA probes, so that it can correctly handle
production CAs coming from two separate caches. Tests of the updated probe.
ACTION ITEM: Anand will update the RSV probes and release it to the ITB.
Scott will test the updated RSV probes (possibly on a production site)
and prepare documentation on how the sites may be able to update the
probes (without updating the whole CE if needed).

5. Once the CA package are ready, the production team will establish a
schedule sites/VOs to update to the new CA cache.
ACTION ITEM: Once the instructions and cache is ready Dan, Marco and
production team will contact Burt and Xin to implement the changes at
Tier 1 sites. This will include CEs, SEs, GUMS, and WNs. Basically all
the production services (except for VOMS) will be use the new CA cache.

6. Replicate this procedure on Tier 2 and other sites, till we are
confident of coverage before we announce the switch for all OSG sites.
ACTION ITEM: Decide and implement a concrete schedule and deadline for
switching all the sites. At some point in a year or so the old cache
needs to be retired and redirected to the new cache.

7. Coordinate with VOs to get their VOMS upgraded to use VOMS-Admin 2.6.
ACTION ITEM: Steve will conduct tests on the new VOMS-Admin version and
we will coordinate with VO forum and production team to roll out the
changes to all VOs.

---++++ Tasks for GOC
Following the phone conversation between Anand, Mine, Rob Q, and Scott, we have identified the following tasks for GOC.

1. Create 3 new caches in production osg-new, igtf, and igtf-new. This will be in addition to the current osg ca cache. The igtf-* caches are intended to replace the cache hosted by the VDT. The osg-new and igtf-new cache will contain the CAs in the new format. Each cache will include the CA files that could be downloaded as tarball (through vdt-update-certs), RPMs and debs packages. Rob indicated that they will mirror the setting for the itb.

2. GOC will work with OSG security team to refine the process of CA package creation specifically identifying locations in GOC's SVN repository where the new CA packages will be expected.

3. Scripts to deploy the package from SVN to the repository will be updated to account for the new packages.

The current plan is to create a new candidate release that would be ready for ITB testing on June 21, with a production release planned for June 28.
