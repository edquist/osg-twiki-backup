For the SDSC CA (b89793e4.0), from Bill Link:
<tt><pre>
Hi Doug,

	 b89793e4.0 is the NPACI/SDSC CA which is now semi-retired i.e., it
no longer issues new certificates.  A new CRL for it is issued 
immediately after a certificate is revoked and the CRL is also
updated daily in order to keep its "Last Update/Next Update"
dates fresh.  The web page for the CA can be found at
http://www.npaci.edu/CA/, the CRL is linked off the that
page as is other information for the CA.

Bill
