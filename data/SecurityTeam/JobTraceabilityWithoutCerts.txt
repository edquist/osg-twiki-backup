---+Traceability Project Plan

---++Project Definition: 

This project aims to define the job traceability requirements from the viewpoints of OSG sites and VOs. It focuses only on user jobs submitted without X.509 credentials, and presents the security requirements for tracing these jobs back to the users. The project examines whether the OSG software tools have the technical capability to meet these requirements and makes recommendations to the software team to make these tools compatible with the requirements. 

---++Project Goals: 

The goal of the project is to enable the secure execution of end user jobs without X.509 credentials.

   * Define the security requirements to trace grid jobs to users when such jobs submitted without end-user X.509 certificates.
   * Examine whether existing VO submission mechanisms can meet the requirements.
   * Recommend technical solutions and enhancements to existing software tools if they fall short of the requirements. 

---++Major Project Steps 

The job traceability requirements are described at OSG Traceability Requirements for End User Jobs without Certificates  at osg-docdb OSG-doc-1149-v1 
   1 Gather feedback from the glideinwms and condor software teams about the requirements document.
   1 Gather feedback from the VO frontend and management teams about the requirements document.
   1 Install and run a test frontend and examine how much traceability data already exists in the software stack
   1 Analyze the feedback received from the software teams and the VO staff, and identify the gaps in meeting the requirements.  
   1 Recommend technical and procedural solutions to remedy the identified gaps. 
   1 Communicate proposed solutions to software teams and the VO staff. 

---+++ Step 2. Gather feedback from VO frontend and management staff
