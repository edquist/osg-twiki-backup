---++ Project Plan for 2012 Security Drill of Glidein Framework
---+++ Problem Statement
As part of security teams activities, we periodically run so-called "Security  Drills". In this round we are targeting Glidein Framework

---+++ Goal
The objective of drill is to improve the quality of the response by glidein operators (both frontend and factory) to security incidents, in particular:

   * Compliance with the OSG Incident Response Procedure
   * Timeline and quality of the response
   * Ensuring that the operators of different components of the glidein framework understand the responsibilities to security and incident response
   * Ensuring that the incident response communication channels are  working as expected
   * Provide some hands-on experience in dealing with a (test) security incident

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand  (Lead), Mine
   * Participants: Various glidein frontend and factory operators and some Grid site admins

---+++ Deliverable from the project
   * Improve understanding of OSG Incident Response Procedure among glidein operators and sites
   * Recommendations (if any) for participating operators, sites and OSG security team
   * A report documenting the results on twiki

---+++ What will we test/learn
   * Can users be banned from glidein frontend? 
   * Can the frontend trace and stop all the jobs associated with a particular DN? Is help factory needed, and if so what is the procedure.
   * Given a particular user DN can the frontend trace all the jobs that were submitted for that DN over a specified time period and where they were run.
   * Forensic about files left and network traffic associated with a job. 
   * What would be the differences when sites use glexec and when they do not, in terms of their ability to respond to security incidents

---+++ Dependencies/ Risks
   * None

---+++ Affected Parties
