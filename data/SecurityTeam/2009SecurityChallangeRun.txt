Hello,                                                                                                        
                                                                                                              
The OSG Security Team will be conducting a Security Service Challenge                                         
(SSC) of Tier 1 sites in coordination with the EGEE/LCG Operational                                           
Security Coordination Team. Background information about SSCs is

The Security Team will submit a test job under the Test Operator's        
credentials to each site and will then send email to site security                                            
contacts requesting prompt investigation of the activities of the Test                                        
Operator at their site.

security incident to the OSG Security Team according to:

---++ Additioanl EMAIL  to be sent to recruiting sites: 


<verbatim>

Dear ,

I am contacting you on behalf of the OSG Security Team.

As part of our activities, we periodically run so-called "Security  Service Challenges (SSC)".

The objective of SSC campaigns is to improve the quality of the   
response to grid sites to security incidents, in particular:

- Compliance with the OSG Incident Response Procedure
- Timeline and quality of the response
- Ensuring that the incident response communication channels are  working as expected
- Ensuring all relevant participants are informed


More information about the challenges is available from:
####  TWIKI LINK 

We are currently preparing another SSC campaign in <MONTH><YEAR> and  
aimed at <CHALLENGED SITES LIST>.


There are several benefits to the collaborating VO:
- a better understanding of the grid incident response procedure
- a better understanding of the way communication is organised during  
incidents
- some hands-on experience in dealing with a (test) security incident
- a better view on how sites usually react, what they expect from the  
affected VO, what information they provide the VO with

Thanks in advance,
