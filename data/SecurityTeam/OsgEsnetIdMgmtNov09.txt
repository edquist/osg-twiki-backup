---+++++ Questions we are interested in.

Below is just a sample of questions to provoke our discussion

   * what are the trust models behind our models? 
      * where trust is placed in our systems? what are the untrusted components? how do they interact? 
      * what are the trust assumptions, how our system fails if an assumption is not held true
   * what are the fundamental security principles embodied in our work?
      * Many to choose from: non-repudiation, privacy, least-privilege, confidentiality, availability, confidentiality, integrity ... 
      * How these principles interact? For example, do we trade off user privacy for non-repudiation? 
     * Which access control models we are implementing? are we inventing a new model? or do we re-use an existing model?
   * What problem we are trying to solve? 
      * what are the use scenarios? 
      * what are the assumptions in the system to work? what happens if an assumptions is not held true
