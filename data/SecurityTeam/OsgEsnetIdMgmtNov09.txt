---+++ Nov. 9 (CS bldg. room 4310) Living in an Evolving Identity World

---++++ 9am - Welcome
   * Welcome, OSG Goals for today (Mine, Miron)
   * DOEGrids/ESnet goals (Mike, Bill)

Mike's synopsis of X.509, Shib and !OpenID.
<verbatim>
X.509
X.509 is typicaly used to provide authentication for identity assertions - 
for single sign-on in grids, for digital signatures.
* A standard format for packaging the public key of key pairs in a PKI
  (has nothing to say about the private key)
* X.509 describes a token, not a protocol, and is completely neutral about
  protocols
* Trust in X.509 depends on the integrity  of the associated
  private key and associated policy - and very little of that policy
  is explicit in the X.509 certificate itself.
* Standard X.509 certificate format contains various assertions about
  the key pair, including names, key usages, and other things
* The certificates are digitally signed - optimization: relying parties
  trust, and know directly, only a small number of certificate signers
  called certification authorities
* X.509 attempts to solve the authorization problem, by providing attributes,
  implicit assumptions, implicit policies, attribute certificates, and other
  techniques.  But it is now considered to be only part of the solution at best.

* Need for federation:
  ** Explicit form of policies governing issuing certificates
  ** Distribution of metadata - including the approved certification authorities
* X.509 is the foundation authentication technology for SSL/TLS
  (which is usually implemented only in the server certificate form)
* Applications do not manage private keys, but do need to store lists of
  trusted certificates

Shibboleth
Shibboleth is an implementation of SAML to support identity federations.
It is designed to solve the web single sign on problem.
* Based heavily on certain SAML profiles
* SAML has extensive security considerations and contingency planning built-in
* There is an implicit policy management issue - participants are expected to
  conform to various SAML profiles and various federation membership operational
  requirements
* Federation creates a metadata management and distribution system requirement
* Shibboleth is a real time protocol - interaction between the components should/must
   be protected with TLS (there are also digital signature requirements)
* Shibboleth uses SAML tokens (signed) as part of the message-passing
* Shibboleth attempts to solve part of the authorization problem, by passing
  a rich set of attributes between identity provider and relying party
* Shibboleth is relatively neutral about authenticators, but does not currently
  support user-level certificate authentication
* Shibboleth is web - based and perhaps web - bound (possibly true about
  SAML as well)
* Applications (services) do not store authenticator information
* Shibboleth is engineered to serve the needs of enterprise & organization federation

OpenID
OpenID is a web-url based authentication protocol.  It was designed to solve the
web single sign on problem from the point of view of Web 2.0 applications and
the user-centric view of identity.
* Well-defined urls define the content (the Openid identity, the queries, and the responses)
* Authentication of identity is the original use case.  Authorization is out of scope.
* OpenID is a realtime protocol.  However message integrity and confidentiality were out
  of scope of the original design.  SSL/TLS is essential altho not required in the spec.
* OpenID is relatively new and the specification and use cases are changing rapidly
* OpenID  is neutral about authenticators.
* Applications (services) do not store authenticator information
* OpenID was designed to be open and scale - any openid relying party could authenticate
  with any openid provider.  Federation-oriented optimizations are possible.

---++++ 9:30am - Roundtable of Id Management technologies

   * Teragrid, Shibboleth, [[http://www.cilogon.org/fed][!InCommon]], [[http://www.cilogon.org/service][CILogon]] - Jim Basney, Von Welch
   * ESG, !OpenID - Rachana Ananthakrishna
   * DOEGrids  - Policies & Trust - Dhiva
   * WLCG trends, Terena SCS - Dave Kelsey
   * X.509, HSPD-12 - John Volmer

---+++++ Questions we are interested in.

Below is just a sample of questions to provoke our discussion

   * what are the trust models behind our models? 
      * where trust is placed in our systems? what are the untrusted components? how do they interact? 
      * what are the trust assumptions, how our system fails if an assumption is not held true
   * what are the fundamental security principles embodied in our work?
      * Many to choose from: non-repudiation, privacy, least-privilege, confidentiality, availability, confidentiality, integrity ... 
      * How these principles interact? For example, do we trade off user privacy for non-repudiation? 
     * Which access control models we are implementing? are we inventing a new model? or do we re-use an existing model?
   * What problem we are trying to solve? 
      * what are the use scenarios? 
      * what are the assumptions in the system to work? what happens if an assumptions is not held true

---+++++ Interesting Questions
  
   * What are the VO computing models/policies?
      * trust model, usage policies, etc? how they are limited by (or lack thereof) security
      * how VO decides their computing policy? is there a dedicated body?
   * User issues, needs, and wishes
      * why? is it really a need/issue, OR is it a symptom of another underlying issue, or a particular technology or mis-use policy ...
   * VO managers issues, needs and wishes  
      * why?
      * are they any different than user issues? 
   * any SITE related problems now or foreseen in future?
      * lack of dedicated resources? 
   * Where will the VO be in next 5 years, 10 years? 
      * computational and data needs/restrictions ? 
      * growth of the community ?
      * new processing needs and applications, gateways, portals ?
      * resource usage
   * what are today's most immediate problems? 
      * What was your VO's most immediate problem 5 years ago today?
      * What will be the most immediate problems on this day 5 years later?
