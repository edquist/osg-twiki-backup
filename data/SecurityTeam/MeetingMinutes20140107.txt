   * Confirmed with David Groep that the old-format release had the wrong has filename for the SEE-GRID VO. He suggested just renaming it. I'm guessing we should go ahaed and release updated old/compat packages.
   * Need to revisit retiring the old format releases, as IGTF doesn't want to do it anymore.
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Requested meeting with CTA VO.
   * Certificate Free submission newsletter article was accepted. Still not getting newsletters so far. Was there one in December before the break?
   * High Priority. Start January 1st. Will evaluate security of perfSonar test box at GOC and the perfSonar dashboard.
   * High Priority. Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0 after New Year.

   * Yesterday (Mon Jan 6) Anand and Mine discussed the details on deprecating the old CA format since IGTF will stop producing them.
   * Had a discussion with CHTC team before the holidays. The architecture at CHTC has a frontend (FE) node that accepts flocked jobs from submit nodes. The FE then submits jobs to OSG factory at both GOC and SDSC. Few of the submit nodes are managed by CHTC team while others are managed by individual PIs/admins. For nodes managed by CHTC there is a formal registration process for the users but for nodes maintained by individual PIs there is no such guarantees. Based on this discussion we decided that only jobs submitted to CHTC nodes might be submitted to FNAL. 
      * Two approaches were discussed to achieve this: 1) set up an new FE that accepts jobs only from CHTC; and 2) configure the FE in such a way that only jobs that are flocked from trusted CHTC nodes may be submitted to FNAL.
      * High Priority: Develop a twiki page with the information gathered from CHTC
      * Setup a security drill with CHTC to see if they can trace the jobs back to the submit node that it was flocked from. 
   * Medium priority: Help Mine with preparing a news article to reduce the use of certificates for worker nodes in OSG
