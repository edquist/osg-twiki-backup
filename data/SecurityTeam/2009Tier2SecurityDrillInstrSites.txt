---++ Security Drill Instructions for Sites _ Tier 2 Drills

---+++On the Drill Day	


On the scheduled drill date, the Security Team will submit a test job under a Test Operator's credentials to your site. We will give you the identity of the test operator (the Distinguished Name in his/her certificate). The test operator and the test job will be assumed as malicious. the security team will then send email to site security contacts requesting prompt investigation of the activities of the Test Operator at their site.

Sites are requested to follow normal security incident response procedures.

*In particular: following steps are expected to be taken*

   1. The security team will send an alert email to site security contacts. The email subject line will contain [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL]. This marks the beginning of the drill.
   2. Site contacts should send an immediate reply to security@opensciencegrid.org confirming they received the email alert. Sites will be graded based on how quickly they replied.
   3. Sites must include [THIS IS A SECURITY DRILL] in ALL of their email subject lines.
   4. Sites immediately start their investigation on the incident. At every step, sites should send email updates to the security team email address directly (osg-security-team@opensciencegrid.org)
   5. Find the test process and kill them. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this step.
   6. Ban the test user from submitting additional jobs. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.  
   7. Discover the incoming IP address of the test process. Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.
   8. Do an analysis of the network traffic (broader the better: there will be bonus points). Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.
   9. Do an analysis of submitted binaries (there will be bonus point) . Email the security team with details when accomplishing this.

Please note that No sanctions must be applied against the Virtual Organization (VO) that was used to submit the job. 

---+++ After the Drill	

   1. You should restore access to the banned test operator.
   2. The test job will not cause any harm, but If you have encounter any trouble restoring your system, contact us.
   3. If you have trouble killing the test job,it is configured to restore to remove all traces of itself after 72 hours.


---+++ What We Most Care About	

   1. How fast they respond to the incident alerts
   2. How quickly and how well they are able to accomplish steps 2-9.
