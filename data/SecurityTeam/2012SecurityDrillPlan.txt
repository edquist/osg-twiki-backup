---++ Challenge Procedure

   * The test operator (TOP) warns the registered security contact of the site about the upcoming challenge.
   * The TOP submits a job to the site using an predetermined identity that will be in MIS VO.
   * The TOP informs the site security contact that this identity should be treated as malicious and the normal OSG incident response procedure should be followed (with some caveats).
   * The TOP measures the quality of the response of the site based on an existing set of criteria.
   * The drill is intended to educate and inform the admins of smaller sites about OSG security procedures and best practices. No formal scoring is planned however based on quality of the response feedback will be provided to sites to help improve their responses when handling real incidents.
   * The tests will follow a patten similar to the drills conducted earlier against [[2009TierSecurityChallengePlan][Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites]].


---++ Questions and Concerns

   * What do we need done prepare for challenge ? 
      * Do we need to getting a special certificate/credential ? 
      * Get that certificate to MIS VO
   * What all information would they provide in their notification ? 
   * What kind of data/results they expect from sites ?  
   * Will there be any differences in the way we handle old (pacman based) v/s new (rpm based) CE installation\
      *  For example the location of log files might be different. Do we provide them with separate instructions?
   * How do they rate sites 
      * Since many of T3 sites have only part time admins, what will be our expectations from the sites
   * How do they define the end of challenge ? 
      * what all sites need to do to be able to say challenge is finished ?
