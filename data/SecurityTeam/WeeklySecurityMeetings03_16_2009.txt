Aashish
security challenge. ready to run the challenge. ran in Anand's testbed. job would not run . submit to condor-g. 
took Sven's code but Sven's wrote against WMS. how much time for announcement. deadline? april 10th? 
ask Romain on the deadline.  we are emailing the sites today. before lunch time. 
Aashish will run the jobs agains Fnal and BNL. aashish will post the evaluation criteria. 
fnal requires voms proxy and bnl does not. 
check with BNL and FNAL if tomorrow is allright. 

Anand: 
RSV probes are done. implemented the handshake probe. does not check whether handshake runs successfully. it checks the frequency. 
GUMS does not have frequency the probe. what does Jay's probe really implement? 
CA supported VO is completed. Arvind changed the RSV library. this was planned and needed for the RSV probes. Anand must change his probes to make sure the new library will work. Anand will complete the work by the end of the week.  

vdt-ca-manage. probably in Monday release. 

MITM attacks against GUMS. EGEE libraries and Jay opened a GGUs ticket. opened a ticket for edg-mkgridmap. 
if we are concerned about MITM , we should look at vdt-update-cert script. 
gLite rated it as low priority. Jim agrees. edg tries a ssl handshake. 
gums does authN. but not doing the authZ of VOMS server. 

Jim: 
DOEgrid identity mgmt workshop. whether it is OSG workshop or ESNet workshop.

hardware tokens are the only better solution.
