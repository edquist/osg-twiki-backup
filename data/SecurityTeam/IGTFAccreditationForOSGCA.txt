---++ OSG CA IGTF Accreditation Process

This website serves a hub for all documentation related to OSG CA's IGTF Acceditation Process. It inlcudes process flowcharts, plans, CP/CPS statements and so on that is necessary for the approval process. 

OSG CA has always provided IGTF accredited certificates to its community. Although the CA itself has not gone through the accreditation process, it has worked with backend CA providers who had the accreditation. OSG CA's transition to work with CILogon HSM, which does not have accreditation, forces OSG to seek an accreditation of its CA services.
