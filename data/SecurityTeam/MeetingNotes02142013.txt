---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * We got a new Pakiti software release from European software developers. Kevin started playing with the new version. But we will continue to publicize the current version that we put into VDT. 
      * Setting up the demo system for ahm pakiti demo. 
      * will talk to Jemise to send out a newsletter article. 
      * send an email to osg-sites that this is available. 
   * Fermilab PKI. testing glexec and gums with various different test combintaion to find out any new bugs. java 7 with tomcat rpm should also be tested with proxies. 
   * SHA-2 transition in Auguts. It is a good idea for osg software to start reminding sites to upgrade to software versions that works with SHA-2. It will take a long time until sites complete their upgrade. 


*Anand*
   * Condor vulnerability tickets. Opened 3 more tickets but 2 are closed. We have 3 open tickets (Clemson, Bellarmine, star-bnl). Ran the scipts over again the sites that they failed before but script did not run again. These sites that scripts do not run:  FNAL_CDFOSG_1, FNAL_DZEROOSG_1, FNAL_FERMIGRID, FNAL_GPGRID_1. Kevin and Mine will contact these sites to verify their patch level. Anand will work with the remaining sites that scripts did not run. 
   * IGTF release is fine. 
   * Risk assessment. osg 1.2 grid-proxy-init creating an md5 proxy. it does not change with the input user cert, it always creates the md5. osg pacman is supported until the end of May. Now osg 3.x is supported. 
      * Could not find any practical epxloit for sha-1 collision. all attack scenarios are theoretical. 
      * create a twiki page. 
   * Not yet contacted Marco Slyz for access to osg vo frontend.
