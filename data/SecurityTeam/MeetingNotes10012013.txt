*Kevin*:
   * Asked Mats to create an account for me on osg-xsede. Will do a traceability test for Fermi once it is set up to start sending jobs to Fermilab without glexec.
   * Cleaned up some old notification tickets.
   * Reviewed ORNL RA approval process. Pretty straightforward. I don't think there's anything else security is required to do in this process.
   * Submitted abstract for talk on osg authentication evolution for hepix.

*Anand*:
