---++ Defining a Joint Work Plan between OSG and ESNet for Doug's Effort

The goal of this meeting is to identify the mutual work items that are deemed high priority by both OSG and ESNet. Doug's effort is divided up 50-50 between ESNet and OSG Security teams. By creating a unified work plan, we will make sure his work would be more consistent and efficient for both parties. 

We will meet quarterly to review the work plan and assess the progress.

   * Doug is currently working on Shib-consuming CA. That is why he came to ShibFest in Chicago.

   * RA Agent guide from the CA software point of view. 
   * A test environment for approving and mandating changes. 
   * Testing the Registration Manager (the new software) to understand how will it fit into the new registration process

   * There are problems related to the user-interface of the DOEgrids CA services. ESNet hired an external design team to work on ESnet website. Mike will check whether efforts available to help with DOEGrids CA website. Although he is skeptical.  
  
*%BLUE%Mine%ENDCOLOR%*: 

   * Doug's highest priority is to get our ITB test cache up and running for testing certificates. 
   * The second priority is to understand and re-design the registration flow. 
   * His ongoing work is to monitor the RA infrastructure and make sure the agent behavior complies with OSG and ESNet policies. 
   * Mitigation of security risks caused by lack of privilege separation between the agents. A agent can revoke any other certificates. 
   * certificate management tool for the users. the tool would help with the certificate retrieval and renewal. Also, it would help with managing the certificates on the browser.
