   * I requested the Scientific Linux team to help us replace old kx509 rpms with new ones, and they want me to organize a meeting including all stakeholders.
   * The Globus Auth meeting with Steve Tuecke went well, but switching to Oauth2 is a long term project and it's unclear whether or not OSG will end up using Globus Auth.
   * Singularity on EL6 cannot see new /cvmfs mounts that are added after it starts.  If the pilot is able to know which repositories the job is going to access, it could make sure they're mounted before starting singularity.  Other than that there doesn't appear to be a workaround.  Singularity also appears to make sure that cvmfs repositories stay mounted as long as it is running.

   * Vulnerability reported in Linux kernel: A 'use after free' vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg subsystem. This may allow a local root exploit and potentially also remote arbitrary code execution. https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/31838
   * OpenSSL published new release that fixes some vulnerabilities; one rated as High: TLS connections using a specific set of ciphersuites are susceptible to a DoS attack by corrupting larger payloads. This can result in an OpenSSL crash. This issue is not considered to be exploitable beyond a DoS.
      * This does NOT affect Red Hat systems
      * No current Linux distributions include OpenSSL 1.1.0 yet, so only systems with custom/manual installations of OpenSSL 1.1.0 are impacted.
   * Working on Computer Security Awareness Day slides and trifold card.
   * Working on Risk Assessment 2016.
