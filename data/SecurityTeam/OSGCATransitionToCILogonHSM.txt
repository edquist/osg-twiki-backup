---++ OSG CA Backend Transition to CILogon HSM 
---+++Scope and Goals
OSG CA has two components: a fronted that provides the user interface and manages the certificate workflow; and a backend CA provider that cryptographically signs the certificate requests. Currently the DigiCert CA provides the backend services. The goal of this transition project is to move the backend services from DigiCert CA to CILogon HSM.
