---+ Central RSV Security Probes 
%TOC%

The Central RSV probes will be run by GOC and will monitor the status of the CAs and CRLs being distributed by both OSG and VDT. In addition to checking the contents of the CAs and CRLs distributed by OSG and VDT these probes will also monitor the distribution process or the update mechanisms used by the OSG.


---++ Distribution process verification probes 
The high level goal of the distribution process verification probes is to check OSG provided CA and CRL distribution mechanisms including 
   1. vdt-update-certs
   1. yum update
   1. fetch-crl
are available and functioning correctly. Both the vdt-update-certs and yum update probes should be deployed to run against both the VDT and GOC cache.

---+++ Probe to test vdt-update-certs

*Probe Name*: cacert-process-vdtupdate-central-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.cacert.process.vdt-update-certs <br>
*Parameters* :--warning-hours \<hours\>, --error-hours \<hours\> <br>
    =--error-hours=:  Number hours since the failing downloads before an error is issued <br>
    =--warning-hours=:  Number hours since the failing downloads before a warning is issued <br>
   (Default Values: 3 days and 1 day respectively). <br>

For all probes the parameters described here are in addition to the usual rsv-probe parameters (e.g. =--vdt-location=).

---++++ !!Description
This probe check the process of downloading the certs using vdt-update-certs. This probe invokes =vdt-update-certs --force= with other appropriate parameters. It will capture the exitcode and out resulting from the execution of this command and will populate the result in RSV. Additionally this probe also checks the status file maintained by vdt-update-certs  (=vdt/var/certs-updater-status=) to figure out when was the last time the probe executed successfully.

---++++!! Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If 1.) vdt-update-certs exits with a non-zero exit code; 2.) last successful run as recorded in =certs-updater-status= is greater than 'error-hours' old; or 3.) vdt-update-certs or its status file is missing.
   * *warning*: If last successful run as recorded in =certs-updater-status= is greater than 'warn-hours' old, but no critical error is detected.
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++!! Deployment recommendation
We will recommend GOC deploy this probe against both the VDT and OSG cache. This can be done by installing multiple instances of vdt-update-certs package and setting the cacerts_url in one to point to OSG while the other points to the vdt distribution.  The location of the instance to be used may be passed to the probe using the =--vdt-location=.

---+++ Probe to test yum-update

*Probe Name*: cacert-process-yumupdate-central-probe
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.cacert.process.yum-update
*Parameters* :--install-dir \<directory\>. <br>
     =--install-dir= is a required parameter specifying the location of the local yum installation directory. This parameter specifies the root directory of the local yum installation that will be just used for RSV tests. <br>
---++++!! Description
This probe is designed to check the process of downloading the certs using yum update. There is an extra complication in the process yum update process can only be run as root. So this RSV prove running as an 'rsvuser' will be unable to actually execute yum update and get the results. In order to over come this problem we wrote a shell script rsv_yum_update_cron.sh, that can be put into the roots crontab. This cron job does an =yum update= on the local yum installation and records the results in =rsv-test-yumupdate= directory within the local installtion. This captures 1.) the stdout and stderr ($local-yum-install/rsv-test-yumupdate/output); and 2.) the exit code ($local-yum-install/rsv-test-yumupdate/status) from the execution on =yum update= as well as the time when the update of last run ($local-yum-install/rsv-test-yumupdate/lastrun).

---++++!! Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If a non-zero exit code is recoded in status file.
   * *unknown* : If any of the output, status or lastrun files are missing.
   * *ok*: All other cases.

---++++!! Deployment recommendation
We will recommend GOC deploy this probe against both the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/certificate_authorities.html#rpm][VDT YUM repo]] and OSG one. 

In addition to following the instruction at [[http://yum.grid.iu.edu/]] for setting up a yum repository, here are the steps we went through to establish the local yum install that contained the  osg-ca-certs.
<verbatim>
mkdir /root/my_yum_local
mkdir -p /root/my_yum_local/var/lock/rpm/
touch /root/my_yum_local/var/lock/rpm/transaction
yum install osg-ca-certs --installroot /root/my_yum_local -y
</verbatim>

All the above commands were run as root. Steps 2 & 3 above (mkdir and touch command) were needed (atleast on our SL4 install yum version 2.4.3) to create the lock file that is needed by yum to do a local install. 

After the yum installation you will also need to add the rsv_yum_update_cron.sh in  your cron
<verbatim>
30 * * * * /etc/osg/osg-rsv/bin/probes/rsv_yum_update_cron.sh -l /root/my_yum_local
</verbatim>

---+++ Probe to test fetch-crl

*Probe Name*:  crl-process-fetchcrl-central-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.crl.process.fetchcrl <br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\><br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files <br>
   (Default Value:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA). <br>

---++++!! Description
This probe checks the process of downloading the CRLs using fetchCRL. It invokes fetch CRL with appropriate parameter and captures its output and exit code.

---++++!! Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If fetch-crl file is missing.
   * *warning*: If fetch-crl exits with a non-zero exit code. We produce warning instead of error, because there are usually transient which may cause one of the CRL to fail update and we don't want an error for that case. In order to capture cases where the failures are persistent we have a crl freshness probe (cacert-crl-freshness-centralized-probe), that will issue a warning and error, if a crl has not been updated a certain period of time. 
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++!! Deployment recommendation

We only need one deployment of the fetch-crl probe, we recommend establishing it against the CAs from the OSG cache since the CAs included in the OSG package are a superset of what is distributed by the VDT. 

---+++ Probe to test freshness of the CRLs 

*Probe Name*:  crl-freshness-central-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.crl.freshness <br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\> --warning-hours \<hour\>, --error-hours \<hours\> <br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files <br>
    =--error-hours=:  Number hours since the failing downloads before an error is issued <br>
    =--warning-hours=:  Number hours since the failing downloads before a warning is issued <br>
   (Default Values:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA, 2 days and 9 hrs respectively). <br>

---++++!! Description
This probe checks the last time when the CRLs were successfully downloaded. If any of the CRLs have not been updated for 9 hrs (warning-hours) the probe will issue a warning. This will be escalated to a critical error if a CRL has not updated for 48 Hrs (error-hours). This probe is intended to capture cases where the for any reason the CRLs of any CA were not updated. 

---++++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If any CRL files in CA directory have not been updated for 48 (error-hours) hours
   * *warning*: If any CRL files in CA directory have not been updated for 9 (warning-hours) hours
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++ !! Deployment recommendation
We will recommend deploying this probe against the same CA directory used by 'cacert-crl-fetchcrl-centralized-probe' probe.

We will also recommend using the same probe (with possibly different default values) for site-level CRL probe.


---+++ Probe to test VOMS server

*Probe Name*:  cacert-verify-voms-central-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.verify.voms<br>
*Parameters*: None <br>

---++++!! Description
This probe checks if the list of DNs can be downloaded from the VOMS server. For each VO the probe runs edg-mkdripmap to contact the VOMS server and checks if the download completes successfully. If the download fails the probe turns critical and records the error returned by edg-mkgridmap.

---++++!! Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If download of the DN list from any of the VO failed.
   * *unknown*: if edg-mkgridmap.conf  or /edg-mkgridmap.pl does not exist.
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++!! Deployment recommendation

We will just recommend once instance of this probe tunning centrally at the GOC.

---++ Content verification probes 
The high level goal of these probes is to ensure that the CAs and CRLs distributed by OSG/VDT are valid and match are in sync with IGTF. These test are designed so that the OSG security team can identify and resolve potential problems. (For e.g the security team will know if a CA or CRL is close to expiry and take proactive action to work with the CA to resolve it.)

---+++ Probe to test for the expiry of CA certificates

*Probe Name*: cacert-expiry-central-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.cacert.expiry <br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\>, --warning-hours \<hour\> <br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files <br>
    =--warning-hours=:   Number hours before certificate expiry a warning should be issued <br>
   (Default Values:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA and 14 days respectively). <br>

---++++!! Description
This probe  verifies all the CAs in the certificate directory, to make sure that the certificates there are not expired or about to expire. This probe run =openssl= commands against the certificate to make sure the certificate is valid. It also looks at the expiry dates on the certificate and issues a warning if a certificate is about to expire in 14 days (warning-hours). 

---++++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If any CA 1.) fails =openssl verify=; or 2.) has passed expiry date (Note: 2 => 1)
   * *warning*: If any CA is about to expire with in the next 14 days (warnhing-hours).
  * *unknown*: If the certificate directory specified does not exist
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++ !! Deployment recommendation
Ideally we will recommend deploying this probe against the all CA directories the 'cacert-process-vdtupdatecerts-centralized-probe' and 'cacert-process-yumupdate-centralized-probe' process probes are downloading certificates. At the very least we should deploy this probe against CAs coming from both the OSG and VDT cache.

We will also recommend providing this probe to site-level to verify their CA installation, but this probe should not be counted for 'Availability' purposes.


---+++ Probe to test for the expiry of CRLs issued by CA

*Probe Name*:  crl-expiry-central-probe<br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.crl.expiry <br>
*Parameters* :--cacerts-dir \<directory\>, --warning-hours \<hour\> <br>
    =--cacerts-dir=:      Location of CA certificate files <br>
    =--warning-hours=:   Number hours before certificate expiry a warning should be issued <br>
    =--short-warning-hours=:   Number hours before certificate expiry a warning should be issued for Short lived CRLs (CRLs that have a life time less than warning-hours)
   (Default Values:  $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA, 3 days and 12 hours respectively).<br> 

---++++!! Description
This probe  verifies all the CRLs present in the certificate directory, to make sure that the certificates there are not expired or about to expire. This probe run =openssl= commands against the certificate to make sure the certificate is valid. It also looks at the expiry dates on the CRL and issues an error if CRL has already expired and a warning if it is about to expire in 3 days (warning-hours). We also have a special case for short lived CRLs (CRLs that have a life time less than warning-hours)). For e.g. Purdue CA issues CRL that only lasts for 36 hrs, so this CRL will always generate a warning, to mitigate this problem for short lived CRLs we have a different threshold for warning generation (short-warning-hours (defaults to 24 Hrs))

---++++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If any CRL 1.) fails =openssl crl= verify command; or 2.) has passed expiry date 
   * *warning*: If any CRL is about to expire with in the next 3 days (warning-hours) (24 Hrs (short-warning-hours) for short lived CRLs)
  * *unknown*: If CRL for a particular CA is missing.
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++ !! Deployment recommendation
We will recommend deploying this probe against the same directory used by the 'cacert-crl-fetchcrl-central-probe' probe to download CRLs. 

This probe may also be provided as site-level to verify their CRLs, but this probe should not be counted for 'Availability' purposes.


---+++ Probe to test OSG and VDT tarball and RPMs against the IGTF latest tarball

*Probe Name*:cacert-verify-igtf-central-probe  <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.cacert.verify.igtf <br>
*Parameters* :--igtf-tar \<URL\>, -osg-tar \<URL\>. -vdt-tar \<URL\>, -osg-rpm \<URL\>, -vdt-rpm \<URL\> <br>
    --igtf-tar \<URL\>       Location of CA certificate tarball distributed by IGTF. (Default: http://dist.eugridpma.info/distribution/igtf/current/accredited) <br>
    --osg-tar \<URL\>      Location of CA certificate tarball distributed by OSG. (Default: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version) <br>
    --vdt-tar \<URL\>       Location of CA certificate tarball distributed by VDT. (Default: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/software/certificates/vdt-igtf-ca-certs-version) <br>
    --osg-rpm \<URL\>       Location of CA certificate RPMs distributed by OSG. (Default: http://yum.grid.iu.edu/rpms/noarch) <br>
    --vdt-rpm \<UR\L>       Location of CA certificate RPMs distributed by VDT. (Default: http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/vdt_rpms/vdt-ca-certs) <br>

   * Please use the default values for the parameters unless you are absolutely certain*

---++++!! Description
This probe is designed to verify the tarballs and RPMs distributed by OSG and VDT against the latest tarball from IGTF. This probe downloads the latest IGTF tarball, OSG CA tarball, VDT CA tarball, OSG CA RPMs and VDT CA RPMs for their respective web sites and does the comparison using md5sums. If a IGTF certificate is missing from the distribution a warning is issued, an error is issued if the md5sums dont match.

---++++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If 1.) any CA for OSG/VDT distribution has a different md5sum than the corresponding certificate file in IGTF; 2.) any of distribution tarballs/rpms could not be correctly downloaded
   * *warning*: If a file included in IGTF is missing from OSG/VDT distribution
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++ !! Deployment recommendation
We will just recommend once instance of this probe tunning centrally at the GOC.


---+++ Probe to test if the VOs are using CAs that are not present in the OSG CA distribution

*Probe Name*: cacert-verify-dn-central-probe <br>
*Metrics*: org.osg.central.cacert.verify.dn <br>
*Parameters* :---cacerts-dir \<directory\>, -osg-tar \<URL\><br>
   --osg-tar \<URL\>: Location of CA certificate tarball distributed by OSG.
   --cacerts-dir: Location of CA certificate files <br>
  (Default: http://software.grid.iu.edu/pacman/cadist/ca-certs-version, $VDT_LOCATION'/globus/TRUSTED_CA) 

---++++!! Description
This probe is designed to verify if the CA certificates distributed by the OSG distribution contain all the CAs needed by the VOs. In order to perform this test, the probe uses a complete gridmap file generated by running edg-mkdridmap with the default configuration from osg-vo package. For each DN present in the grid mapfile it checks the signing policy of the CAs in the OSG distribution to verify if the CA need by this DN is present. If no matching CA is found, then the probe will issue an error. It will print the offending DN name along with the VO VOMS server it came from.

---++++ !!Results
The probe will produce: 
   * *critical error*: If 1.) the no matching CA certificate is found in OSG distribution for a user DN ; 2.) OSG distribution tarballs/rpms could not be correctly downloaded
   * *ok*: All other cases

---++++ !! Deployment recommendation
We will just recommend once instance of this probe tunning centrally at the GOC.
