**************************************************
[1] Service: unknown (9443/tcp), Risk: LOW
**************************************************

Synopsis :

The remote service supports the use of weak SSL ciphers.

Description :

The remote host supports the use of SSL ciphers that
offer either weak encryption or no encryption at all.

See also :

http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html

Solution :

Reconfigure the affected application if possible to avoid use of
weak ciphers.

Risk factor :

Low / CVSS Base Score : 2
(AV:R/AC:L/Au:NR/C:P/A:N/I:N/B:N)

Plugin output :

Here is a list of the SSL ciphers supported by the remote server :

Null Ciphers (no encryption)
SSLv3
NULL-MD5 Kx=RSA Au=RSA
Enc=None Mac=MD5

Medium Strength Ciphers (>= 56-bit and < 112-bit key)
SSLv3
DES-CBC-SHA Kx=RSA Au=RSA
Enc=DES(56) Mac=SHA1

High Strength Ciphers (>= 112-bit key)
SSLv3
DES-CBC3-SHA Kx=RSA Au=RSA
Enc=3DES(168) Mac=SHA1
RC4-MD5 Kx=RSA Au=RSA
Enc=RC4(128) Mac=MD5
RC4-SHA Kx=RSA Au=RSA
Enc=RC4(128) Mac=SHA1

The fields above are :

{OpenSSL ciphername}
Kx={key exchange}
Au={authentication}
Enc={symmetric encryption method}
Mac={message authentication code}
{export flag}

---++ OSG and Globus Responses

---+++Globus and VDT

It is using weak ciphers, and it doesn't matter at all.

Here is a response from Globus. It was drafted by Von Welch. I edited it slightly to be more formal, and he approved my edits.

------------------------------
It is not a concern that the Globus web container allows weak
ciphers because the Globus Toolkit has modes of operation that do
not encrypt sessions. In some cases, this is for performance
reasons. Unlike standard web sites, none of the Globus Toolkit
security relies on encrypted network connections--i.e. no secrets
(passwords, private keys) go over the wire. Integrity protection of
network traffic is important, but not encryption/privacy.

Therefore, if Nessus reports a low security risk from the Globus
container due to the use of weak ciphers, you may ignore it: there
is no security risk from the use of weak ciphers.

Dear GOC,

Please pass the following information onto BNL.  Our opinion is that
detailed examination of the application shows that service in question is
secure.
