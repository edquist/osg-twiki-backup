*Software*: !MySQL on SL5
<br>
*Severity*: High
<br>
*Summary*: Red Hat and Scientific Linux has released a security update for a vulnerability in the version of !MySQL 5.0 distributed with EL5, however it is a !MySQL 5.5 release in a Software Collection, not a direct upgrade from the 5.0 version. Databases will first need to be migrated from 5.0 to SC 5.1, then again to the final SC 5.5 version.

This particular set of vulnerabilities can be mitigated by controlling network access to known trusted clients via firewall.
