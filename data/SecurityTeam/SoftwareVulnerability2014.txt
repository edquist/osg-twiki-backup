*Software*: SSLv3
<br>
*Severity*: Low
<br>
*Summary*: A flaw has been discovered in the SSLv3 protocol that can allow an
attacker with network access to decrypt SSLv3 encrypted traffic. Web
services using usernames/passwords or cookie based session tokens are
particularly vulnerable. It does not appear that client
certificates/keys are able to be compromised.

*Software*: Bash
<br>
*Severity*: Medium
<br>
*Summary*: A flaw was discovered in the way bash processes environment variables
that allows the passing of arbitrary code to be executed. This is
extremely important for systems where unauthenticated users can submit
input that is processed by bash scripts, but could also be used for a
local privilege escalation in the case of root owned bash scripts
processing authenticated user input.

<br>
*Software*: !MySQL on SL5
<br>
*Severity*: High
<br>
*Summary*: Red Hat and Scientific Linux has released a security update for a vulnerability in the version of !MySQL 5.0 distributed with EL5, however it is a !MySQL 5.5 release in a Software Collection, not a direct upgrade from the 5.0 version. Databases will first need to be migrated from 5.0 to SC 5.1, then again to the final SC 5.5 version.

This particular set of vulnerabilities can be mitigated by controlling network access to known trusted clients via firewall.
