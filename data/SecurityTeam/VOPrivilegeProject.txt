---++ VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Privilege Project

The <b>VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Privilege Project</b> is developing and implementing finer-grained authorization for access to grid-enabled resources and services in order to improve user account assignment and management at grid sites, and reduce the associated administrative overhead.

   * [[%ATTACHURL%/user-group-mapping-doc-v3.pdf][Enforcement of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo and Grid-level Policy with Standard POSIX Semantics]]<br> In this document we will discuss an approach to leverage standard POSIX operating system mechanisms to reflect and enforce high-level policy rules. An example is given how the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo policy rules required by the U.S. CMS grid collaboration can be enforced through the novel use of existing operating system security semantics based on the POSIX recommendations. Implications of this approach with respect to the management of operating system user and group semantics and their use in cluster environments are also discussed. 

   * [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/voprivilege/documents/transition-to-privilege.html][Transition to Role-based Assignment of Local User-Ids]]<br> This document is intended as a high-level overview and transition guideline for OpenScienceGrid sites wishing to employ improved access-control mechanisms for their Grid resources based on the mechanisms made available by the Privilege Project.

   * [[https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-security/tg-policy/vo-privilege/saml-with-obligations][Use of XACML Obligations in SAML Authorization Decision Statments]]<br> This document discusses how the Authorizaiton components developed as part of the Privilege Project for !OpenScienceGrid extend SAML Authorization Decision Statements with obligation constructs. Obligations are used to provision additional decision qualifications, such as what local user account to use for the requested access, from a policy decision point to the policy enforcement point. The system utilizes the XACML obligation format.

   * [[https://plone3.fnal.gov/opensciencegrid/techgroups/tg-security/tg-policy/vo-privilege/c-programmers-guide][Privilege Project C Programmer's Guide]]<br> This document contains a description of the PRIMA module code and the components it depends on. It also provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a new PRIMA release, build it on the FNAL as well as the VDT/NMI machines. Several detailed examples on how to debug the distrinct pieces of the PRIMA module are given.
