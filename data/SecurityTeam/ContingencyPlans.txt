---++Contingency Plans

---+++Compromise of GOC CA cache
Risk scenario: GOC CA cache becomes compromised, or unreachable or unfunctional. 
Effect to OSG community: Within 24 hours, vdt-update-certs script will start failing due to unreachable CA cache. After the first failure, vdt-update-cert will run at every hour and fail until GOC cache becomes operational again. 
RSV probe to test site CA certs will fail UNLESS the md5sums file list at GOC is still available. The CA freshness probe only uses a list of md5sums of CA certs and each site's local list is compared against the list at GOC. We use the list because some sites uses rpms, or other means to retrieve the certificates. 

Contingency Plan: Security team WILL have a local copy of latest CA distribution package. When GOC CA cache gets compromised or becomes unusable, security team's copy of CA bundle will be used to distribute the CA certs. The new CA bundle will be deployed at VDT CA cache. for a short while, VDT will serve the OSG community until GOC recovers. the RSV probe that checks CA certs will FAIL because the probe checks local CA files md5sums against the md5sums file that is maintained at the GOC. The md5sum file at GOC should be moved with the CA bundle. 

We maintain CA-list-per-VO at GOC. This list is used to test whether a site claiming to support a VO indeed supports the CAs used by the VO. This is not urgent to move but it is useful to
