---++ Workflow steps

   1. _Subscriber_ requests a personal certificate, using web browser or a script interface to the Registration Manager (RM)
   2. The RM sends email acknowledgement of the request to the subscriber and a notice of the request to all _Agents_. The email notice to _Agents_ contains the name of the VO (or institution) selected by the _subscriber_.
   3. An _Agent_ for the specified VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo views the request web page and takes assignment of this request if they can process it.  Using the information provided for name, email address and phone numbers for _subscriber_ and _sponsor_ the _Agent_ determines one or more valid _Sponsors_ who may be able to confirm the request.  
   4. The _Agent_ contacts the _sponsor_ by telephone or email to ask for confirmation of the certificate request.
      a. _Agent_ looks up approved _sponsor_ for this request based on specified institution or VO.
      a. Email to _Sponsor_, or telephone to _Sponsor_ providing details about request and asking for confirmation.
      a. _Sponsor_ makes direct contact with _subscriber_ to verify the certificate request.
      a. _Subscriber_ acknowledges or disavows having made the request.
      a. _Sponsor_ conveys result from _subscriber_ back to _Agent_ by digitally signed email.
   5. _Agent_ approves or rejects the request via web interface to RM.
   6. If approved, the RM sends the certificate signing request (CSR) to the CA for signing.
   7. The CA signs the request and returns the signed certificate to the RM.
   8. The RM notifies the _subscriber_ that certificate has been issued and provides URL for downloading the certificate.
   9. The CA publishes the signed certificate into the ldap directory along with initial information specifed in request about the sponsor and affiliation.
   1. _Agent_ records information about processing the request for future reference.
