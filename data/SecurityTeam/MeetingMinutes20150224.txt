   * Lenovo adware issue interesting, doesn't affect OSG directly.
   * Thinking about what to do for All Hands Meeting.
   * Was able to get digicert-grid sha2 intermediate test ca to work for submitting jobs to SL6 CA. SL5 CA had java related issues. Don't believe its due to the certificates, but trying to fix the problem to say for sure.
   * Need to finish and test VOMS tool to add extra DNs for new CA.

   * Created the IGTF CA release, need to test it.
   * Finalized recommendation for changes in gideinwms/glexec for facilitating user traceability and protecting glidein logs on the worker nodes during execution.
