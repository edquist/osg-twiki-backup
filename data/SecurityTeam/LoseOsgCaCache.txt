---++! Contingency Plan on loss of OSG CA distribution cache repository

%TOC%

*Plan Status* - This is the basic idea.  More details are to be filled in.

---+++ Background

The OSG distributes a package of CA information. See [[ReleaseDocumentation.CADistribution][CA Distribution]].

---+++ Mitigation Plan

If the server at the GOC hosting the CA package goes down we should tell people to direct their
CA updater to the VDT CA package cache.

---+++ Recovery Plan

Talk to GOC and verify when CA cache is functional again, and test it.
Inform administrators to restore their CA updaters to point to the OSG cache again.
