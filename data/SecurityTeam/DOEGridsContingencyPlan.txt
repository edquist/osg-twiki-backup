Below is our plan should a DOEGrids CA outage continue for more than 4 days:

   * Find out all certs who scheduled to expire and has not been renewed. 
   * Contact those users with instructions.

---+ For personal certs

   * Send all CMS and Atlas users to CERN CA for personal certificates
   * For remaining users, send them to CILOgon CA if they can use Nebraska and UCSD sites.
   * For any other user, talk to NERSC CA whether if they issue personal certs. 
   * Contact VOMS admins with new cert DN so that users can be added into VOMS.

---+For service certs 
   * Ask NCSA to provide service certs. CERN, !FermiKCA and !CILogon are out of the question as they do not issue service certs.
   * If NCSA refuses to issue, ask ED's approval to buy individual certs from commercial CAs. Ask Digicert CA whether they can issue production CAs for our service certs. 
   * If requesting institution is a member for !InCommon and paid for service certificate service, then send them to use !InCommon service cert service. 
   * for worker does who does not use glexec, there is no need to request a service certificate. 
   * the new version of gums has a feature that does not require a worker node to have a service certificate. Put doumentation on how to turn on this feature. 

---++ Service Certificates Via NCSA
_Tentative, check with NCSA before requesting certs._ Issuance of host/service certificates by the NCSA CA for non-NCSA hosts is a manual exception process, so it won't scale well, but can be used in an emergency.

   * NCSA needs to know what is needed in the certificate (i.e., the fully-qualified hostname) and they will want an OSG security team member or OSG RA Agent to verify the request for them.

   * The process would be for the certificate requester to send a digitally signed email to ca-admin@ncsa.uiuc.edu, CCing the right OSG security/RA people, that says what certificate is needed.

   * the OSG security/RA person should follow-up to ca-admin with a digitally signed email saying it's OK for NCSA to issue the certificate. Then NCSA send the private key and certificate in an encrypted email to the requester.
