---+++ VOMS-Admin 2011-01-14
*Date*: 1/14/11<br>
*Software*: VOMS-Adminr<br>
*Summary*: Multiple cross site vulnerabilities were discovered that could allow authenticated users to get voms administrators to perform various voms admin functions unknowingly. This is a high risk for voms admin versions 2.5.x < 2.5.5, and a moderate risk for voms admins version 2.0.x. All sites should upgrade to avoid this problem. There has subsequently been other needs to upgrade voms-admin to at least 2.6.x as well, including sha2 compatibility.

<br>
*status*: Some sites are still running 2.0.x versions. They will need to upgrade before sha2 rollout.
