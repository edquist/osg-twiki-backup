---+ Incident Response Communication in OSG

The OSG Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) requires mechanisms to facilitate the appropriate handling of sensitive and private data related to computer security incidents.
Essential components of these mechanisms include authentication (to verify the identity of incident responders), access control (to ensure that sensitive and private incident data is accessible only to responders involved in an incident on a need-to-know basis), and encryption (to avoid eavesdropping on sensitive and private data at rest and as it moves across the network).
This page documents available mechanisms and proposes the adoption of new mechanisms and procedures.
This is a draft for discussion and does not represent official OSG policy.
