   * Follow up with Carl at Nebraska on HTCondor-CE drill. He was able to identify my test jobs, but did not send back actual log samples. Asked him about possibility of searching for username@submit host in classads on the CE. Waiting to hear back.
   * Asked Al to complete R&S application for Fermilab or send me the info to do it.
   * Check on Digicert's efforts to get their Robot profile approved by IGTF.
   * Make sure Incidents were up to date in the Wiki. Is it safe to just say "see ticket?" Inquired with GOC about how long old tickets will be
available.
   * Discussed service certs issue with Joe from Fermigrid. Can they get a single certificate to run production jobs if more than one person is logging into the production account to start them?

   * Opened ticket with another 4 VOs for checking AUP compliance. With this we have covered most VOs with significant usage reported on Gratia http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/. VOs fall into 4 categories (VOs contacted by tickets, direct emails, FNAL related VOs, and evaluated during traceability study) as documented at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/VOAUPSurvey.
