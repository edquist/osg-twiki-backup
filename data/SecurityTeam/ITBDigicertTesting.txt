---++Testing of new CA distribution format on ITB

As some of you have heard, we are transitioning to using Digicert CA for end user and host certificates. We are conducting a pilot trial where we test the Digicert certificates compatibility with our software. We only have a month to finish this test. 

This test will have three parts 1) get a new CA package with digicert test CA and test software components; 2) get digicert host and service certificates for the machines/services on ITB; and 3) get user certificates for ITB participants and test our s/w infrastructure with these new certificates. We hope to get a wide coverage of OSG s/w components tested in ITB just in the same way we tested the transition to the new CA format. We will be creating an RPM package which contains the new CA certificates which the ITB test site will install. 

---+++ Instruction to install DigiCert CA from OSG RPMs repositories
The new CA packages are released as RPMs to the osg-development and osg-testing repositories. 

// Add instructions here

---+++ Tests

Test expected from ITB is very simple. WE will provide you host and end user certificates from Digicert. You will install them on your ITB servers. You will do the  ITB tests as usual. Of course, we will also provide you with a CA files that contains the Digicert CA root certificate itself (see instructions). If GSI or some other library breaks, you will let us know. When you submit jobs or move data, we will also ask you to use your new Digicert personal certificate. To facilitate this
   1. Provide us with list of FQDNs for your ITB servers you need host and service certificate for.
   1. If you usually submit jobs to ITB servers for testing, then we will also get you a personal certificate from Digicert. 

In particular we want the following pieces of software/services tested/verified and signed off by ITB sites.

   1. CE 
      * gatekeeper
      * gsiftp
      * RSV probes
      * vdt-update-certs
      * vdt-ca-manage
      * fetch-crl
   2. SE (dcache/bestman)
   3. GUMS
   4. VOMS
   5. OSG client
      * globus client tools
      * srm client tools
      * Condor-G
   6. WN Client
   7. pilot jobs framework
   8. glexec
