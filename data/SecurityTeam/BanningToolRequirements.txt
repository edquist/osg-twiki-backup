---+ Banning Tool Requirements

Our high level requirements from a banning tool:

   1 pluggable into many authorization service
   1 easy to write policies
   1 coherent across a site
   1 GUMS is a VO policy enforcement while banning tool is a site policy enforcement
   1 propagation delay across a site is much more sensitive
   1 receives feedback from a grid-central location
   1 being able to ban entities, users, certs, proxies, FQAN, or VOs and easily restore access
   1 easier auditing: having explicit policy rules that shows the negative permissions
   1 high number of access requests per minute --(having simple policy)
