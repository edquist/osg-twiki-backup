---+ Banning Tool Requirements 
<pre> </pre><pre>Our high level requirements from a banning tool
1) pluggable into many authorization services
2) easy to write policies
2) coherent across a site
3) GUMS is a VO policy enforcement while banning tool is a site policy
enforcement
4) propagation delay across a site is much more sensitive
5) receives feedback from a grid-central location
6) being able to ban entities, users, certs, proxies, FQAN, or VOs and
easily restore access
7) easier auditing: having explicit policy rules that shows the negative
permissions
8) high number of access requests per minute --(having simple policy)
