   * Helped with the libuser security advisory
   * Helped with figuring out what to do with new Digicert intermediate SHA-2 key.  It needs a small amount of testing and an announcement with warnings to (a) upgrade web browser keys if desired and (b) make sure key bundles are up to date on grid servers.  If osg 3.1 is not yet end of life, it probably also needs to be updated.
   * Mine said she would update the KCA replacement architecture diagram/explanation to show shibboleth-authenticated web portal for getting cert from cilogon, myproxy, and ssh access to myproxy.
