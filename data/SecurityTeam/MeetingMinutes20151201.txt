   * Working with Jeff Gaynor yesterday on updates to FNAL cert DNs on test.cilogon.org.  He makes changes, contacts me by I.M., and I run tests. So far the changes he made cause the cert retrieval to fail.  He said that they're not internally propagating the 'ou' attribute.  
   * Roughly 20% done with first cigetcert implementation [[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/issues/10923][redmine]] ticket.  An existing python implementation of an ECP client is very helpful.  I'm trying to convert it to use the standard python 2.6 xml library rather than the extra lxml library the sample client used.
