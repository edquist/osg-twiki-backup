Meeting Notes 5/27/2014

*Kevin:*
   * We have a large number of gridftp servers running at each site. Gridftp servers are the biggest consumer of host certificates. Kevin will research if we can share a certificate across multiple servers securely. 
   * Europe has implemented a central banning service that pushes out the blacklisted users to sites automatically. We will most likely not write a new service for this. But, we are thinking about a way to push out the blacklist information without writing a new service. Kevin thinks we can setup a VOMS server specifically designed for the blacklisting purposes and configure GUMS to always check this VOMS server first. 
   *2FA. XSEDE has an ongoing project to implement 2FA. We will research whether this would be useful for our community or sys admins. 
   * Security controls for the year is starting soon. 
   * Oasis incident drill. waiting to hear form oasis team that they are ready for a drill

*Anand*
   * Conduct an evaluation of OSG-Connect project. Assess the security of the job submission process. Understand how we can contribute to the needs and problems in the identity management area. 
   * Evaluate the HCC VO and allow them to send certificate-free jobs.
