---++Meeting Notes


*Anand*

   * Feedback from RA Training: Emphasize that RA Agents approval does not automatically create a certificate. It is created when the end user clicks n generate certificate button. 
   * Making the IGTF release (10/09/2012). New bundle is prepared and sent to Tim on 10/02. Send an email to Dan, Tim, Marco, Mine that we finsihed the package and we are not doing anything beyond this. Except they specifically ask us to do something. 
   * Fully tested the SHA-2 CRLs in ITB for a week. No problems reported. ITB RPMs will go back to normal CRL (no-SHA-2), Pacman ITB will remain as SHA-2 CRLs. 
   * CA Layout change. No more progress. 
   * ST&E review. Got the document yesterday. Have not made progress yet. 
   * Beast attack.   An attack on confidentiality. An attacker can decrypt and obtain the proxy. Prevention is to put an empty package. Putting the empty fragment causes bestman to deadlock. Or upgrade to TLS 1.0. New jGlobus needs to turn off the empty fragment. Do research on srm authentication:in particular,  is the client proxy used for channel authentication; is the user proxy later sent as a delegated proxy, if so is it a limited proxy? 
   * https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/12741. We decided to update the twiki  https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SecurityTeam/WsGram and cofirm with Joe Bester with GRAM
   * Answer the email from Keith from Baylor university. 
   * GUMS sha-2 problems have been identified by Suchandra. Anand will attend the meeting with GUMS developers and software team.  

*Kevin*
   * Have not learned much about the new java vulnerability. This is not officially announced yet, but advertised via some unofficial hackers. This is discovered the same day we shipped out the java fix.
   * EGI people reported they will do the grading this week; delayed due to EGI technical meeting. kevin asked whether sites who did not see any jobs were due to the EGI submision failure or site mistakes. EGI did not report on this. Will ask again. 
   * Opened a JIRA ticket to add pakiti to software repo. Technical work completed. Starting the documentation. 
   * Condor vulnerability. Got permission to run under MIS VO. 
   * Still seeing gratia vulnerability updates. SecurityTeam team was not notified on the tickets. Find out who sent those and what process was followed. 

*Mine*
   * German Grid CA issued a SHA2 certs for GGUS service. https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/12749#1349079366
