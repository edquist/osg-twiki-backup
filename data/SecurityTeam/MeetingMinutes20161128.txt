   * I cancelled my request to  Scientific Linux regarding making the new kx509 rpm automatically replace the old one, because it isn't our responsibility.  I am concerned though that the project manager doesn't seem to think it his responsiblity either.
   *  Brian B presented a [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/586323/contributions/2380086/attachments/1376595/2090564/Singularity-isolation.pdf][singularity status update]] to the WLCG Isolation/Traceability group.  For the first time I saw him say that home directories are not bind-mounted into the container with the -C option, but he was wrong about that.  So he now realizes that he'll need the -H patch that I made, which won't be available until singularity-2.3, and he'll need an update to HTCondor to use it.   He's not worried about using singularity on RHEL6, he'll just push it for RHEL7 use cases.  He expects that the kernel feature we need for running non-setuid root won't be available until RHEL8, which is expected to be released in a couple of years.
   * Brian B proposed using Let's Encrypt X.509 Certificates for OSG CEs, which sounds promising.
   * I helped Jeny with figuring out that the Fermilab ECP IdP should disable RC4, MD5, and IDEA ciphers.
