---++Meeting Minutes 05/04/2010 

*Igor*
   * NeBioGrid audit. Users do not use the portal for job submission, but ssh into the submit node. Each user has their own account and they can run whichever executable they like to run. 
   * The matchmaker and the gatekeeper are on the same node only because Ian likes to save as much hardware as possible. the web server on the submit node just serves static web pages.  

   * We earlier asked to audit Panda, but Mine is no longer sure. we asked Ruth  if we should do the panda review
 
*Anand*
   * Release date unknown for pakiti
   * the implementation of sponsors integrated web page is more than halfway done. Should we just ask RA agents for a list of sponsors or do we have a list of the sponsors? Doug can generate the sponsor's name from the database. 
   * Anand is on vulnerability duty
   * Java v6 issue. do we have any existing java 5 vulnerability that is not patched? the vulnerabilities are listed at http://www.oracle.com/technology/deploy/security/critical-patch-updates/javacpumar2010.html and there is one outstanding security vulnerability against java 5. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0840
   * Currently patches are only released for solaris and even if we want to pay for it, we cannot get the patches because we distribute code openly. brian B had run the osg services with java 6 and said there was no problem. 

   * JGridStart tool works with myproxy, but it is not useful. It requires the user to export/import the certificate to upload into the Myproxy server. this is additional complexity.  

   * Doug thinks importing is much easier than exporting. on mac, just double click on the certificate and it imports. 
   * We can switch to command line clients. the client can create the p12 file.  
   * *Action Item* Mine will test how hard it is to import p12 files on Windows. 
   * We should customize the command line script for osg. command line does not have revocation. except that , all other features of the web system exists in the command line. we can implement gui for the command line: very similar to what existing. step by step drop down menus. 

   * People do not know about the command line script. 
   * why would not SBgrid use command line tools. the problem was they did not assign ssh access to their users until the users get a certificate. But once a user is authorized to join SBgrid, they can right away set up ssh access and then the user can request certificate from that node with the command line. 
 
*Doug* 
   * Testing ITB CA distribution. checking with John Weigand. GOC has installed an ITB software cache. Doug made a CA distribution according to the new layout. the new package is installed at the ITB cache. Changes are made to vdt-ca-manage to specif the itb location. 
   * we will talk to ITB folks on Th. cert-check-time and cert-check-crl and RSV probes may complain with the new layout. cert-check-time, for example, will complain for CAs without CRLs. 
   * How test cycle works in ITB: Panda instance robot sends jobs to the persisten itb sites: FNAL_FERMIGRID_ITB  	 BNL_ITB_Test1 UC_ITB 	LBNL_DSD_ITB 	CIT_ITB_1 	LIGO_CIT 

   * RSV probes are probably tested on ITB nodes. Anad thinks RSV definitely will be effected. 
   * *Action Item* Doug needs to look at the code and identify which other programs might get affected. We should have a list of services being tested in ITB and then think through if there are any missing services that should be tested. If all crticial services are already checked in ITB, we do not need to do any manual checks. VOMS is not in ITB and it will surely be tested. Weigand has a VOMS installation, he can test for us.  
   * CMS openID case: 
   * why would not they prefer to use VOMS server? if you have an apache mod_voms module, then it would work. Igor says there is one. Why would then cms and SBgrid is against using voms for web authentication and authorization. Igor thinks voms-proxy would not work with browser. voms and gums are not designed to do web authentication. Mine thinks there is no need for proxies If a user does regular ssl handshake and sends the DN, the apache server could be able to check the DN against the VOMS server. But Doug thinks this is extra work. 
   * Dhiva will put together a VM and install the new Registration Manager but it is not the highest priority
   * GOC is running the ESNet database monitoring script. Replicating the database would be the next step. the replica database is still at LBNL. 
   * Do we need any UI? should there be any reporting interface. Mine thinks it would be great if we can make reporting available to VOs and end users. Doug thinks this does not give any additional information to users. Users already have an interface through which they can see their requests status. Mine asks what if the user gets assigned a new sponsor, which happens in most problematic cases where user does not know which sponsor to pick for.  Doug says if the agent picks a different sponsor. this is not updated in the db. this is only archived in the osg-ra-logs email archives. The db only records the initial request and the sponsor picked by the user. 

   * *Action Item* Check whether new Registration Manager will allow agents to update information about a request in the database
   * No new problematic agents. Education VO users request multiple certs. when they get a single cert approved, the other requests just hang. who is pruning these requests? Doug usually deletes them. after 30 days a request can be canceled without cause. 
   * Are the agents complying with new practices? Doug thinks there is not an easy way to check this. We can individually check with the RA agent.
