   * VOMS AUP signing?
   * A machine at Xsede/TACC was compromised. Was caught same day. Users logged in at the time were identified. One OSG user, he didn't have any certificates on the system.
   * Tim C. asked if its ok to close https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-983. Closed, will open new ticket if issues come up.
   * New CA bundles in testing.
   * Updating the CA package to the new layout. Opened GOC tickets for DOSAR and DayaBay to see if/when they will update voms-admin. Horst is investigating for DOSAR, DayaBay will be shutting down their voms server.
   * When Perfsonar releases the patch, we will send an update to our sites. 
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...

   * Followed up with Glow VO on allowing jobs without end user certificate to FNAL. 
      * Had meeting with Nate and team at CHTC, 
      * CHTC has set up a new glidein frontend that is accepting jobs only from trusted submit nodes.
      * Received log files (glidein job's stdout and stderr) from factory of jobs that originated from the new frontend. The .err logs has the startd and started logs encoded which can be decoded using glideinwms/factory/tools/cat_StartdLog.py and glideinwms/factory/tools/cat_StarterLog.py respectively/
      * CHTC team will look into these logs to see if they can trace it back to a particular user on a submit node.
