   * Still working on rebuilding ca cert bundles. Didn't hear back from Tim about whether or not we should release new new-format packages as well. Need to double check dependencies.
   * New VO training with CTA scheduled for Thursday 9am.
   * NTP DDOS Advisory sent. 
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Will evaluate security of perfSonar test box at GOC and the perfSonar dashboard. Still need to set up test vms.
   * Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0 after New Year.
