---++ Project Plan for Streamlining CA Release Process
---+++ Problem Statement
The OSG CA certificates are released to RPM format to both GOC (old OSG RPM repository) and the new OSG S/W repository. Since the RPM release to GOC predated the OSG RPM effort (and our use of Koji), the old RPMs that are created do not follow the standards we use on Koji. Furthermore supporting multiple production RPMs will cause the release process to be error prone and cause confusion to user.

---+++ Goal
   * Merge two separate RPM releases to GOC and Koji and streamline the process of preparing the release 

---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand, Mine (Lead)
   * GOC: Rob Q, Scott T
   * VDT: Alain

---+++ Deliverables from the project:
   * Updated process of creating a CA distribution.
      * Changes will be documented at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CreatingCADistributions]].
   * Updates to the scripts/ RPM spec files used in the CA creation process as needed.
   * Prepare instruction for sites to do the transition.

---+++ Schedule
   * Effort: 2 FTE week, no extra effort needed
   * Project start : January 15, 2012
   * Project End Date: May 31, 2012
      * Development Phase ends: Feb 28, 2012
      * Deprecation of GOC service: May 31, 2012
   
---+++Project implementation Plan (Steps for deprecating CA certs RPMs from GOC's Yum repository)
   * Get a list of sites that are using the repositories at GOC. (GOC - Completed.  Scott send us the list)
   * Contact the sites using the repository to get their input. (Anand - Emails sent to sites) Expected Completion: 2/10
      * One of the big concern we had was problems caused by the new style format. So we have contacted sites known to use the RPMs from GOC based on logs GOC provided.
      * None of the sites contacted are known to be using it for VOMS or have expressed any other concern with deprecation
   * Transition plan for deprecating the GOC RPM repository, (Anand - Underway, Rob, Mine and Alain will be consulted and sign off)  Expected Completion: 2/10
      * We will keep the packages at GOC unchanged 
         * We except to continue making regular production releases till the repository is deprecated (May 31).
      * Update the CA release process documentation on twiki  (Anand) Expected Completion: 2/28
      * Update CA release scripts, RPM spec files as needed (Anand) Expected Completion: 2/28
      * Update instructions on software.grid.iu.edu (GOC)
   * Send out a broad announcement OSG community/mailing list to indicate this change is happening.(Anand, Mine) Expected Completion: 2/20 
      *  In case the logs at GOC  missed some user we can reach them.
   * Develop instruction for sites to move to new OSG Yum SW repository. (Anand, Alain, Scott) Expected Completion: 2/28
   * Deprecation of old GOC Yum repository (5/31)

---+++ Dependencies/ Risks
   * Need to work with GOC to push the transition plan to production. Some effort on GOC side needed to implement the changes to the RPM repositories.
   * If a significant stakeholder using GOC repository objects to the transition the process may be delayed

---+++ Affected Parties
   * This change will affect anyone (primarily OSG resource admins) using RPM (Yum) packages from repositories at GOC.
