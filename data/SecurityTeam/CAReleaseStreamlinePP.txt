---++ Project Plan for Streamlining CA Release Process
---+++ Problem Statement
The OSG CA certificates are released to RPM format to both GOC (old OSG RPM repository) and the new OSG repository. Since the RPM release to GOC predated the OSG RPM effort (and our use of Koji), the old RPMs that are created do not follow the standards we use on Koji. Furthermore supporting multiple production RPMs will cause the release process to be error prone. Additionally GOC currently maintains a APT repository for out Debian releases (used primarily by LIGO), we will investigate if these can be moved over to a common repository VDT maintains 

---+++ Goal
   * Merge two separate releases to GOC and Koji and streamline the process of preparing the release 
   * Improve release process for Debian releases
