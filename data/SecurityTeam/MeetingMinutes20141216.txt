   * Working with Garhan to complete some more tests for Condor-CE security drill. We will try looking up a particular job on a worker node this week.
   * Couldn't get the digicert admin interface to issue a personal cert with sha-1 manually. Opened a ticket and Darin from Digicert was cc'ed. Haven't heard a reply. Do we have another technical contact at Digicert?
   * Updated OSG risk assessment matrix. Should updated document be saved to docdb as new version of old doc or as a new doc by itself?
