Meeting Minutes: 

   *Jim* 
   * Contacted the guy who investigated the noc incident. Leif said Bitcoin wallet was hosted in sweden. Most likely they found the wallet in Sweden via another compromised site at Taiwan who was reporting to the wallet. By tracing machines who are reporting to the wallet, we discovered the other compromises. 

   * We strongly think this is the same guy who attacked the Canadian site. Same attacking IP address is used. Attacker exploits various attack vectors; used ssh credentials. used tpmcat and jboss vulnerability. We do not think he uses distributed job submission techniques such as condor. He seems to exploit one host at a time and run jobs. 
   * cpu utilization is not a strong indication of the compromise. The attacker can adjust it. We will send a list of easy-to-diagnose symptoms. Best things to do is to watch interactive node access, check logs for ip address, 
   * We will present to ET this Th. I will talk about the amount of time spent on operational security. Jim will include extra items he spent time on in the document he prepared.
