---+ Summary of 2012 Vulnerabilities

---++ Open

*Date*: 12/3/12<br>
*Software*: !MySQL<br>
*Summary*: Various !MySQL zero-day vulnerabilities announced.

Looks like all require a local user, not sure yet if that includes sql injection via web apps logged into mysql servers.

*Links*:
   * CVE-2012-5611 duplicate of CVE 2012-5579 MySQL (Linux) Stack based buffer overrun PoC Zeroday
MariaDB versions 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.5, in which CVE 2012-5579 is fixed, are available for download. MySQL provider Oracle has yet to confirm the vulnerabilities, or provide updated software.

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/4
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882599
Exploit Factors:
The attacker must have a mysql user (any account (anonymous account?), post auth). This will yield a shell as the user 'mysql' when properly exploited. Considered High severity.

   * CVE-2012-5612 MySQL (Linux) Heap Based Overrun PoC Zero day
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/5
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882600
Exploit Factors:
The attacker must have a mysql user account. Used to run additional code once exploited. Considered High severity.

   * CVE-2012-5613 MySQL (Linux) Database Privilege Elevation Improper Configuration issue, please ensure proper controls for accounts. Such as limiting file operations using --secure-file-priv server option.
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/6
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882606
Exploit Factors:
The attacker must have a mysql user with 'file' privileges for the target and will use the user privileges to create additional administrative accounts. Considered Medium severity. Exploit here:
http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/118552/mysql_privilege_elevation.pl.txt
   >> * CVE-2012-5614 MySQL Denial of Service Zero day PoC
>> http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/7
>> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882607
>> Exploit Factors:
>> An authenticated database user could use this flaw to cause a temporary denial of service.  Considered low severity.
>> http://packetstormsecurity.org/files/118550/mysql_bufferoverrun.pl.txt
   * CVE-2012-5615 MySQL Remote Preauth User Enumeration Zero day
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Dec/9
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882608
Exploit Factors:
If an attacker authenticates using an incorrect password with the old authentication mechanism from mysql 4.x and below to a mysql 5.x server the mysql server will respond with a different message than Access Denied, what makes User Account Enumeration possible. Considered Low severity - however can be used to identify users for above exploits requiring a user.

*Summary*: Updates coming for EL. Need to evaluate need for vdt 1.2 update.
---------

*Date*: 11/12/12<br>
*Software*: Tomcat<br>
*Summary*: versions 6.0.35 and earlier and versions 7.0.27 and earlier are vulnerable to a DOS attack via malformed http headers. Also, all these versions as well as 5.5.35 and earlier are vulnerable to an authentication bypass attack when using the DIGEST authentication method.

   * http://tomcat.apache.org/security-6.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_6.0.36
   * http://tomcat.apache.org/security-5.html#Fixed_in_Apache_Tomcat_5.5.36

*Status*: Red Hat as well as SL have not yet released new packages. Not directly a worry for OSG since no one uses username/passwords with our web apps.

----

*Date*: 10/22/12<br>
*Software*: Bestman (Beast Attack on SSL)<br>
*Summary*:  A risk assessment of the beast attack on bestman is being conducted, because Brian brought to our attention the need for bestman client to disable the precautions against the BEAST attack  due to a nasty deadlock issue between different versions of bestman clients. 

Here is some background information about the BEAST attack: This is attack against SSL/TLS that allows an adversary to efficiently decrypt and obtain authentication tokens and cookies from HTTPS requests. The two common methods of attacked involved the use of WebSockets and Java Applets. When announced several major browsers and/or extensions were vulnerable. OpenSSL's "empty fragment" feature, which inserts a single empty TLS record has been suggested as a workaround to mitigate against such attacks.

The CVE associated with this is at http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3389 and Redhat has classified it as moderate impact https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3389

*Investigation*  Bestman2 client uses jglobus2, which in turn uses Java's built-in SSL implementation.  This implementation uses the empty fragment trick similarly to OpenSSL, and triggers the bug that
caused deadloack and effectively triggers a DOS attack.  So, to make jglobus2 usable, bestman has to turn off the sending of the empty fragment. 

The client proxy is used by BeStMan for authentication and authorization (by verifying with either GUMS or a gridmap) for file access. The client connection to bestman is based on old httpg for channel authentication.

Most of OSG usage  is with the higher level of management tools, such as FTS or phedex, and they don't use fully delegated proxy.  Some user analysis thru Condor uses limited proxy. Fully delegated proxy, is used where dCache is doing data replication on behalf of the client. bestman on OSG does not do this operation with the Gateway mode. Some advanced users use lcg-cp/ls commands, and these probably use full proxy (by using voms-proxy-init to create their proxy without any options). However the number of such users is very few. Hence, most of OSG usage of bestman is with the limited proxy. Also OSG usage does not include any 3rd party copy process with bestman. 

Furthermore for the Beast attack to occur needs an additional channel so it can control the CBC IV. The typical vector of such attack is through iframe injection or loading javascript in browser, though other channels may be used. 

There is however a small additional risk allowing bestman to operate without patching against the Beast attack poses. Though beast attack on bestman data integrity of the particular connection could be lost and proxy and other information could be stolen. if data integrity cannot be guaranteed but GSI handshaking and GUMS mapping are somehow still valid, there is nothing bestman can do to prevent data compromise. if the proxy is compromised, it's not only the problem of bestman and it affects everything in OSG and beyond.

*Status*: Given the investigation, and considering the deadlock problem bug that gets introduced on patching against the beast attack, we believe it is OK to leave it temporarily unpatched while the bug gets resolved.  We do not believe that beast attack posses a substantial risk for bestman, but it does increase bestman's risk profile somewhat.

*Date*: 10/16/12<br>
*Software*: !MySQL<br>
*Summary*: Various non-specific denial of service and privilege escalation for authenticated users.<br>
*Status*: Still investigating if anything here warrants a new pacman mysql release. I believe we've let other dos/authenticated user issues go before.

    Summary of problem: local DOS, possibly arbitrary code execution<br>

       http://secunia.com/advisories/47891/<br>
       http://research.cs.wisc.edu/condor/security/vulnerabilities/CONDOR-2012-0001.html<br>
       https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=759548<br>
    Status:<br>
        Don't believe that condor running on at least Red Hat<br>
        derived systems is vulnerable to the arbitrary code<br>
        execution problem.<br>
      OSG 1.2:<br>
         A local denial-of-service is already<br>
        straightforward.<br>
             Looking to phase out OSG 1.2 support for non-Red Hat<br>
       platforms. The version numbers listed are no longer supported<br>
       by the OS vendors except for AIX 5.3.<br>
           http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/2.0.0/requirements.html<br>
     OSG 4.0:<br>
        The current Release 3.0 version (condor-7.6.6-1.osg.x86_64.rpm)<br>
        is not vulnerable to even the local DOS problem.<br>
