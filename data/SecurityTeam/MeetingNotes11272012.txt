---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * Condor vulnerability. Will run the scanner this afternoon one more time. 
   * Will open tickets for the vulnerable resources. 
   * Pakiti. There was a request to make the client service also have the stop and start package. The package will allow stopping and starting the client. 
      * once they move this to test repo, Kevin will ask people to test and give feedback. 12/15 deployment to production is our estimate. 
   * CILogon contacts gridunesp and uflorida. no progress yet. 
   * Jira ticket 38. will work on it this week. 
   * CILogon CA is released to the ITB. GOC asked us to test their itb versions. We should find out when is this making into the production. Kevin will test all goc services from the GOC. 


*Anand*  
   * Anand only released the SHA-2 certs to the development cache.  He will remove the SHA-2 certs from dev repo. Anand will create a current IGTF pre-release to ITB on Dec 4th. Most likely this will be on production Dec 18. 
   * We should notify the IGTF about root CAs must not move to the SHA-2 because it will break the incompatibility between old and new versions of client and servers. 
   * GlideinWMS Drill. MIS VO does not have a Front End. Asked Marco for access to OSG FrontEnd. HCC, Glow, Engage have FrontEnds. Each FrontEnd is maintained by their own VO. But most of them use the factory at UCSD. 
      * How many FrontEnds we have in total? How are they connected to one another? Who runs and maintains the FrontEnds? How many factories does OSG have? Does all the VOs use the same factory?
      * How does a user gain access to FrontEnds? 
   * No progress with GUMS simplification project.
