---+ 2010 VO SecurityTeamTeamTeamTeamTeam Challenge Plan

We want to start preparing for a new security drill.  Our aim is to pretend a site is compromised and observe how quickly we drop the site from OSG infrastructure and how quickly VOs stop sending jobs to a compromised site.  This is also going to relate to which information provider the VOs are using to send their jobs.

| VO | Information Provider |
| ALICE | |
| ATLAS | |
| CDF | Uses  legacy custom/hybrid mechanism. |
| CIGI | |
| CMS | BDII |
| CompBioGrid | |
| DES | |
| DOSAR | |
| DZero | Custom system based  on  SAM,  which itself is based on CORBA. Site catalogs are static. |
| Engage | |
| Fermi-VO | Uses  a  new  custom  mechanism,  based on automatically derived  site  listing  from  OIM.  Site  catalog  may be dynamic. |
| Geant4 | Completed its WMS integration with MatchMaker. |
| GLOW | |
| Gluex | |
| GPN | |
| GRASE | |
| GridUNESP | |
| GROW | |
| i2u2 | |
| IceCube | |
| ILC | |
| JDEM | |
| LIGO | |
| mariachi | |
| MIS | |
| nanoHUB | Uses  its custom mechanism, based on periodically derived site listing from OIM. Site catalog is static. |
| NWICG | |
| NYSGrid | Custom/hybrid mechanism. It may be based on OIM and somewhat dynamic, but we will have to confirm. |
| SBGrid | Currently integrating MatchMaker/ReSS. |
| STAR | |

Issues to address:<BR>
How are we going to run the challenge w/o affecting other jobs that may be in the queue to submit?<BR>
We will likely have to notify sites that we are removing as well as the VO when running the drill.<BR>
What is the goal of the drill?<BR>
What kind of timeline will the drill take to affect the sites the least amount?<BR>
