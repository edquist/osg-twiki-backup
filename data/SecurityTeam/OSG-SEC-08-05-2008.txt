---+ OSG-SEC-08-05-2008

There is a widespread incident involving non-OSG grid sites where attackers gained access using stolen ssh keys and local kernel exploits to gain root access. Rootkits were installed and ssh keys have been systematically stolen and used to compromise further sites. Some sites report only account compromised (no root escalation) and some other have simply detected unsuccessful ssh scans.

No OSG site has been reported to be infected or compromised, but we request continued vigilance to guard against this attack affecting OSG systems.

All sites should check their status and actively search for:
   * Connections attempts from the suspicious IP addresses 
   * Traces of suspicious SSH keys, files and malware described below

Sites should also ensure that their system software is up-to-date (i.e., security updates have been applied) and that they are running an up-to-date Linux kernel.

US-CERT Current Activity

SSH Key-based Attacks

Original release date: August 26, 2008 at 3:41 pm
Last revised: August 26, 2008 at 3:41 pm


US-CERT is aware of active attacks against linux-based computing
infrastructures using compromised SSH keys. The attack appears to
initially use stolen SSH keys to gain access to a system, and then
uses local kernel exploits to gain root access. Once root access has
been obtained, a rootkit known as "phalanx2" is installed.

Phalanx2 appears to be a derivative of an older rootkit named
"phalanx". Phalanx2 and the support scripts within the rootkit, are
configured to systematically steal SSH keys from the compromised
system. These SSH keys are sent to the attackers, who then use them to
try to compromise other sites and other systems of interest at the
attacked site.

Detection of phalanx2 as used in this attack may be performed as
follows:
  * "ls" does not show a directory "/etc/khubd.p2/", but it can be
    entered with "cd /etc/khubd.p2".
  * "/dev/shm/" may contain files from the attack.
  * Any directory named "khubd.p2" is hidden from "ls", but may be
    entered by using "cd".
  * Changes in the configuration of the rootkit might change the
    attack indicators listed above. Other detection methods may
    include searching for hidden processes and checking the reference
    count in "/etc" against the number of directories shown by "ls".

US-CERT encourages administrators to perform the following actions to
help mitigate the risks:
  * Proactively identify and examine systems where SSH keys are used
    as part of automated processes. These keys will typically not have
    passphrases or passwords.
  * Encourage users to use the keys with passphrase or passwords to
    reduce the risk if a key is compromised.
  * Review access paths to internet facing systems and ensure that
    systems are fully patched.

If a compromise is confirmed, US-CERT recommends the following
actions:
  * Disable key-based SSH authentication on the affected systems,
    where possible.
  * Perform an audit of all SSH keys on the affected systems.
  * Notify all key owners of the potential compromise of their keys.

US-CERT will provide additional information as it becomes available.

---++ Attack Vector
 The attackers have been stealing SSH keys to compromise more accounts and machines. If the attacker got root access all keys which are not protected by a password or by other special measures should be regarded as compromised.

The keys might easily be used to attack further hosts and should be disabled at your site and everywhere else, too.

Please send any malicious SSH keys or their fingerprints (ssh-keygen -l -f <keyfile>) that you may have discovered to both [[mailto:project-egee-osct@cern.ch][project-egee-osct@cern.ch]] and [[mailto:cert@dfn-cert.de][cert@dfn-cert.de]].

It appears the same rootkit has been used at different sites: http://packetstormsecurity.nl/UNIX/penetration/rootkits/phalanx-b6.tar.bz2

Different versions of this rootkit have been discovered. It uses /dev/mem to manipulate the kernel and modify the hooks for some system calls. /dev/shm is used for staging, storing some of the file. The same directory is used by the python script.

If the rootkit was used with the same configuration on your host, you will find:
   * The directory '/etc/khubd.p2/' is not listed by 'ls /etc' but can be entered with 'cd /etc/khubd.p2/'. Alternatively, the directory '/etc/lolzz.p2' has been used in one incident 
   * In '/dev/shm/' there might be files of the attackers 
   * If you create a directory named 'khubd.p2' it will also not be shown by 'ls' but you can enter it 

The DFN-CERT tested the rootkit concerning the backdoor. A simple nmap scanning does not reveal anything. An infected system does also not start communication of its own - at least not with the version tested. There were quite special communication patterns seen regarding the U Calgary IP address which might be the information needed to start the backdoor. This might be similar to the mechanism of the suckit rootkit.

Artifacts found on the compromised hosts:

   * .p2rc some sort of config file setting aliases for copying stuff by ssh and with ssh-keys provided 
   * .phalanx2 loader of the rootkit and probably backdoor 
   * .sniff sniffer log 
   * sshgrab.py python script for collecting ~/.ssh dirs and shell histories of all users if readable 

It's been reported that the following root exploit has been found on one of the compromised hosts:
   * http://secwatch.org/exploits/2006/07/raptor_prctl.c which lists 
   * Vulnerable platforms: Linux from 2.6.13 up to 2.6.17.4 

and references http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2006-2451 but we don't know if this is the only local kernel exploit involved.

Mingchao (EGEE) compiled below the kernel versions of the hosts that have been root compromised:

   * Kernel: 2.6.22.7-57.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.22.1-32.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.22.14-72.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.22.9-61.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.20-1.2962.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.22.9-61.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.22.9-61.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.22.14-72.fc6 
   * Kernel: 2.6.9-67.0.15 (SL4) 
   * Kernel: 2.6.9-67.0.20 (SL4) 
   * Fedora-Core-4/2.6.17-1.2142_FC4 
   * Fedora-Core-3/2.6.12-2.3.legacy_FC3smp 
   * Suse 10.0 kernel 2.6.13-15-default 

Most of the discovered root exploits affect old/unpatched kernels, for instance: http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/2006 (Vixie cron exploit)

---+++ Common attack patterns

Leif Nixon (NSC) kindly provided below a list of a similarities in the attack patterns that were reported. This may help sites discover compromised accounts.
   * disabling command line history logging with export HISTFILE=/dev/null or unset HISTFILE, 
   * starting out intrusions with a set of brief noninteractive logins across multiple candidate systems that scout out the systems, typically running "id", "w", "uname -a", "mount" and similar, before choosing a target host and trying to root it, 
   * trying to use nfsshell to get elevated write privileges over NFS, 
   * logging in using "ssh <host> /bin/sh -i" or "ssh <host> /bin/bash -i", rather than just "ssh <host>". 

---++ Status

   * *Status*: _CLOSED_ 
   * *Lead*: Jim Basney (+1 217 244 1954 / +1 217 778 4398 / jbasney@ncsa.uiuc.edu) 
   * *Responders*: Mine, Jim, Doug

_Optionally include additional status information here._

---++ Analysis

   * *Severity*: High: hacker activity is ongoing with risk of compromise 
   * *Urgency*: High: please give this incident a high priority during business hours. Reactions within one business day are expected. 

---++ Mitigation Plan

---+++ Actions to take

1) Our first action is to contact USAtlas and Atlas security officers and obtain a report (see above email from Dantong Yu)

2) Receive confirmation from EGEE to re-distribute the announcement (has already obtained as of 08-05 17:00 )

3) receive ET approval over OSG announcement (obtained 08-05-2008 around 6 pm)

4) send announcement to OSG sites and ask them to watch malicious IP addresses and the above user certificate. Sites should be able to automatically update their GUMS server

they should report any suspicious activity in this user's account and from above IP addresses.

two announcements sent out on 08-06-2008

5) We can possibly check whether sites have updated from Atlas VOMS server. This is optional and not necessary.

New actions based on new information received 08-19-2008:

6) Inform OSG sites about ongoing activity and coordinate with other incident response organizations.

---+++ How to monitor progress

We can use Gratia checks to see whether any jobs have been submitted with Karl Harrison's certificate.

We can also check if all sites have updated their GUMS server. We can send a notification. This is optional.

Coordinate with DFN-CERT, EGEE OSCT, and others.

---+++ Acceptable response time estimate

Response is expected within one business day.

---+++ List of affected parties

All OSG sites who accepted Atlas users are affected by two user accounts compromised. We believe that previous incidents at U Chicago and German Grid did not affect the OSG. We are informed that no user certificates have been compromised in both incidents.

---+++ Definition of End Of Event

Close of event will occur when, based on information from OSG sites and other CERTs, we determine that the high risk has passed.

---++ Incident Log
---+++ Communication with Atlas 08-05-2008

We contacted USAtlas and Atlas security officers and received the following report from Dantong Yu:

Please make announcement to the OSG site. I checked various system in BNL, and did not discover any suspicious activities from this particular user. I asked Jay to suspend this user from the ATLAS VOMS server. Alessandro agreed to remove this user from Atlas VOMS.

Here is what we found: <br /> <br /> 1) This user has a local account, but he has no activities in past few years. His logon shell is /bin/tcshnologin. Our system admin is pretty sure that BNL is not affected by this user. <br /> <br /> 2) We checked that our OSG gatekeeper logs. We did not see any job submitted by this user. <br /> <br /> 3) GUMS shows that this user was mapped to usatlas4 account. <br /> <br /> 4) The ATLAS analysis framework shows that this user submitted a job on 2006-04-12 10:15:58. We removed this user from ATLAS database to prevent him from submitting jobs.

---+++ The Sites Affected so far(including non-OSG sites)

The D-Grid, U Chicago and CERN incident have been reported on 08-05-2008. The remaining sites are reported on 08-06-2008.

1) First attack has affected the German Grid and been reported to EGEE. German Grid has some sites registered in EGEE and it is a national grid. The earliest report dates back to 8/4/2008 by an email from EGEE. NONE of these sites are registered with OSG.

The attacks on the German hosts seem to have come from:<br /><br />- - 208.42.23.94 - 2008-07-28 01:52:53 GMT+02<br />- - 216.186.49.132 - 2008-07-26 17:02:12 GMT+02<br />- - 75.60.89.233 - 2008-07-26 23:16:40 GMT+02<br /><br />We assume that the stolen ssh keys were transfered to:<br /><br />- - 136.159.55.31 - 2008-07-28 02:16:14 GMT+02<br /><br />RAL observed additional suspicious connection attempts from:<br /><br />- - 189.6.137.174 - 2008-07-14 10:37:44 GMT+02<br />- - 190.81.35.90 - 2008-07-14 14:08:59 GMT+02

FZ Juelich - Breakin 2008-07-28 00:34:13 GMT+02 from 216.186.49.132

Universitaet Wuppertal - Breakin 2008-07-26 17:02:12 GMT+02 via account "petrov"

Jul 26 17:02:12 jpsi sshd[9535]: Accepted publickey for petrov from 216.186.49.132 port 3664 ssh2

Break in via frontend of a small cluster of the theortical physics department. There is no grid middleware. ssh keys were stolen and from there workstations were compromised and more ssh keys stolen. The cluster in Wuppertal was not part of D-Grid.

DESY - Attempts maybe from 131.142.42.17 (2008-07-25 15:08:31 GMT+02) and 216.186.49.132 (2008-07-25 20:07:00 GMT+02) - it's not yet clear if this was legitimate (but we doubt it). No breakin.

The IP addresses include:
   * 134.94.104.3 
   * 134.94.74.11 
   * 134.94.74.111 
   * 134.94.169.134

   * 132.195.105.56 
   * 132.195.105.204 

2) Another very similar attack has been detected at U of Chicago and has been posted at http://hep.uchicago.edu/admin/report_072808.html

U Chicago confirmed that NO OSG resources at U of Chicago have been affected and therefore there is no OSG incident. <br />Attack probably from bonner-pcs2.rice.edu - 168.7.16.22<br /><br />Hosts involved:

<br />4) rice.edu - no information received. Rice is NOT an OSG site

5) CERN confirmed short but successful SSH connections from one of the malicious IP addresses below and is currently actively investigating the affected hosts. (NOT OSG)<br /><br />Jul 25 19:45:40 lxplus011 sshd[14080]: Accepted publickey for karl from<br />216.186.49.132 port 3399 ssh2<br />Jul 25 19:46:09 lxplus239 sshd[19137]: Accepted publickey for karl from<br />216.186.49.132 port 4322 ssh2<br /><br />Karl Harrison's account is believed to be compromised and has been blocked at CERN. Karl submitted a small number of<br />grid jobs, which are currently being investigated.<br /><br />More successful SSH connections have been detected between Jul 25<br />19:37:19 UTC+2 and Jul 25 20:11:09 UTC+2, involving 3 more users, but<br />none of them are grid users.<br /><br />While forensics are still ongoing, there is so far no evidence that the<br />attacker managed to obtain root access at CERN.

EGEE/CERN Security officer has not confirmed whether this user's X509 certificate is also compromised.

See affected users section below for more information

6) Cambridge pcet.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk - Breakin 2008-07-14 18:56 UTC+1:<br /> The same rootkit has been found at the host<br /> cet.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk (131.111.66.23), which belongs to one of<br /> UK GridPP sites. It appears to have been installed on *14 July<br /> 2008 at 18:56*. From the datestamp on the sshgrab.py file and<br /> Cambridge CERT reports on traffic to 136.159.55.31 it appears<br /> that the ssh keys were collected up to 25 July. The site<br /> involved is actively investigating into it. NOT OSG<br /><br />7) UK RAL Tier1 has detected a successful ssh login from the malicious IP<br />(216.186.49.132).

However, this does not seem to affect OSG site. We asked for confirmation. Below is JimBarlow's initial report.

The uiuc.edu cluster below is actually hosts on NCSA's network. We discovered<br />the compromised accounts on 7/26 and pretty much cleaned up from the<br />incident. A report was sent to the TG incident-report email address and<br />discussed on TG security-wg incident calls. When the DFN-CERT sent out<br />information to the FIRST mailing list I responded to them with our information,<br />which is how it came to be included in the information below. I am working<br />with DFN-CERT on this a bit more to see what comes forth. If anyone wants<br />to know more info, then let me know.

<br />15) Harvard - No contact yet. 131.142.42.17 might be involved. Breakin or attempts from 216.186.49.132 2007-07-25 and 131.142.42.17<br />Harvard has several resources registered with OSG. We sent an email and asked site admin for confirmation (Ian Syokes-Rees).

16) University of Minnesota - Attempts from 216.186.49.132 at 2008-07-25<br />17:28:30 GMT to 22:37:35 GMT. Does not look like they gained access. Not an OSG member

---+++ User Affected So Far

There are two users known to be affected so far.

1) Karl Harrison's account at CERN has been compromised (reported and suspended by Atlas on 08-05-2008). EGEE/CERN Security officer has not confirmed whether this user's X509 certificate is also compromised. In OSG, this user has the following access rights:

"/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Cambridge/L=UCS/CN=karl harrison002" "/atlas" usatlas4

Atlas and USAtlas Security Officers have confirmed that the last activity submitted by this user is dated 2006-04-12 10:15:58. They think that there should not be any active jobs submitted by this user recently. Atlas officers have removed this user from the Atlas VOMS as a precaution and will ask him to get a new certificate.08-05-2008

2) Frederic Brochu's account has been compromised on UK RAL Tier1 reported on 08-06-2008. His DN is "/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Cambridge/L=UCS/CN=frederic brochu" with FQAN /atlas, and mapped into usatlas4 in default OSG There is so far no evidence that the private key of the certificate of both users has been compromised. Atlas security officer agreed to suspend this user from Atlas VOMS server.

---++ 08-19-2008 Advisory for OSG Security Contacts

<verbatim>
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

OSG security contacts,

This is a follow-up to the OSG security advisories sent August 6
regarding ssh attacks against grid sites in Europe and the US.

Please be aware that this widespread security incident is ongoing.

The attacker(s) have been stealing ssh keys to compromise accounts and
using local kernel exploits to gain root access.  Rootkits have been
installed and ssh keys have been systematically stolen and used to
compromise further sites.  Some sites report only account compromises
(no root escalation) and some other have simply detected unsuccessful
ssh scans.

At this time, no OSG systems are confirmed to be compromised, but at
least one OSG CE is suspected compromised.  The incident and the
investigation are ongoing.  If you are aware of any security
compromise affecting OSG (for example, if grid certificates are
suspected to be compromised), please immediately report it to
security@opensciencegrid.org.  The OSG security team will be
communicating individually with the security contacts of resources
suspected to be compromised.

Please note that the security of services and resources accessed
through OSG is primarily the responsibility of the service and
resource providers. Please do work immediately with your site's
incident response team regarding any security incident on your
systems, as well as let security@opensciencegrid.org know about
it. The OSG incident response team primarily fulfills a coordination
role and will work with you and your site security teams as such.

All sites should check their status and actively monitor for ssh
connection attempts from suspicious IP addresses and instances of
suspicious ssh keys, files, and malware as described below.  We also
encourage sites to use firewalls to restrict ssh access to OSG
systems, so that ssh connections are allowed only from trusted hosts.

Artifacts found on compromised hosts include:

* .p2rc: config file setting aliases for copying data by ssh and with
   ssh-keys provided
* .phalanx2: loader of the rootkit and probably backdoor
* .sniff: sniffer log
* sshgrab.py: python script for collecting ~/.ssh dirs and shell
  histories of all users if readable

CERNCERT-20080805 [UPDATE 5] received:

<pre>
*******************************************************
* What's new since the last update (Thu 2008-08-20 )? *
*******************************************************

- Further attacks discovered
- New patterns
- New suspicious IP addresses
- Updated tools

******************************
* Further attacks discovered *
******************************

- New suspicious IP addressed revealed a suspicious connection to/from CERN on
2008/05/26-23:00:39 UTC+2. The account linked with this connection has been
suspended. The account belongs to a system manager at physto.se.
The user changed his password at CERN on 2008-07-10, and it is believed the
attacker has not connected since then.

- On Sep 3, it was discovered that the department physto.se at
Stockholm University (130.242.128.0/24, 130.237.209.0/24) has had password
sniffers installed on several machines since a root intrusion on May 15.

While physto.se don't run any grid systems and the intruder has shown
no interest for grid systems, all grid certificates belonging to
physto.se users will be revoked as a precaution.

These include at least

	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Jorgen Sjolin
	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Karl Gellerstedt
	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Torbjorn Moa
	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Christian Ohm
	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Marianne Johansen
	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Philippe Mermod
	/O=Grid/O=NorduGrid/OU=physto.se/CN=Henrik Johansson

Of these, all but the last are members of the ATLAS VO. The last DN
only belongs to a local Swedish IceCube VO.

**************************
* Common attack patterns *
**************************

It has been discovered that successful connections to the backdoor may
produce the following syslog message (usually in /var/log/secure, /var/log/message):

---------------8<------------------
sshd[XXXX]: Disconnecting: Bad packet length 1883783500.
---------------8<------------------
(where XXXX is the PID of sshd)

It is possible to remotely check for signs of the backdoor using the script
"phalanx2_trigger-1.0.sh", but please note the script will generate a false
positive message in the log files "Bad packet length 1883783500." of the machine
that is being remotely checked.

The password collector used by the attackers has also been found at:

/usr/include/linux/.cache/cl

************************************************

**************************
* Attacks are continuing *
**************************

NCSA kindly reported that more attacks were very recently detected (timestamps are UTC/GMT -5 hours):

"We discovered four compromised accounts using public key authentication
over the weekend and today.  The remote IP addresses that they were
coming from are:

64.27.17.70    - vpn2.pcwerk.com
69.130.104.157 - h69-130-104-157.lkvlms.dsl.dynamic.tds.net

69.130.80.36   - h69-130-80-36.kgldga.dsl.dynamic.tds.net

One of the accounts downloaded the nfsshell.tar.gz tool.  An account also
had the following ssh key added to their authorized_keys file on Sept. 6th:

That is the same key that was added in the uchicago.edu incident back from
the report at http://hep.uchicago.edu/admin/report_072808.html

There seems to be an automated procedure running through ssh keys
and running the remote commands "id" and "uname -a" (most likely the
sshcrawl.py script).  Here is an example of what we have seen in log
files:

The biggest culprit for logins and attempted logins seems to be from the
machine 64.27.17.70 (vpn2.pcwerk.com).  I'll probably try to contact someone
at that site (located in California) tomorrow and see if I can get any
info from them."

CERNCERT-20080805 [UPDATE 7] received:

<verbatim>
** This message is sent to the CSIRTs of affected grid infrastructures and sites **

Dear CSIRTs,

The information below was kindly provided by the DFN CERT (NREN in Germany), the
SWITCH CERT (NREN in Switzerland), the EGEE Operational Security Coordination
Team, the OSG security team, CfA Harvard, ISI University of South California,
CERN security team and several CSIRTs from various sites.

*******************************************************
* What's new since the last update (Thu 2008-09-09 )? *
*******************************************************

- Further attacks discovered
- New suspicious IP addresses
- Updated tools

******************************
* Further attacks discovered *
******************************

* NCSA

More accounts have been discovered compromised at NCSA since the last update.
The attacker logged in using public keys, and followed the known attack
patterns: short, non-interactive SSH sessions.

* CERN
- heracles.cern.ch (root compromise)

The attacker logged in from a known suspicious IP address, which raised
suspicion. After preliminary investigations, it appears the attacker obtained
root access at least on May 25 from a privileged user account related to Mc Gill
University.

No rootkit was found, but the suspicious IP addresses used by the attacker have
been added to the list of known suspicious IP addresses.

- A large number of other unsuccessful SSH connection attempts (via public 
keys), against several presumably unrelated hosts, from known suspicious IP 
addresses, have been detected at CERN. The latest attack attempt was 2008-09-15 
at 07:42 UTC+2.

  The attacker concentrated on the following accounts: 'alex', 'pablo',  'sdr2', 
'yepes',  'amc', 'davatz', 'MaGiC' and 'biland'.

* McGill University

McGill University has detected an additional root compromised machine, running
the phalanx2 rootkit. The attacker connected as root using public key on Sep 09, 
from the 69.130. network block.

The machine has been cleaned, however it is not clear how/when the attacker
obtained root access.


************************************************
* New suspicious IP addresses as of 2008-09-09 *
************************************************

It is believed the attacker also logged in from:

- 83.134.152.127
- 209.181.242.70
- 216.184.13.238
- 69.130.104.157
- 69.130.136.116
- 69.130.130.117
- 69.130.104.49

Note that there are now 7 IP addresses in the 69.130 network block. Any
connection from this location should be treated as suspicious and reported.

The known list of suspicious IP addresses is now:

- 69.130.104.157 - h69-130-104-157.lkvlms.dsl.dynamic.tds.net
- 69.130.182.213 - h69-130-182-213.cytnin.dsl.dynamic.tds.net
