---++Survey of OSG VOs Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Statement

This OSG security team conducted a survey of OSG VOs to ensure that security policies regarding VO user management are known and being adhered to. Specifically we considered VO's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

---+++Questions to VOs
   1. Does your VO have an AUP in place that users have to agree to? If so, please provide us the appropriate link and update the entry on OIM. (Second part of question is asked if no appropriate link provided on OIM for the VO's AUP on OIM)
   2. Does your VO use a pilot job framework (e.g. glideinWMS) that allow users to get certificate free access to OSG?
   3. What procedures do you have in place so that the users are aware of and record their agreement to your VO's AUP?
   4. Are your users aware of the OSG AUP (http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86)?

---+++Responses from VOs
---++++DOSAR
(Horst Severini)

   1. We don't currently, since we have a very small user community and we literally know everyone personally, so we didn't think that was necessary until now.
   2. No, we do not.
   3. We don't, but see below.
   4. I had seen this before, but never really put much thought into it. But we should probably start using this for DOSAR in the future. Would that be okay? (Our answer was Yes)
---++++CSIU
(Scott Teige )

CSIU has no users. This will probably change at some point and we’ll be sure all of this is properly in place.
---++++glast.org
(Michael Kuss)

   1. Yes, we have an AUP, the entry on OIM is updated.
   2. The VO uses Grid resources through the DIRAC inter-ware. This software framework is extensively used by HEP communities and complies with security standards of LHC computing applications (DIRAC was developed by the LHCb experiment but has since matured to be entirely independent). As such, all DIRAC jobs use the DIRAC WMS which utilizes a pilot job framework (DIRACWMS). Access to OSG resources is only granted to users that authenticate themselves to the DIRAC server instance (which determines the role of each user). For the case of the glast dot org, jobs are submitted with shifter credentials (this is however not a robot certificate, but a real verifiable personal certificate).
   3. Users have to sign the AUP once a year.
   4. Strictly speaking of the link, we assume only those which have an OSG certificate have read the AUP of the link.  But, you may notice that the AUP's of the VO and of OSG are identical.  We also broadcast the explicit note of OSG of some months ago that, if not already obvious, bit coin mining on the grid is not allowed by any AUP.
