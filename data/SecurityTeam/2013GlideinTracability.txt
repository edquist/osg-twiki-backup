---++ Security exercise to assess and understand user/job traceability 

A number of Virtual Organizations (VOs)  are submitting job on behalf of their user by using pilot job framework, for e.g. glidein WMS. A job owner is still the person on whose behalf the job is executed and he/she is responsible for the behavior of the job. Hence being able to identify an individual user has been important. This has been traditionally been done by using X.509 digital user certificates. These user certificates are part of the job payload and are individually authenticated and authorized by the resource providers. Since the certificates are associated with individual users, it has been fairly straightforward for the sites to make connections between a executable/job to an individual.

However there is a growing trend for VOs to move away from the model of requiring every individual to get a user certificates. This is especially true for smaller/newer users/VOs since this eliminates the learning curve of understanding and getting the X.509 certificates. With technologies like glidein frontend and factory provided and hosted by OSG, this tread has been accelerating. However without the user certificates being part of the job payload the OSG resource providers are only able to get the identify of the pilot job submission systems. This implies they might be able to track the problem back to only the VO.  However from the OSG security perspective it is very important for each action of using a grid resource is traceable back to a particular user and we are able to get contact information for him/her. The goal of this exercise is hence to understand what information is needed from the VO, which log files might assist them, and what information is missing. 

As the first step we focus on the use of glideinWMS frontend

---+++ VOs using glideinWMS frontend

Typically glidein frontend logs are located at /var/log/gwms-frontend and which can be configured using /etc/gwms-frontend/frontend.xml. However the frontend logs contain information of the communication between the front end and the factory and do not much help with the traceability of a particular job. The frontend configuration file will however be able to tell you which factory you are communicating with and the list of sites that your frontend is able to submit to.

The more important logs in terms of tractability comes from HTCondor. Typically the configuration files are in /etc/condor/condor_config and /etc/condor/config.d/*. The log files are typically located at /var/log/condor/. These along with condor_history command (files /var/lib/condor/spool/) will help the frontend admin track the sites a particular users jobs was finally completed at.

The admin will have to find a mechanism external to OSG (e.g. system logs) to provide local user and login information.

---++++ Missing information 

   * Condor_history together with schedd and match logs may be able to provide the last location where the job ran at. However it does not seem to record all the locations where a job runs.  
   * Is it possible to match to a particular VO job from the worker node. Does the site has to rely on the VO or can some additional information be recorded in the site logs for e.g. what is the cluster ID of the remote job, which fronend it was submitted from

---++++ Other potential issues
   * Log rotation is filesize based rather than time based. This could cause the logs to rotate out before the 3 months period on heavily used VO frontends.

---++ Security Exercise

The exercise will work as follows:

   1. We will pretend a site admin has contacted the frontend admin saying that a user job submitted to particular WN at a site was 'behaving badly' during some time interval. Since the site only sees the pilot job this is the only information the admin is able to provide.
   2. Given this information can you as the frontend admin trace this bad behavior to one frontend user. (If not could this atleast narrow down to a small set of users.)
   3. Can we then figure out the users contact information and how he authenticated into the frontend.
   4. Specifically can we figure out what IP(s) the user logged in from, the executable s/he might have run.
   5. Given a time period, can we then identify which other sites the user's job ('bad behaving' or otherwise) might have run at.

We understand that we may or may not be able to find all these information and we might need to get help from the factory through which the pilot jobs were submitted. By doing this exercise we want to identify the gaps that might exist in achieving traceability when using
glideins. Additionally, if there are some changes that could be made in the software stack (both glidein and condor) which will make the job traceability easier to achieve (e.g. adding more logging information, providing some tools to parse and co-relate different logs), we wish to
identify them and make recommendations to the software team.

---+++ Exercise with OSG XSEDE front end
Will be conducted on Friday March 29, 2013. We propose the following schedule: 
   1. We start with a short meeting (30 mins) at 10 am CDT (8am PDT) to go over the details of the exercise and discuss any issues/questions.
   2. Then we will let you work on the drill on your schedule for the next few hours
   3. We convene back at 3pm CDT (1pm PDT) for a 1 hr meeting. Agenda would be to understand the gaps in conducting job traceability and make some initial recommendation for improving the situation.

---++++ Findings from the drill

   * Condor history and Gratia accounting logs were used to provide the information.
   * Given just the timestamp and the worker node were the problem was noticed,  we do not have enough information to tell which jobs ran on which glideins. Without knowing the glidein pilot job that is associated with the 'misbehaving' job, timestamp alone is not able to identify a particular user since 2 or more glideins running at the same time om this node.
   * Condor history logs rolls over too quickly. By default 20MB is kept and  rotated twice. Hence the settings was changed to the following to store more history data.
<pre class="file">
     MAX_HISTORY_LOG = 1000000000
     ENABLE_HISTORY_ROTATION = True
     MAX_HISTORY_ROTATIONS = 5
</pre>
   * Job/machine match information is lost when new matches are made (jobs coming out of hold state or after preemption). The following settings were added (in condor config) to keep the 10 last matches:
<pre class="file">
     SYSTEM_JOB_MACHINE_ATTRS = GLIDEIN_ResourceName, Name, StartdIpAddr
     SYSTEM_JOB_MACHINE_ATTRS_HISTORY_LENGTH = 10
</pre>
   This helps, but we probably also need to keep JobStartDate and maybe other attributes as well. It can also make the queries really long.

Below is a detailed information from the drill

Test 1
------

Given information:

    When:          Wed 3/27 ~noon CDT
    Sitename:      Firefly
    Node hostname: c1023.local
    Node IP:       10.158.10.23


As these jobs were submitted before we extended our local Condor
history log, the log had already rolled over. But we can still
find summary records in Gratia. This will work for jobs which
ran and then were removed. If the job was put on hold, either
manually or automatically, the Gratia records will not be
complete. The query used was:


SELECT
  LocalJobId,
  LocalUserId,
  CommonName,
  WallDuration,
  StartTime,
  EndTime,
  SubmitHost,

  JobUsageRecord JUR

WHERE
  ProbeName REGEXP 'condor:osg-xsede.grid.iu.edu' AND
  JUR.StartTime >= '2013-03-27 00:00:00' AND
  JUR.EndTime <= '2013-03-27 23:59:59' AND
  Host LIKE 'c1023%'

Note that we do not have enough information to tell if these jobs
ran on the same glidein or not. In this case, the timestamps
overlap so we know that there was 2 or more glideins running
at the same time om this node.

One missing piece of data is site name. It might be available in Gratia
