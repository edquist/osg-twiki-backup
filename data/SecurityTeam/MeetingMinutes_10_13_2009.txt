---++ Meeting Minutes
*Igor*
   * *Action Item*: OSG Identity survey
   * merging of GOC templates into GUMS 1.3 
      * takes GOC template + gums.config = new gums.config. 
      * source file decided which portions are overwrriten or not. Igor has not decided if source file is empty what to do. Option 1 : is to generate a source file from goc tempate and then ask the site admin to manually modify the source file, which will be used for later merges. 
      * *Action Item*: ask Hover how they do this for GUMS 1.4  Although it is pretty different because when GUMS 1.4 is installed first time, it spits out a new source file. 
      * *Action Item* finish the coding by next week so we can have a prototype to test
   * transitioning to HTTPS
      * agreed to sign the packages instead of using https on VDT and GOC
      * PGP signing of software is standard. RPMs can already be signed by PGP. An issue is we have many packages and we aim to sign every package and every tarball. 
      * what is the risk of having the passphrase in memory? Ideally, distribution and signing must be separate machines.  ideally signing machine must be off-network. 
      * Jim: TG does not sign distributions. what are the minimum security requirements on a machine that distributes software? we do not have requirements tailored towards specific machines. 
      * what is the timeline Alain should achieve this? we are not eliminating phishing attack. An attacker can get a valid commercial certificate for a phishing web site and distribute a bogus certificate. (*Action Item*: how does commercial CAs sign cert requests? do CAs try to eliminate phishing attacks by refusing suspicious domain names?) We are not eliminating corruption of the software caches because any attacker compromises the software cache can use the automated key to sign bogus packages. 
      * Mine: medium priority to high priority. Alain should implement this before next major release 1.4. Although our protection has weaknesses, it creates burden on the attacker to generate an attack. Thus, they act as deterrents. Attacker is forced to get commercial certs which he has to pay for. Once he compromises the software cache, he has to figure out the automated key to sign malicious software. these are good barriers to make it harder for an attacker. 
      * * Action Item*: Mine will reply to Alain's email. 
      * *Action Item*: Jim will send us TG's minimum requirements on sensitive systems. 
   * GOC HTTPS
      * they started using https. who is responsible at GOC for transitioning? 
      * *Action Item* : Security team should move their PGP key distribution from twiki to the server which is protected with commercial CA. 

*Jim*
   * *Action Item*: run the test on yellow sites
   * *Action Item*: Ask Kyle Gross whether newly detecetd sites are still active in OSG or not. We will wait until the end of this week to send the updated list to EB 
   * * Action Item* send out the announcement from Romain. new information   
   * *Action Item*: Mine will send the list of vulnerability lists watched by the team. 

*Anand*
   * Advisory watch is Anand's turn this week
   * *Action Item* Mine will look at last week's advisories if she missed any
   * Drills are over. Good results
   * *Action Item*: Anand will create a spreadsheet and wrap up the drills. he will include the problems we faced before and during the drill. 
   * *Action Item*: Anand will email the GUMS problems to Hover and Dantong and Mine
 
*Doug*
   * at OGF 
 
Anand: 20 sites are done. spreadsheets are done
problems we discovered. before running the tests 
Doug is in OGF.
