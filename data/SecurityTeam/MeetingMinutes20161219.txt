   * The NOvA contact person Alex Himmel thinks he may know what the cause is for NOvA users requesting CILogon certificates multiple times per day instead of once per week like we designed.  He will follow up in the new year.
   * glexec is failing at JINR (in Russia) on jobs submitted from Fermilab using CILogon Basic CA certificates.  I believe that is because CILogon Basic CA's cert & CRLs are not accepted in EGI.  We're directing them to the NIKHEF experts to advise them on what to do, possibly including using brand new software (for lcmaps and for Argus) for accepting a whiltelist of VOs along with IOTA CAs such as CILogon Basic CA.  If we had CILogon Silver CA it would not be an issue.
