---++!! Audit of OSG RA Agents, Jan 2010

%TOC%

---+++ Introduction
In order to maintain the integrity of the DOEGrids certificate process it is
necessary to audit the procedures and records occasionally.
The previous audit was two years ago in Dec. 2007 and now we
are starting a sampling audit including all agents who have issued
certificate in the past two years.

Doug,

I am not on my other computer, so I can't check for email verification, but considering this was 
during an OSG Education conference when lots of certs are created, I assumed this was done 
via phone call.

I looked at my statement for said day and did place a call to John McGee (engage VO) at 
nearly the minute that the certificate was issued. (I assume there could be a slight difference 
between clock times)  I'm not sure if this helps, but I will check from my other computer later, 
though I am certain that this is the call that was made for the cert in question. (I'd have no other 
reason to call John McGee at that exact moment)

Kyle
