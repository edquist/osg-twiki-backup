---++Meeting Minutes

*Igor*
   * Only ucsd, fnal, nebraska and sprace has glexec installed. The push is for tier2 to get glexec working. Tier2s installed the script but never tested. Sites do not care and possibly the only lab that wants to deploy glexec is fermilab. CMS is keen on getting this done. 

   * VO packaging project. We finished this project but I am not certain how this tool is used now. Igor will talk with Rob and send an update and announcement to sites. Igor finished gums  v1.3 and gums 1.4 was already finished. 

*Doug*
   * RA agents meeting tomorrow. We have approx 30 agents. At last meeting, people agreed instructions are reasonable. Doug is doing the auditing process, he picked two certificates per agent. he will keep it on twiki. 
   * GOC figured out how to work out with the image to replicate the ESNet database. 

*Anand*: 
   * Pakiti is done. Anand will pick some pilot sites and compare against some test sites. ask if they are ready to test or not. the current server gets the vulnerability lists from redhat oval definition. we have to manually synch up with the database. we will find out which OS types are mainly used and we need to add those vulnerability databases to the server. we will start with tier3 sites.  
   * *Action Item* Mine will ask catalin to help with testing pakiti. Mine will get Dan to set up a meeting with t3 sites and invite the T3 coordinators

*Jim*
   * Nothing new to report. he is doing back-analysis of CA operations. 
   * *Action Item* generate a spreadsheet before the end of this week. 
   * * Action Item* send out the announcement about openssl to OSG sites. 
*Mine*  
   * RSV individual expiry probe is already optional. The non-optional RSV probe has the name expiry probe. ask Arvind if changing probe name is possible. this might be causing site admins to think their crl has expired. 
   * what about having CRL central distribution. central distribution will be the primary point. some ca cannot handle high volume CRL requests. We all think this is a better solution against network problems. Original ca address should be used as a last resort. if GOC does not have the latest version, then the code can go back to ca web site. 
      * if we change fetch-crl too much, who will maintain it. This is a reasonable request to make to EGEE. they can so maintain it for us. 
   * The change in the openssl distribution package. we need to figure out the structure in our ca bundle process. probably we will have to change the process slightly. vdt-ca-manage have to be changed too. 
   * what happens if we put the ca certificates directly into operating systems. mozilla and microsoft are two entry points, we do not care about microsoft. to get into OS has very stringent legal requirements and a costly process. there is no distinguish between service and user certs for root certs. this will open up the whle OS users to attacks by IGTF service certs. We have the same risk by distributing CA roots via TERENA repository, but at least it is a smaller community.
