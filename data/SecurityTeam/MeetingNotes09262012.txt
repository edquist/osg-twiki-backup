---++Meeting Notes

*Anand*

   * SHA-2 Transition. CRL tests. Works with openssl 0.9.8 SL5. DOEGRids SHA-2 CA news: The SHA2 CA will be kept up as long as DOEGrids CA is online. in 6-8 weeks DOEGrids will review whether they can provide a SHA-2 signed intermediate CA.  Check with Patty on October 19th about intermediate CA progress. Anand made a new CA release with CRLs signed with SHA-2 since 9/26/2012. Anand will make sure this CRL will not get into production. 

   * We are getting ahead with the new IGTF release. It is in ITB cycle. Anand will be the contact person for CA update failures. 

   * For the CA layout change. Anand updated the project plan. Alan Sill updated the Voms-admin installations. There are still 10 VOs which needs updating. All the VOs are ready for the upgrade. Our current deadline is Nov 30. Noone of The VOs complained except for Alan. We will gently push the VOs. 
   * Review of ST& E items
   * Beast attack review and helping Bestman. 
   * Verify that Vomses file can have multiple dn entries per each Voms servers. Kevin tested that a client with vomses file with multiple entries still can authenticate. where else do we use the vomses file. The easiest thing to do is to create a new vomses file with multiple entries and test in ITB. 

*Kevin*
   * java vulnerability got released. 
   * new zero day java vulnerability. Not high risk. same as the previous vulnerability. affects the browser and the applets. put it in the regular 
   * EGI/OSG drill. finished grading the EGI/OSG drill, it is on twiki. Do not know when EGI will release. Ask EGI if they could verify whether the sites which claimed to never receive any jobs did indeed receive jobs or not.  
   * Pakiti : Project Plan updated. made a patch and a source rpm. hand over the software Friday hopefully 9/28. Will start writing the documentation. 
   * Condor vulnerability: start searching with myosg and find CEs. seems to be lots of ces do not accept jobs form fermilab VO. can we run under GOC MIS VO? Open a ticket and run jobs under that VO. Email Dan and copy Mine to ask about what to do with vulnerable sites. 
   * Site vulnerability and patch levels. Find out what are we doing with sites who are vulnerable to Gratia exploit. GOC sent tickets to each site. How security team got involved our kept out of this. We were not emailed when those tickets went out.
