---++ Project Plan for 2012 Security Drill (Tier3)
---+++ Problem Statement
As part of security teams activities, we periodically run so-called "Security  Drills". In this round we are targeting smaller/tier 3 OSG sites.

---+++ Goal
The objective of drill is to improve the quality of the response to grid sites to security incidents, in particular:

   * Compliance with the OSG Incident Response Procedure
   * Timeline and quality of the response
   * Ensuring that the incident response communication channels are  working as expected
   * Ensuring all relevant participants are informed


There are several benefits to the participating sites. They gain:
   * a better understanding of the grid incident response procedure
   * a better understanding of the way communication is organized during incidents
   * some hands-on experience in dealing with a (test) security incident
   * a better view on how sites usually react, what they expect from the affected sites, what information they provide the OSG/VO with


---+++ Project Team
   * Security Team: Anand  (Lead), Mine
   * Participants: OSG Tier 3 Site Admis 

---+++ Deliverable from the project:
   * Improve understanding of OSG Incident Response Procedure among sites
   * Recommendations (if any) for participating sites and tweaking to OSG security team
   * A report documenting the procedure and results on twiki

---+++ Schedule
   * Effort: 5 FTE week, Participating Tier 3 Site admins 1FTE day/each
   * Project start : TBD
   * Project End Date: TBD
