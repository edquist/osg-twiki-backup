   * Java vulnerability. Service side high level vulnerability only affecting rmi subsystem. Sent email to vdt team to inquire if we use this vulnerable package. 
   * gsi-ssh vulnerability. check with GOC if the vulnerable version is used at cvmfs-login. 
   * CVMFS risk assessment. Art will give feedback today. 
   * Proxy lifetime discussion. It appears with voms-proxy-init we have no risk. With plain grid proxies , we may want to notify sites how to reject long-termed proxies. 
   * Cilogon risk assessment first draft is completed. Kevin will talk to HCC whether CIlogon Basic CA certs is sufficient. Mine will push on Glow whether they want to pursue this path.
