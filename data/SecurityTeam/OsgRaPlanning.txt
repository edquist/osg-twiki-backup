---+ OSG Registration Authority plans
We have planned, in the OSG Program of Work and subsequent proposals to establish a Registration Authority with [[http:?/www.doegrids.org][DOEGrids]] for OSG. Initialy this RA will replace the functions of the PPDG and iVDGL RA's as those projects (& funding) come to a close. This page will be used to publish and maintain the workplan for putting the OSG RA into effect.

---++ Overview
The general idea for the functions of the OSG RA is to have the initial service essentially just be a re-labelling of the PDPG and iVDGL procedures as the OSG procedures for the startup of the OSG RA.
We should also plan the evolution of the OSG RA service and guidance & interaction with DOEGrids for the longer term.

---+++ Purpose
The purpose of the OSG RA is to provide the authentication function for X509 certificate requests from users of OSG for personal or service certificates issued by the DOEGrids CA.  The definition of the scope and function for an RA is defined in the [[http://www.doegrids.org/Docs/CP-CPS.pdf][DOEGrids CP/CPS]].

---++ Significant dates
---+++ May 1, 2006
About May 1 the DOEGrids PMA will have a quarterly meeting and we intend to have an appendix for the CP/CPS covering the OSG RA ready for consideration and approval at that meeting.

---+++ July 1, 2006
OSG RA should be functional.

---++ Draft CP/CPS appendix for OSG RA
[[%ATTACHURL%/CPS-osg-v2.doc][Draft V2 OSG RA appendix]]
d91 5
Notable items in the appendix.
	* definition of community, O.3
	* authentication procedure, O.4.1
	* logging, O.4.4
	* revocation procedure, O.5

Questions:
	* RA web page & URL
	* contact info - probably should include the GOC
	* address for logging RA actions



---++ To Do Items
	1. Prepare Draft OSG RA appendix for DOEGrids - due April 15
		* [[%ATTACHURL%/CPS-osg-v1.doc][Draft V1 OSG RA appendix]], [[%ATTACHURL%/CPS-osg-v2.doc][Draft V2 OSG RA appendix]]
		* will describe plan and procedures for agents and sponsors for the distributed OSG RA.
		* a goal is to distribute as much of the RA function as possible consistent with maintaining the integrity and operational performance goals of the RA
		* Who from OSG should approve the OSG appendix? (ET & Council)
	2. Workflow description & diagram - due April 24
	3. Display OSG-registered VOs on the person certificate request web page (pki1.doegrids.org) - in progress.
		* Modify cert request notification email to agents to include VO name.
	4. Revocation script - in progress

---++ Wishlist
	* Include server domain name on the services certificate request web page (pki1.doegrids.org).
		* Modify cert request notification email to agents to include domain name.
	* Include identification of RA agents and/or sponsors with the OSG Operations VO/Resource/Support Center registration procedure.
	* Request list display: separate/sort by affiliation, OU=people vs services

---++ Example workflow
---+++ OU=People illustration
Description of elements on diagram below.
	* DOEGrids CA 1 represents the Certificate Manager (CM) component of the CA which does the actual signing of new certificate.
	* Registration Manager is the CA component that has the web site that subscribers use to make requests and agents use to approve requests (and other agent functions).
		* The RM will display the list of VOs registered with OSG.
	* Agents within the Support Centers receive notification of the requests by email.
		* The email subject line will include the name of the VO so they can be easily filtered by the different support center agents.
	* Subscriber is the term for a person requesting a new certificate.
	* Sponsor is the term for a person who can verify the identity of a Subscriber and the fact that the Subscriber really did make a request.
	* VO Sponsor DB represents the list of people authorized to be a Sponsor for a request. Could be maintained separately for each VO or could be a list for several VOs.
		* Fermilab uses the central user account database to identify authorized sponsors.
		* iVDGL maintains a web page list of sponsors.
		* It could be an ad-hoc list or have sponsor role validated during the registration process.

%ATTACHURL%/ra-flow-060419.gif

	1. Person submits request for certificate
		* both web form and script interface post request to Registration Manager
	2. Registration Manager (RM) sends notification of request to Agents and to the Subscriber
		* If email address in request bounces or is otherwise non-functional the request will be cancelled.  If feasible, an attempt to notify the subscriber will be made (perhaps via submitted Sponsor information).
	3. Agent retrieves and evaluates request at RM web site.
		* Agent clicks the "assign to me" on the request so that other agents know it is being processed.
		* If the "assigned to" agent decides they can not process it for some reason they should click the "unassign" link and notify someone that the request needs attention.
	4. Request is checked and validated
		* a) agent chooses a valid sponsor
		* b) agent sends signed email to sponsor asking for confirmation of request
		* c) sponsor checks with Subscriber if they actually made request
		* d) Subscriber replies to Sponsor
		* e) Sponsor confirms (or denies) that Subscriber really made the request. (via digitally signed email or telephone)
	5. Agent approves (or rejects) the request at the RM
	6. RM sends request to CM to be signed.
	7. CM signs certificate and returns it to RM.
	8. RM notifies Subscriber that certificate is available.
	9. Subscriber downloads certificate.
