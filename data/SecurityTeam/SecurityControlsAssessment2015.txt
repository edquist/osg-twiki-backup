---+ 2 SecurityTeam Controls Assessment 2015
---++ 2.1 Overview
---++ 2.2 Management Controls
---+++ 2.2.1 Integrated Computer SecurityTeam Management
---++++ 2.2.1.1 Roles and Responsibilities - Line Organization
   * New organization chart at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=1131, updated on February 2015.
      * The Education Coordinator role is described in the SecurityTeam Plan, but does not appear in the new organization chart. 
      * The Campus Coordinator does appear in the chart, but the role is not described in the SecurityTeam Plan.

---++++ 2.2.1.2 Awareness for OSG managers
   * Document at https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=573 could use updating. Document has not been updated since 2007. Working on a new version to get it ready for 2016.
      * Some concepts are already in the SecurityTeam Plan (duplication?). Roles and Responsibilities don't match with the organization chart or the descriptions in the SecurityTeam Plan. 
      * After updating, document needs to be shared with the OSG staff.

---++++ 2.2.1.3 Email Rob Quick (See questions and answers from 2012)
   * Does the OSG have the ability to bar a user, a VO, or a site? _Answers from Rob Quick, Operations Coordinator_
      * Users - The CA can revoke a certificate for a users thus barring him from using the cert. The VO can remove him from VOMS effectively barring him from using OSG. Neither of these are OSG actions, the most we can do is ask the RA or VO to do this.
      * VOs - We can remove them from the VO Package, stop publishing their VO information, and ask sites and GUMS admins to remove them also. This is not a quick process, but after they are removed at the site/GUMS they will no longer be able to use OSG resources. This is not a single operation and dependent more on the sites taking action than OSG.
      * Sites - We can stop publishing their information in GOC services, making them invisible to most automated discovery methods. This would leave them functional but not easy to find. We could also revoke host/service certs (only if the use DOEGrids Certs). This would effectively stop operation, at least until they obtained other IGTF credentials. Removing sites from the !GlideIn Factory would stop jobs from this submission mechanism, but not all jobs. 
   * Where are the awareness materials? add reference to security plan? (AUP)
   * OSG CA accredited and transition started on late 2015

---+++ 2.2.2 SecurityTeam Processes
---++++ 2.2.2.1 Computer SecurityTeam Lifecycle Meeting
   * SecurityTeam team weekly meeting minutes are available [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SecurityTeam/WeeklySecurityMeetings][here]]

---++++ 2.2.2.2 Briefing of the Area Coordinators
   * Meeting minutes are made available, in addition, the security officer attends the weekly area coordinators meeting.
   * There is a weekly area coordinators meeting including the security officer. Are area coordinators need to inspect the meeting minutes?

---++++ 2.2.2.3 Risk Assessment
   * In progress

---++++ 2.2.2.4 Polices, Plans, and Procedures
   * Documents are available in docdb and wiki, but there should be an explicit list or location of pointers to which documents are included here. 
   * Not clear what checking signatures means for electronic documents. STOP HERE!

---++++ 2.2.2.5 Self Assessment
   * We need to schedule a formal self assessment.
   * Still true. Ask the SecurityTeam Officer if the assessment was already done or needs to be scheduled.

---++++ 2.2.2.6 Peer review
   * We should combine a peer review with the self assessment. CHTC --> group at Indiana. They have offered to do a peer review for us.

---+++ 2.2.3 Trust Relationships
---++++ 2.2.3.1 Approval
   * The appropriate document is now https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Operations/OIMRegistrationInstructions, updated the security plan. READ THE DOCUMENT!
   * Approval records are recorded in GOC tickets.

---++++ 2.2.3.2 Documentation
   * This control should be changed. Does not seem possible to have the executive director be able to personally verify all of OIM database.

---++++ 2.2.3.3 Clear roles and responsibilities
   * Contact information in OIM seems to be up to date. Perhaps an annual email to ask folks to review their info would help? Seems to work for some of the domain registrars.

---++++ 2.2.3.4 Review
   * Again I think this is referring to verifying all of OIM, which seems impractical. This control could use some clarification.
   * Email all the VOs contact people could help?

---++ 2.3 Operational Controls
---+++ 2.3.1 SecurityTeam Training and Awareness
---++++ 2.3.1.1 Role based training
   * Changed interval to yearly.
   * SecurityTeam training sessions held at OSG all hands meeting. In 2015, training sessions were held.
   * New VOs are getting initial security training session. This is tracked via tickets.

---++++ 2.3.1.2 Regular OSG Core SecurityTeam Phone Conference
   * SecurityTeam team meeting minutes are reviewed regularly be security team members.
   * Are those minutes meeting different from the weekly meeting? STOP HERE!

---++++ 2.3.1.3 OSG and Other SecurityTeam Mailing Lists
   * These lists are in place:
      * INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * INCIDENT-REPORT-L@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * OSG-SECURITY-SOFTW-VULNERABILITY@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * OSG-SECURITY-TEAM@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * security@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * SECURITY-DISCUSS-L@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG
      * TG-SECURITY@opensciencegrid.org
   * Seems like most of these lists are unused, and could be replaced with the ticket system in incident response procedures. (Valid for 2015)
   * Check the archive list, if they haven't been used in the last year, why keep it? (STOP HERE!)

---++++ 2.3.1.4 SecurityTeam Briefings and Discussions at Consortium Meetings
   * SecurityTeam training sessions were held at OSG All Hands meeting at NorthWestern University on March 2015.

---+++ 2.3.2 Incident Response
---++++ 2.3.2.1 Incident Planning
   * Incident response process documented in SecurityTeam.IncidentResponseProcess. Right now still relies on email lists, but should probably be switched to use security tickets.

---++++ 2.3.2.2 Incident Discovery and Mandatory Reporting
   * A full security drill is being planned. The plan needs to be discussed with GOC team. STOP HERE!

---++++ 2.3.2.3 Invocation of the Incident Response Plan
   * Logs have been reviewed as part of the Traceability project, but a full security drill should be conducted. Same as 2.3.2.2

---++++ 2.3.2.4 Incident Handling
   * Logs have been reviewed as part of the Traceability project, but a full security drill should be conducted. Same as 2.3.2.2

---++++ 2.3.2.5 Incident Analysis and reporting
   * Logs have been reviewed as part of the Traceability project, but a full security drill should be conducted. Same as 2.3.2.2
