   * The SecurityTeam twiki is finally separated out and protected, and most of the links fixed up.  There's only a small number of pages left on the Security twiki, all the cruft that nobody will ever look at again is on SecurityTeam.
   * After adding more job submission servers like I mentioned last week, there was an additional issue found: the "managed proxy" service (for service certificates) sets the proxy certs as read-only, so cigetcert leaves it alone.  When the list of trusted retrievers changed, cigetcert started failing because it noticed the change and wasn't allowed to update it on myproxy.  So this will be solved in the future by notifying the people running the managed proxy service to re-install on myproxy with the new trusted retrievers list.
   * Brian still thinks it is important to have a method for obtaining certificates for CEs that's extremely easy, since that's the first thing that small sites need to set up.  That could be reason enough to have one method for CEs and another for large complex sites.  Alternatively he suggested ways to have a host automatically request new certs, but requiring the site administrator to approve via a web interface.  He thinks that could be sufficient even for relatively large universities, if they can be approved in batches.
