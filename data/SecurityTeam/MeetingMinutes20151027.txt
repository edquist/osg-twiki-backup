   * I updated the requirements document for the ECP !IdP for Olga.
   * Still waiting on Jim Basney to do the changes to add the /OU= and optionally some /CN= after that for robot certs, and to change the added unique number with the first and last name to instead have /CN=UID:<uid>.
   * Did some minor revising on the CISR paper.
   * The oasis CRLs are being updated every 6 hours, but grid.cern.ch CRLs are now updated every 3 hours.  Should we change to match?
