Igor: you are leaving this Friday. jay finished the template. igor will work on the script for the template this week. Igor will look at the vdt getting rid of the vdt ca service

Doug: contingency planning is what happens if ca disappears. prioritize the active users from gratia records. this is already in gratia. getting the past records out of the database , gridadmin work. downloaded the requests and ordered them into mysql. data integrity checks. 
reports to generate from that. we can use the database to send reports and notifications to the users. esnet sends to agents , not enought o the users. we would like to send a notification is: email the vo admin when user is renewing; report to manager when new certs are issued; report to VO admin when request is issued. access logs from doegrids possibly today
