   * Wrote & gave talk at CISRC 16.  The talk went fine, but there was nobody else there talking about anything related.  It was mostly about people concerned about the sorry state of the computer security industry, why it's in the mess it is in, and what might possibly be able to be done about it.  It was somewhat interesting and I learned some stuff, but there was not much related to what I am interested in working on.
   * I found one security issue in cigetcert and made a new release for the code review.  The code review found a few more security issues and several good other suggestions so now I've got more work to do.
   * MyProxy production servers were set up but as far as I know the HA replication isn't yet finished.
