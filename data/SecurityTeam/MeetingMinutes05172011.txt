---++ Meeting Minutes 5/17/2011
   * Anand is still in India. 

*Jim*:
   * Need to subscribe the software security contacts to the listserv. 
   * Security Drill. Identified 4 sites that may be suitable for the drill. Sven is running the test this week whether the job can run on proposed atlas sites. He runs a small job to see if he has access control on the site. 
   * Next week: Jim will coordinate the drill. There is a grading the sites will be measured against.  Malware analysis is off the books this year. Doug wants to have Tier3 sites in the drill. Will notify GOC that an incident drill will happen. GOC will notify Jim as quick as possible. Malicious job will ping its controller.  
   * How will Sven/Jim notify sites that the incident started?
   * we will send a detailed email to sites on these are the steps you have to take in the initial notification email. 
   * the job has end of the week lifetime. does Sven have a web site on the drill details? 

*Marko*
   * Marko found out a possible solution for the OSG Goc tcket on firefox renegotiation . He will file this with esnet service desk.
      * GOC ticket is https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/viewer?id=10249. Apparently es.net tickets # PKI19204, 19207, and PKI TT
19212 are related, but Marco cannot see them.
      * This problem is described in http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-3555 and the general solution is described in http://tools.ietf.or/html/rfc5746     
      * It seems that to really fix this, DOEgrids would need to update their webserver software so that it is compliant with rfc5746. One way is to upgrade to a version of Apache >= 2.2.15 and OpenSSL >= 0.9.8m. The Apache changelog for 2.2.15 (http://mirror.nyi.net/apache//httpd/CHANGES_2.2) says
mod_ssl: Comprehensive fix of the TLS renegotiation prefix injection attack when compiled against OpenSSL version 0.9.8m or later.

      * Right now the DOEgrids page is running Netscape-Enterprise Server 6.2, at least according to the http headers returned from, for example, https://pki1.doegrids.org/ca/CertBasedSingleEnroll.html Haven't found a release date, but this software seems to be relatively old.
      * As a better temporary fix for Firefox 4 users, we might suggest that they set security.ssl.renego_unrestricted_hosts in about:config to "pki1.doegrids.org", although I haven't tested this yet. This might be better than changing the
  security.ssl.allow_unrestricted_renego_everywhere__temporarily_available_pref variable, which applies to all hosts. There is some discussion about this at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/744718.

   * Marko will find out if he will meet the end of May deadline on user documentation.
