---++ Authentication Infrastructure: Challenges and Work-To-Do
---+++The Problem
User management of access credentials. users complain the difficulty of managing credentials on desktop applications, most importantly in browsers and email clients.
   * exporting/importing the certificates from/into the browsers and email clients
   * inserting roots of trust into the browser CA certs. Although this is a general problem with the web environment, grid world makes a bit harder on the user because our CAs certificate do not get distributed by default in the browsers. 
   * moving certificates into the file system that can be accessed by grid application /.globus directory
     
---+++Proposed Solutions
---++++Separate Web and Grid applications and use non-certificate based access control in Web domain
Access control for web applications will be based on non-certificate based access credentials. The credentials can be username/password, or SAML tokens generated by openID or Shibboleth. 

%RED%*Pros*%ENDCOLOR%
   * Ease of use with well-known credentials such as username/password. 
   * Industry support of the widely-adopted credentials. Out-of-the-box support built into the web clients.
   
%RED%*Cons*%ENDCOLOR%
   * Less security: certificates are two-factor authentication methods. (something you know (passphrase) and something you have (private key)). the password based schemes are one-factor. Federation based solutions are dependent on whichever authentication method used by the home organization
   * Existing web applications that use certificates need to be modified. Some web pages already require certificates for authentication. These should be modified to use selected credentials.  
   * Some users will still use certificates for sensitive web applications. Some web applications with sensitive security needs, such as Pakiti and ticket viewers, will still be accessed by certificates because of higher security standards.    
   * Less-known technologies such as those based on federations may initially be hard to use and learn for the users. Also, forwarding used in federation based solutions is bad security practice.  

%RED% ToDo%EndColor%
   * What other access control mechanisms and credentials could be useful for our users? 
   * Which web applications are used currently? Are they mostly browser based? Keep in mind applications will change in future, but it is useful to understand what is used today. (is this possibly in the ID Mgmt workshop survey reports?)

 
---++++Use two separate certificates: one for web domain and one for the grid job submissions
Use two separate  
---++++Use certificates with all applications (web and grid) by implementing a certificate management software on the desktop
