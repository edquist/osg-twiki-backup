   * Finished tests with Garhan on tracing owner of job by pid. Will write up results of condor-ce drill this week.
   * Couldn't get the digicert admin interface to issue a personal cert with sha-1 manually. Opened a ticket and Darin from Digicert was cc'ed. Was fixed or problem went away on its own.
   * Updated OSG risk assessment matrix. Should updated document be saved to docdb as new version of old doc or as a new doc by itself?
   * setup a meeting with Tony and Joe to discuss the users' need to ssh into worker nodes to debug failed jobs
   * examine the gratia probe that is being retired. what information will we miss by losing this probe?

   * working on the writing a malicious job to test the glideinwms system. our goal is to test how easily a clever attacker can overwrite the log files. 
   * design a reasonable method for separating user accounts submitted by the same glideinwms pilot. due to lack of user certificates , all jobs will run under the same account.
