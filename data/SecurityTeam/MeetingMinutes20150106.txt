   * Finished tests with Garhan on tracing owner of job by pid. Will write up results of condor-ce drill this week.
   * Couldn't get the digicert admin interface to issue a personal cert with sha-1 manually. Opened a ticket and Darin from Digicert was cc'ed. Was fixed or problem went away on its own.
   * Updated OSG risk assessment matrix. Should updated document be saved to docdb as new version of old doc or as a new doc by itself?
