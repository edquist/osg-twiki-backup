We are sharing this information with you so you can use it to
better protect your systems and monitor for malicious activity, and

Computers that have an enabled telnet daemon that supports encryption
may be vulnerable to compromise. This is considered to be a critical
vulnerability with a CVSS rating of 10.

Steps to remediate the problem may include
  * disabling telnet,
