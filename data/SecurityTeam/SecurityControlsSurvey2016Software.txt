---++ Data Integrity

---+++ 1. Which core service or asset are you reporting for?

Data repositories that the OSG Software team needs to produce the OSG software stack:

   * Upstream software repository, hosted at UW
   * Subversion repository for OSG packaging sources, hosted at UW
   * Git repositories for OSG software sources, hosted at !GitHub
   * Git repository for configuration management data, hosted at UW
   * Koji service (used to build RPM packages and manage Yum repositories), hosted at UW
   * Yum repositories, hosted at University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison (UW) and Indiana University (IU)
   * (Unsupported but still available) Pacman caches and VDT website (vdt.cs.wisc.edu), hosted at UW

---+++ 2. Have you read the OSG Security Plan, Data Integrity section 2.3.3 within the past 12 months and understand your responsibilities for the proper handling of Sensitive Personal Data, Restricted Data, Limited Distribution Data and Public Data? See [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG Security Plan]]

Yes.

---+++ 3. If your service does not store, process, transmit any data, you may indicate it here and conclude the survey.  

We store, process, and transmit data.

---+++ 4. Are you the owner of the data? The data owner is responsible for collection, storage, and treatment of the data. Although you own the core service/process, there may be another person who owns the data. If so, please provide his/her name below, and answer the following questions with that person.

Yes, the OSG Software manager (currently, Tim Cartwright) owns the data.

---+++ 5. Please enter data name you own along with a very brief description and the data type. The data types are explained in Section 2.3.3 of the [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG Security Plan]].

| *Name* | *Backup policy* |
| Upstream software repository | Daily (UW AFS) |
| Subversion repository | Daily (UW AFS) |
| !GitHub software projects | Every 10 minutes from !GitHub to UW (custom script), daily within UW (AFS) |
| Git repository for ITB host data | Per commit to physically separate mirror host |

| VDT website | Daily (UW AFS) |

---+++ 7. Backups

---++++ 7A. How long do you retain the back-ups?

---++++ 7B. How do you ensure that your data back-ups are stored correctly, protected and restorable?

For some backups, we receive email notification when they occur, along with notification of any failures; others, there is nothing. Generally speaking, we do not test restorations due to lack of effort.

---+++ 8. Please list your on-call support email address and/or phone number in case of emergencies, such as unexpected power loss, security attacks or natural disasters.

We do not maintain on on-call presence. Possible contact points are:

   * Tim Cartwright <cat@cs.wisc.edu>, (608) 262-4002
   * The Software team (and interested other people) in general: OSG Software <osg-software@opensciencegrid.org>
   * Aaron Moate <moate@cs.wisc.edu>, CHTC lead system administrator
   * Erin Grasmick <egrasmic@cs.wisc.edu>, CHTC system administrator
   * The UW Computer Systems Lab (in the CS department): <lab@cs.wisc.edu> (also not on call)

---+++ 9. Are you aware of any attacks against the data? What do you think is the biggest threat against the data?

I am not aware of any attacks. The biggest threats are accidental loss or corruption.

---+++ 10. If you own Restricted Data please answer the following questions.

To date, we identified the following individual files that contain restricted data on our systems:

   * Keys for signing RPMs (one for OSG, one for the Holland Computing Center at UNL)
   * The database password for Koji
   * Host keys for a variety of OSG-related hosts, including Koji and ITB hosts
   * Access control lists for write access to Subversion
   * An SSH key for logging into the IU backup machine from UW

---++++ 10A. Who are the authorized people who can access this data? How do you determine this list of people?  

| *File(s)* | *Access* |
| RPM signing keys | Accessible by OSG Software staff, CHTC system administrators, CHTC Research Computing Facilitation lead |
| Koji DB password | Accessible by OSG Software staff, CHTC system administrators, CHTC Research Computing Facilitation lead |

| IU SSH key | Accessible by select OSG Software staff, CHTC system administrators, CHTC Research Computing Facilitation lead |

---++++ 10B. Do you inform the authorized people about how they should treat restricted data?  

No, we assume that all people who have access understand their privileges and responsibilities.

---++++ 10C. Which access control mechanisms applies to this data?  

Access to hosts are controlled by ssh, and access to files is controlled by filesystem permissions.

---++++ 10D. Do you keep a log of accesses to the data? 

Probably not. Presumably, there are logs of ssh logins, but probably none on filesystem access.

---++++ 10 E. And if so, how long do you keep the log files?  

Unknown.

---++++ 10F. What information is recorded in the log files?  

Unknown.

---++++ 10G. How do you terminate rights of authorized recipients? Which mechanisms are used to achieve this?  

We rely on system administrators and do not know how they handle this task.

---+++ 11. If you do not own any limited data, skip to Question 12. If you have multiple data under restricted category and each one has different answers for the following questions, please answer the questions for each data separately	 

We have not identified any limited data.

---++++ 11A. Who is authorized to access the data? How do you determine this list of people?
---++++ 11B. How do you communicate the security requirements to the data to authorized recipients ? Do the recipients agree to the requirements? Do you keep record of such communications in a way that can be audited?
