   * No new major vulnerabilities or incidents. Updated openssl packages available for SL.
   * Script to add CILogon CA certs to existing VOMS users with Digicert-grid certs seems to work. Hoping Neha can test on a copy of the fermilab voms. Will create wiki page to document.
   * Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill with Scott.

   * Cert-less user separation ([[http://cd-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=5552][docdb documentation]])
      * Waiting on Mine to decide if requirements document is sufficient to give to Miron
      * No update on the implementation of scenario 2 -- stalled because Brian can't give it attention this month
      * Did not go further with investigating CILogon with !MyProxy.
      * Mine tells me that we can probably depend on everybody having an FNAL services account, and so depend on an ECP and not require the use of !MyProxy.
      * Tried out ecp.pl from [[http://www.cilogon.org/ecp][CILogon]].  It doesn't have an option to save the cookie, but it seems it could because it is in the protocol.  Trying to set up a meeting with Jim Basney.  There are [[https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/Contributions][other clients available]] in bash and python, but they may not be maintained.  I saw one of them keeping cookies in a file in the current directory.
   * KCA replacement
      * If we can just get our IDP to support FERMI.FNAL.GOV in addition to SERVICES.FNAL.GOV with ECP, we could write a drop-in replacement for kx509 using CILogon-BasicCA.  I think we should support both kerberos and services accounts, because for those who use kerberos it is more convenient and for those who don't use kerberos, a services account is more convenient.  The technology is practically identical so it shouldn't be difficult to support both.  Jim Basney said that IdPs have an option to authenticate directly with Kerberos.
   * WLCG
      * Nothing new this week
   * voms-proxy-init problem
      * Found that voms-proxy-init from the voms-clients-2.0.8 on the jobsub servers fifebatch1 & 2 occasionally generates proxies that can become corrupted (causing invalid signature error), if the first 9 bits of the 20-byte serial number is all zeros or all 1s.  Recommended upgrading to voms-clients-cpp-2.0.12.  2.0.11 and older is broken.

   * OSG Security awareness slides: updated.
