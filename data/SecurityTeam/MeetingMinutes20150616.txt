---+ OSG Security Team Meetings

   * Meetings are every week on Tuesdays at 9:45 Chicago time.
   * Phone: 866-740-1260 ID 8406490

   * No new major vulnerabilities or incidents. Updated openssl packages available for SL.
   * Script to add CILogon CA certs to existing VOMS users with Digicert-grid certs seems to work. Hoping Neha can test on a copy of the fermilab voms. Will create wiki page to document.
   * Schedule and conduct an Oasis security drill with Scott.

   * Cert-less user separation ([[http://cd-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=5552][docdb documentation]])
      * Waiting on Mine to decide if requirements document is sufficient to give to Miron
      * No update on the implementation of scenario 2 -- stalled because Brian can't give it attention this month
      * No progress on CILogon demo this week, didn't have time to work on it.  I think I should focus next on learning the shibboleth command line tools (because of next point).
      * Mine tells me that we can probably depend on everybody having an FNAL services account, and so depend on an ECP and not require the use of !MyProxy.
   * KCA replacement
      * If we can just get our IDP to support FERMI.FNAL.GOV in addition to SERVICES.FNAL.GOV with ECP, we could write a drop-in replacement for kx509 using CILogon-BasicCA.  I think we should support both kerberos and services accounts, because for those who use kerberos it is more convenient and for those who don't use kerberos, a services account is more convenient.  The technology is practically identical so it shouldn't be difficult to support both.
   * WLCG
      * Nothing new this week
   * voms-proxy-init problem
      * Found that voms-proxy-init from the voms-clients-2.0.8 on the jobsub servers fifebatch1 & 2 occasionally generates proxies that can become corrupted (causing invalid signature error), if the first 9 bits of the 20-byte serial number is all zeros or all 1s.  Recommended upgrading to voms-clients-cpp-2.0.12
