---++Meeting Minutes 

Doug, Mine, Jim, and Anand. 

*Doug* 
   * In index.txt file, we can have the first column showing the old hash and the next column showing the new hash value. The current CA package will work with the current probes and the fetch crl code granted a site is not running openssl 1.0. What about if we do not put both hashes into the index file, but make the probe more intelligent to calculate and use the correct hash number. This would be useful if we ever need to add a third type of hash into the index file. but we will not likely to have a new hash value. We decide include both values until we completely transition to openssl 1.0. 
   * Doug will get the new index file out today
   * Robot testing is still stalling. the next high priority thing to do. 
   * voms code documentation for web service interaction is missing. This is the part that VOMS interacts with GUMS server. Doug wants to look at this part because this is the part we will work with if we ever use VOMS as an IdP. Mine does not think this part is necessary to look into if the VOMS version from EGEE directly issues SAML credentials.  

*Anand:*
   * Ticket 8517, we get rid of the secmon voms probe. we will instead look at the results from http://myosg.grid.iu.edu/vovomsstatus/index?datasource=vomsstatus&start_type=7daysago&start_date=05%2F11%2F2010&end_type=now&end_date=05%2F11%2F2010&all_vos=on&active=on&active_value=1&sort_key=name
   * Mine does not understand why pinging VOMS servers is OSG's responsibility. Doug thinks this helps with checking if the information we distribute in OSG template is correct or not. We agree that checking the content of VO package is important. But we should not have to actively observe whether a VOMS server is up or down. 
 
    * The CA update probes yum version fluctuates a lot. If one of the yum repositories does not update, the probe gives us an error message. Tom gave a method to Anand to enabling only one repo during yum updates. Once the probe runs and checks the yum results, the yum will later continue with updating the rest of the repos because we want the montiroign machine to be up-top-date. 
   * Jim and Anand both think automated warning emails on probe results are useful. Soichi has sent us a template code. Jim and Anand will look into how to write scripts for other probes.  
   * RSV probe modification is almost complete. the modification is due to the new CA layout. It is just waiting for the new index file. 

*Jim*
   * the documentation deadlines are sent to the team. Iwona sent some comments, which Jim will reply to those. 
   * no incidents.
   * one vulnerability from red-hat kernel.  vague. not critical, and not widely used. no exploit code has been released. nobody in osg uses the ext package. 
   * How our CAs are doing in terms of publishing CA and CRLs on time. Does our results match Nagios monitor of IGTF?  No major issues, most results are pretty close.  

*Igor*
   * nothing to report.
