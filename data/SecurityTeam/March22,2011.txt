---++ Meeting March 22
---+++ Attending
   * Alain, Anand, Dan, Marco, Mine, Suchandra
   * Apologies: Steve
---+++ Minutes
   * Alain will take the instructions page to Scott and ask his opinion.
   * Alain suggested that there needs to be an investigation on what service need to be restarted for the new ca certs to take effect.
      * This will probably be a bit time consuming investigation. No decision on who will do this.
   * Mine will evaluate our fall-back plan. How we can continue to distribute CA certs in the old format with or without IGTF's help
   * Everyone will look at the services tested in ITB and comment on anything missing.
   * Everyone will comment on which software packages (ce, worker node, voms, gums, etc) and which versions should be tested. Do we already have a twiki page for this? If not, can Anand start one please?

We are meeting again next Monday (Mar 28), at 11 am central. Same number.
