   * Security incident at TACC. No OSG involvement other than turning off unused local account for the user.
   * Security vulnerability in JIRA. GOC to do update today I believe.
   * Worked on cvmfs templates for Jose. Jose sent out link to review code. Will try to get more info on how key signing/exchange will work.
   * Will prepare announcement about old-format cert bundles going away. Is Digicert going to publish their new intermediate cert? Could be time for another release. 
   * SL5 !MySQL update coming, involves complicated migration procedure. Tested update. Messy end state. I think this would be a good blog article.
   * Both GOC svn and koji are still using my doegrid certs. Need to ask to get that changed now that the release is done...
   * Will conduct a security drill with Stratum 0.
