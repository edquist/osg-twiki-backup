   * test.cilogon.org is supposed to be ready with new DN, but it is instead failing because of a problem with the 'ou' attribute from both Fermilab IdPs, ECP and Ping.  The problem on at least the ECP IdP is that it is not sending SAML 2.0-compliant "Name"; it should be "urn:oid:2.5.4.11" but it is instead "ou".  The Ping IdP may have the same root problem, but I don't know because I haven't seen a trace.  I made a service-now ticket RITM0315003 for Olga but she isn't in today.
   * Meeting with Olga, Frank, and Al to talk about kx509 packaging rescheduled to Friday.
   * Roughly 80% done with first cigetcert implementation [[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/issues/10923][redmine]] ticket which goes through retrieving a cert.  I gave up on using the standard python 2.6 xml library and switched to the lxml library that the sample python ecp client used.   I thought the code with the standard library was doing everything right, but it was failing a signature check on the ECP IdP for some unknown reason.  lxml adds a minor complication to an EL5 distribution, but EL5 has to have a kerberos library distribution anyway so one more doesn't make much difference.

      * Information being collected in a non privileged fashion 
      * Had some questions on making the information making this information easily accessible, but Brian feels that the risk is not significant since the information is already public
