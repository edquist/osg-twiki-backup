---++Meeting Minutes

Updates on the critical milestones . Mine will upload WBS and new priorities

   * Anand: RSV probes are completely finished. GUMS probes are with Jay. Anand does not know about their fate. Anand's probes are modified to the new rsv format. 

   * Aashish: BNL prefers the May 1st week for test. bnl needs web proxy for sending data out. We should notify the site admin before test on head. Using non-start port may be a solution to get over web proxy issue. this may make our drill more exciting as the site admins have to look for non-standard ports. 

   * Igor: jay and Igor has agreed on the VO templates. can start writing the edg converter. GOC has not heard about the templates., but they should hear and agree to the template. 

   * Doug: DOEgrids contingency planning. 
Doug will list services running by DOEGrids, how frequently used, assess their impact on OSG , ie update the risk grading table. 
CRLs , email, LDAP and notification. 

DOEgrids moved their CRL location. 25% did not move to new url. are we getting RSV failures? 
anyone who is doing vdt-ca-update should get the crl location. 
Doug will do more analysis on this 25% on why they did not get the new location. 

   * Jim: joined InCommon. silver is the goal for IdPs. 

what about security software advisory process. 
we should discuss this more.
