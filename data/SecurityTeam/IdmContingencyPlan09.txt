This document is developed following the guidance in [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-34/sp800-34.pdf][NIST SP-800-34]],
"Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems",
and the contingency planning material developed at
Security.IdMContingencyPlanning.

---++ Introduction
---+++ Purpose
This DOEGrids CA Service Replying Party and Registration Authority Contingency Plan ( *RPRACP* ) establishes procedures to mitigate the impact
to OSG operations following a disruption of DOEGrids CA services.  The DOEGrids CA is an important part of the
larger Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) essential to OSG.  The PKI includes many IGTF accredited CAs
as well as the means of distribution of the trust anchors (CA signing certificates and related files).
The following objectives have been established for this plan:
   * Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan that consists of the following phases:
      * Notification/Activation phase to detect and assess damage and to activate the plan
      * Recovery phase to restore partial PKI operations and perform actions to mitigate the impact while normal operations of the DOEGrids CA is restored by ESnet.
      * Reconstitution phase to restore OSG Relying Party and Registration Authority to normal operations following re-establishment of DOEGrids CA operations by ESnet.
   * Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out Relying Party and Registration Authority processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal operations.
   * Assign responsibilities to designated OSG personnel and provide guidance for recovering OSG Relying Party and Registration Authority during prolonged periods of interruption to normal operations.
   * Ensure coordination with other OSG and ESnet staff who will participate in the contingency planning strategies. Ensure coordination with external points of contact and PKI participants who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.

---+++ Applicability
This OSG Relying Party and Registration Authority Contingency Plan applies to the effects on OSG of outages and service failures of the
DOEGrids Certification Authority ([[http://www.doegrids.org][www.doegrids.org]]) and the [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/ra/][OSG Registration Authority]].
