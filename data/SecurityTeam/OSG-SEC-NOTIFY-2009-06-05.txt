Note that there are now several IP addresses in the 69.128, 69.129, 69.130, 
207.206, 207.224 and 207.225 network blocks. Any connection from these 
locations should be treated as suspicious and verified with the appropriate user(s). 
Note however that at least one connection from 69.129 has been confirmed to be legitimate.

* Update on the rootkit *

In many cases, the attacker gains root access by exploiting known vulnerabilities, 
it is therefore essential to ensure Linux hosts are kept up-to-date with security patches.

Recent kernels should prevent Phalanx (and similar rootkits) to be injected via 
/dev/mem modifications (both RHEL 4 and RHEL5 have released kernels to implement this). 
Beware however that a new version "2.4a" of the Phalanx rootkit has been seen in the wild, 
which first tries to inject the malware via /dev/mem, but in case it does not succeed, 
it tries to load the malware as a standard Linux Kernel Module (LKM).

As per the last updates, while the attacker has mostly been concentrating on SSH keys, 
it seems that standard passwords are being sniffed and reused also.

It has also been discovered that connections to the backdoor can produce the following 
syslog message (usually in /var/log/secure, /var/log/message):

---------------8<------------------
sshd[XXXX]: Disconnecting: Bad packet length 1883783500.
---------------8<------------------
(where XXXX is the PID of sshd)


For phalanx < 2.4a:
Although the rootkit hides in different locations (ex: /usr/lib/heahu.p2/, /usr/lib/huuuh.p2, 
/usr/lib/zupzz.p2, etc.), the backdoor does not support some characters and should 
segfault using this command:

(echo SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_3.8.1p1; sleep 1; echo 'pHALANX2!'kill_phalanx2'+++++++++++++++'| cut -c 1-31; sleep 1; echo 'test'; cat)|nc <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> 22

(<POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> is the hostname that is checked for signs of the rootkit)

The resulting syslog message on <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> would look like:
<DATE> <POSSIBLY_INFECTED_HOSTNAME> kernel: <malicious_kernel_thread>:
segfault at 0000000000000000 rip 0000000000418900 rsp 0000007fbfff8698 error 4

Once the host has been probed, the existence of such a syslog message is a very strong indication 
it has been infected by the rootkit. Note that this test does not work with Phalanx 2.4a, which is also 
implementing randomized paths.

However, for all versions for the rootkit, it is possible that a malicious cron job has been 
configured to inject the rootkit, which would leave entries in syslog. Ex:

"/usr/share/FKIPzLXRAvaL.p2/.p-2.4ai & > /dev/null"

OSG Security Contacts,

Note that the primary identifier for this ongoing incident has
changed from CERNCERT-20080805 to GRID-SEC-001 with this notice.

The OSG Security Team wants you to be aware of new information regarding
ongoing attacks via ssh credential stealing. Please note that these
attacks are different from regular bruteforce ssh attempts you see
on daily basis.  In these incidents, miscreants are stealing users
credentials and attempt local root escalation exploits to obtain root
within your network.

Above information is complied by cumulative efforts of multiple sites who
have been monitoring this activity.

Any login from the IP address in this report should be considered malicious
and be reported to security team. We can further help you to determine if
your site indeed has a problem.
