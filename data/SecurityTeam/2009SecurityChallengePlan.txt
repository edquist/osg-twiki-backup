---+ 2009 Security Challenge Plan

---++ Timeline

   * January and February:
      * Challenge of EGEE sites
      * OSG preparations
   * March:
      * OSG All Hands Meeting: Final preparations, announcements, etc.
      * Then: Challenge of OSG sites

---++ EGEE Contacts

   * Sven Gabriel <sveng@nikhef.nl> - EGEE OCST Security Challenge Coordinator
   * Romain Wartel <Romain.Wartel@cern.ch> - EGEE Security Officer

---++ EGEE OSCT Procedure

   * The test operator (TOP) warns the registered CSIRT contact of the site about the upcoming challenge
   * The TOP submits a job to the site using an identity part of a random, assisting, SSC-aware VO
   * The TOP informs the site CSIRT contact point that this identity should be treated as malicious and the normal incident response procedure should be followed (with some caveats)
   * The TOP measures the quality of the response of the site based on an existing set of criteria
   * The site is informed of its score

---++ Lessons from 2008 Challenge

   * Sites are confused about which procedures (OSG/EGEE/WLCG) they should follow. OSG sites should contact OSG security team which contacts EGEE OSCT.
   * USCMS was challenged as a WLCG Tier1 site. USCMS was registered with both EGEE and OSG. We decided it should de-register from EGEE. Did it?

---++ Questions and Concerns

   * Will EGEE OCST challenge OSG sites or will the OSG Security Team perform the challenge? OSG sites are trained to contact OSG security team (security@opensciencegrid.org), not EGEE OSCT.
   * Do we challenge only WLCG sites in OSG or all OSG sites?

<verbatim>
Concerns to discuss:
1) OSG sites may not respond to EGEE provided email address since those are not part of our standard incident response plan. 
2) Is there a standard response report format ? 
3) How do they (EGEE - Security Challenge Team ) envision OSG security team's role in the challenge ? Especially since OSG sites probably will not respond to EGEE queries and will have to go via us. 

Other questions specific to operating the challenge: 

0) What do they need from us to help them prepare for challenge ? 
	- creation of user accounts ? 
	- issuing certificates/credentials ? 
1) Their notification process 
	- how do they notify sites about incoming challenge ( if at all ). 
	- how do they notify sites about on-going challenge ? ( or do we do this ? Since sites don't know EGEE) 
	- how do they convey to sites about the details specific to the challenge ( like reporting to challenge email address etc ) 

2) What all information would they provide in their notification ? 

3) What kind of data/results they expect from sites ?  
	- entire logs / relevant logs ? 
	- different types of logs 

4) How do they rate sites 
	- whats their scoring criteria ?
	- in other words, what points do they rate sites on ? 
	- Is there a set of software/scripts which they use to parse through site response / 

5) What all do they do in the challenge ? 
	- is the scope limited to illegal job submission or other aspects involved ?
	- do they do any other thing - download exploits, test vulnerability of kernels ? 
	- do they target any other hosts or only the clusters ? Admins, their accounts ? 

6) How do they define the end of challenge ? 
	- what all sites need to do to be able to say challenge is finished ?
