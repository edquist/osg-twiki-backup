---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * The NERSC CA is expired in the current production bundle. But the new bundle that is been in testing has the fresh certs. We must send the updated bundle to sites
   * The CILogon Basic CA is set to be rolled out to FermiGrid production. We will ask CMS Tier1 about their production release schedule. 
   * The IGTF occasionally removes CA certs. The CRL files on disk is left behind. Fetch-crl does not fix the problem because it does not take care of the orphaned CRL files. Kevin will create a solution. 
   * Central Banning Tool. Have a meeting with Tim and Brian
   * Give Kevin all the documentation form the traceability project. 
   * SHA-2 transition. No meetings yet. 

*Anand*

   * cannot make the meeting
