   * Working with Garhan to complete some more tests for Condor-CE security drill.
   * Time to remove HIAST CA again?
   * Make sure Incidents were up to date in the Wiki. Is it safe to just say "see ticket?" Inquired with GOC about how long old tickets will be available. Tickets should be available forever by number. Jira ticket opened to add option to search for security tickets.
   * Update OSG risk assessment matrix.

---++ Anand
   * Released IGTF CA 1.61 and osg-ca-certs 1.43. Should be released to production today.
   * AUP follow up - waiting for DZero and LBNE.
