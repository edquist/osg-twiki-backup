---++Meeting Notes

*Kevin*
   * Working on the PKI documentation. Took over the leftover work from Anand. 
   * Java vulnerability. No response regarding rmi usage. Not very worried about this vulnerability. 
   * gsi-ssh patch is approved for release. GOC did not respond to the ticket on gsi-ssh vulnerability. 
   * CVMFS and Oasis risk assessment successfully completed and accepted by Fermilab. 
   * Grid proxy lifetime discussion. VOMS accept the grid proxies to generate a voms proxy. Plain grid proxy lifetimes can be enforced by the new lcmaps plugin. we will ask Dave Dykstra to test the plugin. if it works, we will notify our sites to start using the new plugin to enforce proxy lifetimes. 
   * Cilogon risk assessment first draft is completed. Kevin will talk to HCC whether CIlogon Basic CA certs is sufficient. Mine will push on Glow whether they want to pursue this path. 

*Anand*
   * On vacation
   * Traceability risk assessment first draft is completed.
