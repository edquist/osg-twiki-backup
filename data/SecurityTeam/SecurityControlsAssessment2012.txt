---+ Security Controls Assessment 2012
---+ 2.2 Management Controls
---++ 2.2.1 Integrated Computer Security Management
---+++ 2.2.1.1 Roles and Responsibilities – Line Organization
   * The security plan still specifies a 6 month review schedule. Is this still going to be increased to 1 year?
   * The OSG Management Plan doc has not been updated since last summer, still shows Ruth Pordes as Executive Director.
   * The link for osg management organization pointing here: https://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Learn_About_Us/OSG_Organization, is not valid.
   * There does not seem to be an Org Chart, at least not one showing individual names, is this required by this control?

---+++ 2.2.1.2 Awareness for OSG Managers
   * Awareness materials containing necessary information for OSG Managers: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=573][OSG Document 573]] provides relevant information.
   * Document needs minor updating.
   * Should the Security Plan specify where the awareness materials are?

---+++ 2.2.1.3 Accountability of Sites, Users, and VO’s
   * Does the OSG have the ability to bar a user, a VO, or a site? _Answers from Rob Quick, Operations Coordinator_
      * Users - The CA can revoke a certificate for a users thus barring him from using the cert. The VO can remove him from VOMS effectively barring him from using OSG. Neither of these are OSG actions, the most we can do is ask the RA or VO to do this.
      * VOs - We can remove them from the VO Package, stop publishing their VO information, and ask sites and GUMS admins to remove them also. This is not a quick process, but after they are removed at the site/GUMS they will no longer be able to use OSG resources. This is not a single operation and dependent more on the sites taking action than OSG.
      * Sites - We can stop publishing their information in GOC services, making them invisible to most automated discovery methods. This would leave them functional but not easy to find. We could also revoke host/service certs (only if the use DOEGrids Certs). This would effectively stop operation, at least until they obtained other IGTF credentials. Removing sites from the !GlideIn Factory would stop jobs from this submission mechanism, but not all jobs. 
   * Where are the awareness materials? add reference to security plan? (AUP)

---++ 2.2.2. Security Processes
---+++ 2.2.2.1 Computer Security Lifecycle Meeting
   * Weekly meeting minutes can be found at MeetingMinutes2012
---+++ 2.2.2.2 Briefing of the Area Coordinators
   * Meeting minutes can be found at Management.AreaCoordinator
---+++ 2.2.2.3 Risk Assessment
   * List of contact persons should be updated.
   * Introduction may need updating to reflect current users/experiments.
   * Should mention of Digicert be added?
---+++ 2.2.2.4 Policies, Plans, and Procedures
   * An up-to-date list can be found at Documentation.PoliciesProcedures
      * Should these still be referring to JSPG docs?
      * Grip AUP: OK
      * Service Agreement: Bad link to Incident Response Plan.
      * Privacy Policy: OK
      * Certificate Authority Policy: OK
      * DOEGrids Certificate Policy and Certification Practice Statement: off site document. Need clarification on CRL updates.
      * Site/VO Removal: OK. This doc is in twiki, whereas the others are in docdb. Since twiki has approvals and revision control, should all docs be moved from docdb to twiki?
      * SoftwareVulnerabilityHandling: Clarification on when ET needs to be notified? If software folks notify sec. team directly, does email still need to be sent to security@osg as part of the handling process?
      * SecurityAnnouncements: Still requires ET approval on announcements, should this be removed or marked only critical announcements?
      * Joining/removing security team members.
---+++ 2.2.2.5 Self Assessment
