---++Meeting Minutes

Jim: 
   * Quiet week. Nothing in OSG/EGI/TG. Oak Ridge incident is determined to have no effect on TG. 
   * Sent the EGI drill email to John Hover and Doug Benjamin. What we need to do here at our end? What are the requirements from the WLCG mgmt board to participate? Jim will find these out. Jim thinks that coordination would be OK within a month. What items will get dropped due to the incident drill? Jim will look at the effort spreadsheet. Mine will post the latest spreadhseet. 
   * Alain said the osg-security-softw-vulnerability list is for distributing the software vulnerabilities to software providers. Alain is not using the list. Alain directly emails the software contacts. Mine owns the email list and if she gets the contact information from Alain she can add software providers to this list. needs to get the software contacts emails lists. GOC already added an option for emailing the software contacts while making anouncements.
   * dcache vulnerability is closed. Alain has the responsibility to put the fixed software into VDT. Jim will clarify with Alain that if this is also his understanding as well. 
   * GOC after hours reporting problems. Jim will ask Rob if they have worked with their after hour people. 
   * Ask Goc to include next-steps in the email confirmation that should be sent after an incident is reported. 
   * Tier 3 support. Marco said he will notify Jim when he needed a security team member on the call. 

Marco 
   * Atlas is having the firefox renegotiation problem. The solution is already described in the ticket. The server side can fix the problem. Marko will figure out what the server needs to do. Mine will communicate to DOEgrids. 
   * Have to put in the screen shots. have to write up steps for getting certificates and request VOMRS registration. End of May is the target date.  
   * Marko will coordinate with Robert Engel where to put this documentation.  

Anand 
   * is India due to death in the family.

Alain Deximo
   * Good week. 3 lingering certificates. Only atlas users. Ernst and Hover has been emailed as usual. 
   * Geant VO problem is solved. We decided to use GPN VO Agent. The certificate requests from Geant is rare enough not to warrant a new Agent
   * The issue of having back up RA is almost solved. Dhiva wanted Kyle and Elizabeth to send separate RA requests to the PMA. Dhiva said Alain can approve these requests. Once it is done, Kyle and Elizabeth will act as back up RAs.
   * Alain started another doodle poll for having a general meeting with RA Agents. We have not had any responses for the doodle poll yet.  If we cannot get many people to participate, we will cancel the meeting and proceed with random audits. We decide to hold meetings after performing the audits. This way we can point to mistakes/etc. We will wait one more week if we can raise interest from Agents. Alain also says that he does not have any major problems with any Agents. When he has problems, he directly contacts the Agents. Alain's impression is most Agents seem to be doing fine. Therefore, we may just skip the meeting and jump into random audit of already-issued certificates.
