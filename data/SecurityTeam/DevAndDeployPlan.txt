   4 Create the capability in OIM to request certificates from DigiCert CA as well CILogon HSM
      a Owner: Altunay, Hayashi
      b Dates: 3/13-4/2
      c Create a simple “switch” functionality that determines which backend CA is called for a request. The OIM staff will be able to set the switch per each VO. The switch will not be visible to end users at all. 

---+++Updates to Schedule Tasks
   1 Document an initial SLA
      OSG and XSEDE teams agreed over the service level expectations and Scott Teige will draft the first version of the SLA by March 9
   3 Integrate the OIM Backend with CIlogon 
   4 Create the capability in OIM to request certs from DigiCert and CIlogon HSM based on OIM configuration. 
      Both tasks, integrating the OIM with CIlogon and creating the switch, has been completed by Soichi and ready for testing. March6, 2015. MIS VO is the first VO to be configured to request certs form CIlogon HSM. 

---+++Questions to Ponder
   1 is switching users based on their VOs  asufficient way to handle this transition? Would we ever have an attribute different from VO name to switch users?
