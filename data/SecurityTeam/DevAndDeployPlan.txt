---++Development Plan

Owners: Altunay, Quick, Hayashi

Period: 2/27/15-4/2/15 

---+++Scheduled Tasks

   1 Document an initial SLA with XSEDE
      * Owner: Teige, Hayashi, Basney
      * Dates: 2/27-3/3
   2 Freeze the CILogon HSM API as seen by OSG
      * Owner: Basney
      * Dates: 3/4-3/5
   3 Integrate the OIM Backend with CILogon HSM API calls
      * Owner: Hayashi
      * Dates: 3/6-3/12
   4 Create the capability in OIM to request certificates from DigiCert CA as well CILogon HSM
      * Owner: Altunay, Hayashi
      * Dates: 3/13-4/2
      * Create a simple “switch” functionality that determines which backend CA is called for a request. The OIM staff will be able to set the switch per each VO. The switch will not be visible to end users at all. 
   5 Allow GOC staff / (&GA/RAs) to reset FAILED requests - so that user doesn't have to resubmit a new request after recovering from CA issue. 
      * Hayashi
      * Dates: 3/13-4/10
   6  Update current request issue form to be similar to a "wizard form". This allows user to know which steps they are in while certificate is vetted / issued, etc.. Also, this prevent users from leaving the form prematurely without downloading issued certificate in pkcs12 format (Jira OSGPKI-394)
      * Hayashi
      * Dates: 3/13-4/10
   7  Request from CILogon HSM to improve error handling / recovering mechanism. Currently, if Digicert fails to issue certificate on the first try, the request will be placed under FAILED status. We should use GOC's AMQP server to queue certificate issue request, and re-queue in case of failure and do certificate issuing asynchronously. This will become more important with cilogon HSM if it will have a lesser quality SLA than Digicert.
      * This request has been rejected by CILogon Team
   8 Request from CIlogon HSM to report meaningful error message (due to "security reasons") in case of certificate issue failure - especially for user certificate. More descriptive error messages - at least to indicate that the error is transient (server issue), or permanent (bad DN, missing fields, etc..)
      * Owner: Jim Basney
      * Dates: 3/13-4/10



---+++Updates to Schedule Tasks
   1 Document an initial SLA
      OSG and XSEDE teams agreed over the service level expectations and Scott Teige will draft the first version of the SLA by March 9
   3 Integrate the OIM Backend with CILogon 
      * Completed by Soichi and ready for testing. March6, 2015.
   4 Create the capability in OIM to request certs from DigiCert and CIlogon HSM based on OIM configuration. 
      * Completed by Soichi and ready for testing. March6, 2015. MIS VO is the first VO to be configured to request certs form CIlogon HSM. 
   5 The Item #7 above has been rejected by CIlogon Team citing  lack of effort. 


---+++Items discovered during the Dev Phase 
   1 The documentation on osg-user-cert-renew seems to be broken. It says " User needs to provide VO name if the requested hostname has multiple VO's assigned". This command line tool never requests host certificates. Moreover, the parameters that osg-user-cert-renewis asking does not quite match up with the parameters that OIM's user_cert_renew API receives. Must ask OSg software team about this. 
   2 The documentation for osg-gridadmin-cert-request is broken. It requires VO name as an input. 
---+++Interesting Notes and Questions
   1 is switching users based on their VOs  asufficient way to handle this transition? Would we ever have an attribute different from VO name to switch users?
