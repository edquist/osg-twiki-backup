---++ Standing Items 
   * Issue reported at https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/33278 concerning credential caching on HT-condor CE which leads to delayed effect on GUMS banning.
      * Jeny- This is a HT-condor CE issue not GUMS
      * Jeny to ask for general recommendation 
   * COmanage
      * Has bugs and may not be stable enough
      * Susan- How quickly are they fixing the bugs?
   * CVMFS Yubikey
      * Dave- Yubikey comes with a PIN, PUK, and Management key -- can we leave them default?
      * Susan- More interested to change the default Management key in Yubikey in case someone breaks into the machine, so they can't make the key unusable.
      * Dave- The GOC can store the management key in a file on the same flash drives where they have the current OSG cvmfs masterkey, which will become only backups
