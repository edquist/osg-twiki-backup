---+ Security Control Assessment 2010

---++Management Controls
---+++ Roles and Responsibilities – Line Organization
   * Security Plan Section: 2.2.1.1
   * REPORT: Seek permission to change control frequency from 6 months to a year. Mine Altunay is found to be Education VO Manager in OIM records. Find out if this is on purpose as she does not play a role in managing this VO.  Change has been made to the Security Plan that Security Officer is listed as security contact for OSG VO rather than OSG Executive Director. this change reflects the current recording in OIM. 
---+++ Awareness for OSG Managers
   * Security Plan Section: 2.2.1.2 
   * Awareness materials containing necessary information for OSG Managers: [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=573][OSG Document 573]] provides relevant information. 
   * REPORT: The awareness material needs minor updating. It is a very broad document that covers above and beyond awareness materials (60+ slides). It needs to be shorten before presented to area leads. A regular venue such as OSG AHM can be used to present the awareness materials to the area leads periodically. The control can be updated to also check how frequently the awareness training is given.   
---+++ Accountability of Sites, Users, and VO’s
   * Security Plan Section: 2.3.1.3 
   * Banning Users: OSG software stack provides the sites with two mechanisms to get the list of users from VO (GUMS, edg-mkgridmap). Both these mechanisms provide capabilities to ban user at the site. Technical information on how to conduct this banning may be found on [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/BanningUsersAtSite][twiki]]. Furthermore we maintain VO security contacts on OSG Information Management System (OIM) (validated yearly) who could be contacted and be asked to remove the offending user from their VOMS.
   * Banning VO: OSG distributes the names of the VOs and the location of the VOMS servers as a template that is used by both GUMS and edg-mkgridmap at the site. If we need to ban a VO OSG is capable of quickly publishing a new template file with the offending VO removed. The sites could then easily update the GUMS/edg-mkgridmap configuration to use the new template. Furthermore the VO will be removed from OIM.
   * Banning Sites: We can drop from OIM. MyOSG, BDII, ReSS, ticketing system get their site lists from OIM. 
   * Awareness materials with responsibilities for accountability: VO and sites see and agree to AUP and the service agreement. 
We have Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) documents for [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][Users]], [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=742][VOs]], and [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=87][service level agreement]]. We also provide template for Site and VOs to outline their own policy for users.

   * Tested [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/CreatingCADistributions][Creating CA Distributions]] procedure
   * REPORT
      * The Incident Response Process should be updated to clarify where incident reports are kept. The current process refers to twiki. However, security team keeps some reports as filed in the footprints ticketing system.  
      * The OSG Registration Process has a sub-process on issuing service certificates. This sub-process should be updated. 
      * Secure Email key Management. A separate but related process is needed. The new process should explain where and how the security team decided on a new shared PGP key for the team. It should also state where this new key is published. 
      * Software Vulnerability Handling Process should be reviewed by security and VDT teams jointly. The VDT team should confirm that they can perform the steps assigned to them. If not, the process should be updated. 
      * The Executive Director approved the above policies and findings on 5/13/2011
   
---+++ Self Assessment 2.2.2.5
   * Previous self assessment from Mine can be found [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Security/ControlsAssessment2007/Altunay_self_assessment.doc][here]].
   * TODO: Get updated document from Mine
---+++ Peer Review 2.2.2.6
   * Executive director will conduct a peer review in the Fall 2011.  
---++ Trust Relationships 2.2.3
---+++ Approval 2.2.3.1
   * To add a new person as a contact to an existing resource, the resource owner must approve the addition. The resources have to have a support center. Rob checks and confirm with the resource support center for relationship with OSG. 
   * VO is OK. 
   * A user has to have an existing contact to add themselves. 
   * If there is only one contact,  they cannot remove themselves without providing an additional name. 
   * All the confirmations on the registration of VO and SC and resources are kept on the tickets. 

---+++Documentation 2.2.3.2
   * Merged with section 2.2.3.4 (Review)
---+++ Clear Roles and Responsibilities 2.2.3.3
   * Contacts for the various roles are found in OIM.
   * The security team ask the security contacts to verify their information every yearControlsAssessment2010.
   * Updated the  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Operations/OIMRegistrationInstructions][OSG Registration/OIM Instruction]] page to clearly document the roles and responsibilities of the following contacts: VO Manager, VO Admin, VO Security, Resource Admin, Resource Security, Resource Report. 
---+++ Review
   * Merged with section 2.3.3.2 (Document)
   * OIM entries were examined and appear appropriate. 
   * OSG Executive Director reviewed all the trust relationships in OIM on 5/13/2011. Some contacts and VO memberships have been found to be out of date. A GOC ticket has been opened to correct these.  
---++ Operational Controls
---+++ Security Training and Awareness
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/SecurityAwarenessForTheOSG][Security Awareness for OSG]] 
---++++ Role-based training
   * Major roles and responsibility for each area coordinator are highlighted at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AreaCoordinatorsSecurityTraining]].
   * Invited the area coordinators for a training session.
      * Alain Roy was invited and attended a OSG security call to review and discuss the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AreaCoordinatorsSecurityTraining#Software_Coordinator][security roles and responsibility laid out for software coordinator]]. 
         * Section in the document has been updated based on discussion.
         * The list of services the VDT maintains that might be subject to security control can be found at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/VDTServicesSecurityControl]]
      * Operation Coordinator Rob Quick was invited and his proxy Scott Teige attended a a OSG security meeting to review and discuss the [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AreaCoordinatorsSecurityTraining#Operations_Coordinator][security roles and responsibility laid out for operations coordinator]]. 
         * Section in the document has been updated based on discussion.
   * REPORT: 
      * Ask permission to change the frequency of this control from 6 months to a year. 
      * Discuss whether it is needed to provide training for area leads other than software and operations. Production area lead should also be covered in this training. 
---++++ Regular OSG Core Security Phone Conference
   * Done. Weekly meetings happen every Tuesday and minutes are recorded in security working area.
---++++ OSG and Other Security Mailing Lists
   * Examined.
---++++ Security Briefings and Discussions at Consortium Meetings 
   * The security team held two sessions at the OSG All-Hands meeting in 2011. The second session included a security questionnaire that had previously sent to resource security contacts and discussions on their needs. http://ahm.sbgrid.org/. The security team is also invited to the Council meeting on April 12, 2012. https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Council/April-12-2011 

---+++ Incident Response
---++++Incident Planning
   * OSG has following documents related to incident response:
      * Incident Handling and Response Guide [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=19][doc-db#19]] 
      * Incident Response Process is documented on the twiki at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/IncidentResponseProcess]].
      * Incident Response Policy [[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=875][doc-db#875]]
   * REPORT
      * Incident Response Policy is reviewed and found to be complete and accurate. It lacks Executive Team's signature. This policy is in pending status. Once decided to be approved, this policy may be linked to OSG AUP and Service Agreement Plans. This policy is a summary of the Incident Response Guide which already has been linked at Service Agreement Document. 
      * Incident Handling and Response Guide is reviewed. The guide should be updated. Following issues are noted during the examination. The definition of incident is broader than the definition agreed upon at last JSPG meeting as stated in [[http://www.jspg.org/wiki/Security_Incident_Response_Policy][JSPG Incident Response Policy]]. This is not a critical problem, but it should be corrected at next update of the Guide. The Guide asks "Grid participants MUST respond to incidents involving locally managed or operated resources, services, or identities." The Guide should clarify that this request only covers resources that may affect other grid resources. Otherwise this guide attempts to mandate policies over local resources. The Guide describes the incident response process. OSG has a separate response process described in the twiki. The process included in the Guide does not match accurately the process on the twiki. The Guide can eliminate including the process and refer to the separate process document. Section 6.5.1 in the Guide seems irrelevant.  
      * The Incident Response Process should be updated to clarify where incident reports are kept. The current process refers to twiki. However, security team keeps some reports as filed in the footprints ticketing system. 
      * All of the above policies, plans and procedures are also examined as part of the control 2.2.2.4 Policies, Procedures, and Plans. This control is redundant. However, given incident response is such a crucial part of operational security, this redundancy is useful and should not be eliminated.  

---++++Incident Discovery and Mandatory Reporting
   * GOC monitors security@opensciencegrid.org and triages incident reports and forwards security incidents to the OSG security team. The security team tested the mailing list reporting capabilities on 3/22 with a test incident report. 
   * Security drills were conducted by OSG on uscms and usatlas tier 2 sites that measure how site security contacts followed the incident discovery process.
   * Every year a presentation from the security team at OSG All Hands Meeting covers the incident reporting process http://ahm.sbgrid.org/ 
   * At OSG AHM 2011 the security team provided a survey that measures security contacts' familiarity with incident response process. The surveys are located at https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/AllHandsMeeting2011SecuritySurveys  


---++++Invocation of the Incident Response Plan
   * The documents describing the procedures, identifying contacts, communication strategies are recorded on the twiki at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityTeamWorkingArea#Incident_Response_Procedures]] and were examined.
   * The security team generated a test incident for this control. A test incident where a mock user reports a security incident after business hours is generated. Test is meant to measure a) how GOC determines a report is indeed a security incident and b) how GOC follows the incident invocation process. The test was conducted on 3/22 and the results were discussed internally. GOC has been informed of the issues observed in the invocation process
   * REPORT
      * The control failed. GOC responders did not notice the report and did not notify the security team. A more detailed report on why the process at GOC failed is needed from Operations Lead. After GOC addresses these issues, another test incident should be generated. 
      * There is no formal documentation at GOC to operators to decide which reports are incidents. The verbal communication with GOC operations lead indicates that GOC has a very low threshold for declaring a report as incident and reporting to the security team. The GOC responders only eliminate reports that obviously not reporting an incident such as spam, email addressed incorrectly, etc. However, having a written document may be useful for future. 
      * The control asks to initiate a test incident against the sites and measure site security contacts' responses. This control has been measured in 2008 and 2009 [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/2009Tier2SecurityDrillInstrSites][site drills]]. Another drill in 2011 should be planned and executed. The drill should measure VO and GOC's security readiness since sites have been covered in previous drills. 
      
---++++Incident Handling
   * This control should be covered under a security drill. 
   * REPORT
      * The last two security drills have been conducted in 2008 and 2009. A new drill should be executed as soon as possible. EGI/WLCG security teams plan for a new security drill against Atlas sites. OSG should either participate or later conduct a similar drill on its own. Under the drill, site and VOs capabilities to perform incident handling including having the necessary raw material will be tested. 
 
---++++Incident Analysis and Reporting
   * Though we have not had a serious security incident in OSG incident reports and notifications sent to OSG security contacts from this and earlier years have been recorded on the OSG twiki at [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Security/SecurityTeamWorkingArea#Incident_Response_Reports]]
   * REPORT
      * This control should be updated. The control is not specific enough in explaining how incident analysis and reports should be examined.  
---+++Data Integrity 2.3.3
   * OSG Executive Director confirmed that no services in OSG handles sensitive personal information. We only identified docdb, mailing list, and OSG RA service handling limited or restricted data. A questionnaire covering the controls in 2.3.3.2, 2.3.3.3, 2.3.3.4 had been sent to the above three services on 5/17/2011.  

   * The remaining OSG core services only handles public data. A short questionnaire asking these services to confirm whether they continue to only handle public data is sent on 5/17/2011. The details on the [[DataControls2011][survey results]] are published. The services that received the questionnaire are: Gratia/ReSS, OSG website, OSG EDU VO, Engage VO, Engage VO FrontEnd, OSG VO, OSG  GlideinWMS FrontEnd, GlideinPilot Factory, Monitoring and Measurements website, GIP, and Engage Sharepoint and Matchmaking services. The reamining services belong to OSG GOC and VDT teams. GOC will be visited on Jun 1, 2011. The results of these questionnaire will be published at  web site.
