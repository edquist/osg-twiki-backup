---+ VDT 1.10.1r glexec update

[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/releases/1.10.1/release-r.html][VDT 10.10.1r]]
contains a security update to 
[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/components/glexec.html][glexec]].
This page includes additional information about the security issue.

An incorrect configuration can allow authenticated users on the system
to become any other user except root.

Due to this configuration change, Glexec will no longer work on
Rhel5/ia32 platforms. The developers of Glexec are working to fix
support for this platform in a future version of Glexec.

We see the risk of exploitation as medium to low. In the case of
suspicion, glexec provides enough logging information to keep track of
who changed id without authorization. Sites who want to continue
production on SL5 can do so under this risk. We do not see an imminent
threat.

For details about glexec logging, see:
http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGlexecInstall#About_the_gLexec_log_files

---++ Manual update

If you would like to fix the Glexec configuration without doing an
update:

<p>Edit the file at <code>/etc/glexec/lcmaps/lcmaps-suexec.db</code>

<p>The file's contents should be replaced by the following, with necessary substitutions made:

<pre>path = <em>VDT_LOCATION</em>/glexec-osg/<em>LIB_DIR</em>/modules

good = "lcmaps_dummy_good.mod"
bad = "lcmaps_dummy_bad.mod"

gums = "lcmaps_gums.mod -exec <em>VDT_LOCATION</em>/glexec-osg/contrib/gums_interface/getmapping"

verifyproxy = "lcmaps_verify_proxy.mod"
    "--allow-limited-proxy"
    " -certdir <em>VDT_LOCATION</em>/globus/TRUSTED_CA"

glexec_get_account:
verifyproxy -> gums

</pre>

Substitutions:
   * VDT_LOCATION -> The root location of your VDT install
   * LIB_DIR -> This should be <code>lib</code> for 32-bit installations and <code>lib64</code> for 64-bit installations.

Follow the
<a href="http://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Trash/ReleaseDocumentationGlexecInstall#Testing_gLexec">
instructions for testing glexec</a> to verify it still works correctly.
