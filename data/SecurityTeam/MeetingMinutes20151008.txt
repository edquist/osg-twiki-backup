   * Olga has finalized and updated the !InCommon metadata to include the ECP test (and future production) servers.  The name is "Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory" throughout so the /O= will be different than the Fermilab in KCA certs.  Jim Basney will be going ahead with the changes to add the /OU= and optionally some /CN= after that for robot certs, and to change the added unique number with the first and last name to instead have /CN=UID:<uid>.
   * Did some major revising on the CISR paper, working on my final adjustments
   * The oasis CRLs are being updated every 6 hours, but grid.cern.ch CRLs are now updated every 3 hours.  Should we change to match?
   * Out at CERN next week
