Meeting with Alain Deximo on 4/1/2011

   * SuraGrid meeting went well. GOC wll act as the Agent for the SURAGrid VO for now. Alain will contact Anand to put their sponsor names into the cert request page. 
   * We had no agent request and a single gridadmin request. 
   * Most problems are GridAdmins and Agents not knowing how to send signed email requests. 
   * Another concern is we do not have any responses from William Baltz. Alain will first ask William if there is a problem. then we will ask HOver and Ernst if we should stop emailing William as this does not seem to be very productive. On a general note, most agent's responses are not detailed enough to understand how/if they are following the Agent processes.  
   * Mine tells Alain to cc sponsor and the requestors on the email correspondence Alain sends to the Agents. 
   * Alain will setup a meeting with selected RA Agents next week to go over the Agent processes. Mine presented this action item to the mgmt and put a deadline of April 14th. 
   * We have a due date to finish training back up person for RA duties at GOC. Alain will ask Rob how he will proceed. Mine's idea is to swap roles for a week and ask a new GOC member to act as the RA for a week. Mine presented this action item to the mgmt and put a deadline of April 14th. 
   * Alain checked with Doug and learned that there is no written process for GridAdmins because all of the activities of the GridAdmis are captured in the RA service instance.
