<b>Risk Assessment</b> - no additional discussion.

<b>Dave Kelsy - EGEE-OSG policy commonalities and divergences</b><br>
The Joint Security Policy Group (JSPG) started at EGEE-LCG and now joint means EGEE-OSG-WLCG.<br>
Goal for common policies for
   * User AUP
   * Site AUP
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo AUP
   * Operational procedures & other policies
   * Write documents independent of any particular grid
Grid policies do not override local policies

Q: Does VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo AUP make any stipulation on VOs about their software?<br>
A: No but it is a good thing for us to work on.

Things we have in common now:
   * Grid AUP
   * security incident response
   * CA approval (has EGEE approval, does it have OSG approval?)

Divergences
   * EGEE assumes sites already have appropriate policies
      * (Editorial note: Doesn't OSG assume that sites have appropriate policies?)
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo AUP
      * Will VOs accept responsibility for users?
      * VOs are not legal entities
      * Are VOs capable of operations & risk analysis?
   * Data privacy legal issues?
We do need to work jointly on these

JSPG is working on new top-level document policy
   * Can we have common version with OSG & EGEE

DP, DK - We need a document describing policy requirements on running services (OSG has a Services AUP)

DS &#8211; There are some parallels between business partnerships between VOs and it may be worth considering what has been learned about business partnerships.

<b>Dane Skow &#8211; !TeraGrid</b><br>
!TeraGrid Overview 
   * Peer review allocations process for NSF researchers
   * Growth area in connecting to campus infrastructures
Security
   * identity based with affiliation to a project, 
   * Central user registry
   * Access via - X509, direct login, user portal/web gateway
   * Working to use X509 as the universal identifier
   * Incident response team meets weekly (useful social & technical function)
      * TG has about 2 incidents/quarter
Participating in GIN - Grid Interoperation Now in GGF (X509 + VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes)<br>
Looking at shibbolith (gridshib.globus.org/tg-paper.html)<br>
Will try at Purdue as test for TG<br>
(Penn State, UChicago & Purdue use shib for campus infrastructure !AuthZ, for exchange/access of resources between institutions)

_discussion_ <br>
Q: What about VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo name space, conflicts?<br>
A: TG agrees to use general VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo namespace plan (DNS-like)<br>

Q: Can CMS VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS attributes be spoofed?<br>
A: IF &#8211; we checked once and decided no<br>
Q: But isn&#8217;t attribute signed by voms cert & checked? (no definitive answer)

On TG people login to portals/gateways with their personal ID, then submit jobs with a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo ID.

Q: How to deal with export controls? <br>
A: Just starting to talk about it, no final solution yet.

<b>Brian Tierney -  Security for Open Science CET</b><br>
Proposal approved in base program and starts Oct. 1

Summary of work (slide 5)<br>
   * Auditing and forensics 
      * Services to enable sites, communities, and application scientists to determine precisely who did what, where and when. 
   * Dynamic ports in firewalls 
      * Services to open and close ports dynamically for applications while enforcing site policy. 
   * Identity management 
      * Services to seamlessly manage identity and access control across sites and collaborations, and to allow for rapid response to security incidents. 
   * Secure middleware 
      * Services to proactively find and fix software vulnerabilities and guarantee deployed security software is current and correctly configured. 

_discussion_ <br>
ML - hopefully we can work to create more secure software<br>
DS - are you going to be software providers or services providers<br>
ML - Wisc will do a service<br>

DP - is it clear the cardinality of audit db's is per VO?<br>
BT - many VOs liked the idea<br>

ML - so how do we work together?<br>
DP - maybe it is useful for the many people to come to you<br>
DP - Software needs acceptance work<br>
ML - we have quite a bit of work to do after we get software to include/integrate/make it work for us<br>
ML - need to schedule the SOSCET-OSG meeting for joint plans<br>


---+++ Wednesday afternoon, August 23, 2006
   * VOs Responsibility and Agreements
      * Draft OSG VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo AUP 0.1 ([[%ATTACHURL%/OSG-VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoAUP-V0.1.doc][doc]], [[%ATTACHURL%/OSG-VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoAUP-V0.1.pdf][pdf]])
      * Slides from Bob Cowles ([[%ATTACHURL%/Grid_Security_-_OSGmeeting.ppt][ppt]])

---++++ Notes
Attendees: Bob C., Don P., Keith C., Dave K., Doug O., Vicky W., Gabriele G., Horst S., Bill K., Murali R., Eileen B., Lin Simon, Kazushige Saga

VOs provide & install software and there must be some expectations.<br>
_extended discussion_ <br>

   * for VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo AUP - VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo provides software, must have some configuration management process in place and some controls
   * consider having software checking automatically for updates
   * maybe need a software AUP
   * assume that every VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo knows and can contact all their users

   * what about transient light-weight VOs? a different trust model?
   * services policy probably needs updating

List of policies
   * services
   * software

Elements of VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo Policy
   * purpose
   * VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo agreement with it's users
   * users security contact
   * supply contact info
   * location of servers (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS)
   * responsive to complaints

If mis-use happens does the OSG have responsibility or is it a site & VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo reponsibilities?

BK - Sites provide resources to OSG and OSG then has some responsibility about the behavior of VOs

Is Peer-reviewed science a necessary component of granting access to resources on DOE (& NSF) provided resources?
