---+ OSG CA Transition

We in Open Science Grid operate a public key infrastructure (PKI) as part
of our identity management services, the goal of which is to allow for
authentication of users and services, and to allow for the expression of
virtual organization (VO) membership.
A key component is a certificate authority (CA), currently operated by
ESNET: the DOE Grids CA.  OSG now has an agreement with ESNET and DOE ASCR
to transition support for this functionality, with the goal to have a smooth
transition without affecting the quality and availability of the service to
the OSG users. 

OSG has been working with ESNET to develop and evaluate the options and
present a recommendation on the path to proceed. The recommended path is to
prototype outsourcing the CA to a commercial company, !DigiCert and then if
successful, utilize !DigiCert to replace the ESNet CA in the OSG PKI.  A
pilot project phase for this path is being actively pursued and an initial
agreement with !DigiCert for use of their certificates in this phase has been
reached.  The "OSG CA Activity" is led by Von Welch of Indiana University
with a team including Mine Altunay, Jim Basney and Chander Sehgal.

The pilot project plan includes acquiring both user and host certificates
from !DigiCert and testing them in the OSG Integration Testbed (ITB) with
several different applications from the main OSG communities. We will also
be testing  with the OSG processes such as the Registration Authority
Interface and scripts that obtain host certificates.The goal is for OSG to
implement a replacement for the DOE Grids CA into production in about a
year, with a further year for the ramp down of all OSG dependence on DOE
Grids CA services.

---++ Frequently Asked Questions

---+++I heard !DigiCert CA is a commercial CA. Does this transition mean that my local site will pay for certificates?

No, OSG's contract with !DigiCert will allow certificates to be issued to OSG participants at no additional cost.

---+++Wasn't !DigiCert recently compromised?

No. The CA that was compromised was !Digicert Sdn. Bhd., a Malaysian company which has no relationship with the U.S. company !DigiCert based in Utah. Quoting from the [[http://www.entrust.net/advisories/malaysia.htm][Entrust advisory]]:

<blockquote>Digicert Sdn. Bhd. (Digicert Malaysia) is a certificate authority based in Malaysia. There is no relationship to !DigiCert Inc. based in Utah, US.</blockquote>
