---++ Background

We in the Open Science Grid operate a public key infrastructure (PKI) as part of our identity management services. The  goal of the PKI is to allow for
authentication of users and services, collaboration with other infrastuctures (e.g., the WLCG), and to allow for the expression of virtual organization (VO) membership. A key component is a certificate authority (CA), currently operated by ESNET: the DOE Grids CA.  OSG now has an agreement with ESNET and DOE ASCR to transition support for this functionality, with the goal to have a smooth transition without affecting the quality and availability of the service to the OSG users. 

After an consideration of our options and a succssful pilot, we are in process of developing a replacement PKI utilizing a CA service contracted from [[https://www.digicert.com/][DigiCert]]. The "OSG PKI Transition Activity" is led by Von Welch of Indiana University with a team including Mine Altunay, Ruth Pordes and Chander Sehgal.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact osg-ra@opensciencegrid.org or any of the individuals listed in the prior paragraph.
