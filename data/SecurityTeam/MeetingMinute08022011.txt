Anand: 

itb cache. vdt ca manage is tested rsv ca probe is tested. we have nothing more to test. let's move everything to production for next week. concerned about yum and deb packages. the new packages are not labeled in yum repo and conflicts are not marked. yum docuemntation must also indicate this clearly. since we will control which sites will do transitioning. we will start with sites that do the vdt-ca-manage. 
verify that if a site yum osg-ca-certs they get the old certs. let;s have a call with scott. which sites are using yum and debian. 

anand asked them last week where to get the crlurl file and the new end user certificates. updated the ticket. Mike and Dhiva has not responded. 

ste report is done. updated. 

site admins meeting is going on. user forum. security presentation. asked marco and suchandra rob snihur for site admin meeting. not requested for security training for site admins. check what do they need in site admins meeting.
