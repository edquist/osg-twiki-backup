   * Reviewed new [[https://fermi.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=incident.do%3Fsys_id=386cf7126f70c64032544d1fde3ee4d9%26sysparm_stack=incident_list.do%3Fsysparm_query=active=true][code]] from Art Kreymer managing renewal and cleanup of jobsub kerberos keytabs, found a couple of small problems
   * Read [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2602087.2602107][article]] from CISR'14 on interesting lightweight security for Internet of Things
   * For certless logging, code from Brian for GUMS and code from Mischa for new lcmaps plugin are ready and I need to try them.  A small patch to production lcmaps plugin necessary to support the new feature is now being readied for release by OSG.
   * For KCA replacement, based on feedback from Brian & Mischa that it's not good to proliferate command-line prompting for credentials, I now think we need to go back to the plan of using Shibboleth and myproxy.  If permitted by Fermilab we should use ssh credentials, managed via web, for user to get cert from myproxy.  Then the main sticking point is how to ensure that the user renews the cert in myproxy yearly.  Olga didn't think we could automaticaly tie to the every 6 month service password renewal.  Could perhaps the ssh connection give warnings when there's less than a month left, and an error when the time is up, telling the user to re-authenticate on the web interface?

---++ Jeny
   * Conducted Security Training for new VO: LZ.
   * Research for Identity Management and Access Control in !IoT
   * Rewriting instructions on how to build the certificates bundle: current ones are outdated and incomplete.
      * Received new instructions to include osg-ca-certs and igtf-ca-certs in OSG 3.3 package
   * Check the CVEs in a regular basis to don't miss the vulnerabilities announcement
   * Send a security advisory for CVE-2015-3245, CVE-2015-3246
