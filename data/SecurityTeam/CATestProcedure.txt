---+ OSG CA Testing Plan

---++ Purpose
The OSG CA was designed with a modular architecture, so new back-end signing CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to verify a new signing CA is working correctly.

---++ Must remember

1. Remind CMS and ATLAS to test workflows (post IGTF accreditation in October 2015)

2. Before we configure production OIM to use CILogon HSM on the backend, we must notify all who may want to renew their existing Digicert certificates

---++ Testing Phases

| *Phase* | *Owner* | *Co-ordinator* | *Duration* |  *Status* |
| All CA functions work correctly with the new signing CA | Kevin/Neha | Neha | _4/1/15 - 4/30/15_ | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | 
| Testing on ITB servers to uncover any issues with the new certs and existing OSG software | ITB Testers | Neha | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ORANGE% |
| VOs to test custom software/workflows with new certificates | VO Managers | Neha | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %BROWN%CMS/ATLAS CAN NOT START UNTIL OCT 2015%ENDCOLOR% |
| OSG Services testing with new certificates | OSG services operators | Neha/Mine | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ENDCOLOR% |

---+++ Test Details

   * (1) RSV CRL errors, which may or may not be related to this CA update: https://osgitb1.nhn.ou.edu/rsv/ -- this was apparently not related to CILogon directly, but caused by some CAs having been removed, with only the .r0 files left, which caused these errors ...
   * (2) I had to add the following line to */etc/condor-ce/condor_mapfile* (will be fixed in next release):
GSI "^\/DC\=org\/DC\=opensciencegrid\/O=Open Science Grid\/OU\=Services\/CN\=(host\/)?([A-Za-z0-9.\-]*)$" \2@daemon.opensciencegrid.org

---+++ Known Issues
Url for JIRA tickets that will be created for items that require fixing should be included here.
   * (1) 
   * (2) 

---++ VO-specific Software Test
VO manager should test all VO specific software that handles certificates.

Note: CILogon OSG CA certs won't be installed on CERN nodes until it's IGTF accreditation ( Oct 15' 2015). So CMS and ATLAS workflow testing cannot begin until then.
