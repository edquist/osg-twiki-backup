---+ OSG CA Testing Plan

---++ Purpose
The OSG CA was designed with a modular architecture, so new back-end signing CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to verify a new signing CA is working correctly.

---++ Testing Phases

| *Phase* | *Owner* | *Co-ordinator* | *Duration* |  *Status* |
| All CA functions work correctly with the new signing CA | OSG Operations/OSG Security Team/Neha | | _4/1/15 - 4/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ENDCOLOR% | 
| Testing on ITB servers to uncover any issues with the new certs and existing OSG software | ITB Site Admins | Neha/OSG Security | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ORANGE% |
| VOs to test custom software/workflows with new certificates | VO Managers | Neha/OSG Security | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %ORANGE%IN PROGRESS%ENDCOLOR% |
| OSG Services testing with new certificates | Admins hosting services for OSG | Neha/OSG Security | _5/1/15 - 6/30/15_ | %RED%NOT STARTED%ENDCOLOR% |

---++ CA Functionality Tests

| *Scenerio* | *Use Case* | *Status* | *Notes* |
| Getting Personal Cert | Request, approve and import new certificate into browsers | | |
| | New DN should appear in expected format | | |
| | Numeric prefix should be the same as in the old certificate | | |
| Renewing Personal Cert | Renew new certs | | May be issues with testing this with production setup without waiting 13 months.Should be able to test a shorter lived cert. |
| | Test whether users with existing !DigiCert certs can get new certificates without going through identity vetting | | |
| Revoking User Cert| Revoke certificate via OIM interface| | |
| |Verify certificate's serial number appears in published CRL within expected time limit (? hours) | | |
| Getting Host Cert|Get host cert via command line tools | | |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | | |
| | Get host cert via OIM web interface | | |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | | |
| Revoking Host Cert | Revoke host cert via OIM web interface | | |
| | Verify certificate's serial number appears in published CRL within expected time limit (? hours) | | |
| Getting Service Cert|Get service cert via command line tools | | |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | | |
| | Get service cert via OIM web interface | | |
| | Verify DN matches old certificate with new prefix | | |
| Revoking Service Cert | Revoke service cert via OIM web interface | | |
| | Verify certificate's serial number appears in published CRL within expected time limit (? hours) | | |

---+++ Testers

Instructions for ITB Testers

   * Install [[http://pepperjack.fnal.gov/repo/1.0/][CA certs]] for the new signing CA ( temporary location to expedite testing )
   * Request [[https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificaterequestuser][User]] and [[https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificaterequesthost][Host/Service]] certificates
   * Deploy the new host/service certs on server nodes and restart services
   * Generate VOMS credentials using new user cert
   * Run Service tests as mentioned below
