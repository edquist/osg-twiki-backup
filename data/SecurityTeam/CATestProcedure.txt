---+ OSG CA Test Procedure
The OSG CA was designed with a modular backend, so new CAs can be used to do the actual certificate signing. This is the procedure to verify a new backend CA is working correctly.

---++ testing plan:
To verify that new certificates are working correctly, assign a test VO to get certificates signed by the new CA, then verify:

---+++ getting new user cert
new cert should be able to be requested, approved and imported into browsers.

---+++ renewing user cert
new certs should be able to be renewed successfully. May be issues with testing this with production setup without waiting 13 months. Should be able to test a shorter lived cert.

---+++ revoking user cert
verify new certs can be revoked and propagated via CRLs correctly.

---+++ getting host cert
get a new cert with both web and command line tools.

---+++ renewing host cert
host certs can't really be renewed, just replaced. included for completeness.

---+++ revoking host cert
host certs should be able to be revoked and propagated to published CRLs correctly.

---+++ adding to voms
should be able to add new CA signed cert to existing VOMS account and be sucessfully approved. New user registration with new cert should also work. voms-proxy-init with new cert should work.

---+++ adding to gums
running jobs with new cert when mapped via gums should work correctly.

---+++ submitting jobs to condor
submit test job with VOMS proxy derived from new CA cert should run correctly.

---+++ gridftp
should be able to authenticate and transfer files with proxies derived from new CA signed certs.

---+++ ask wider audience to test other software with new certs.
