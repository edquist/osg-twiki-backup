Marco:
   * SSL renegotiation problem will be fixed when ESNet upgrade the CA software. Ticket 11250 is updated. 
      * Misc certificate doc has a workaround explained. 
      * Talked to Thomas Bezenoles. They will check which browsers are affected and adjust the documentation.

Kevin: 
   * Will check the security of the workaround suggested for the SSL renegotiation problem. 
   * No vulnerabilities
   * Twiki vulnerability. Opened a ticket. Does not sound too important. Recommended include the fix whenever they do a regular upgrade.
   * Ticket opened on adding software contacts on the security announcements. 
   * Ticket JIRA 34 : do not send security related tickets in open email. 
   * Security announcements  are signed with team's key. EOL signs are violating the pg key. This is due to copying a text field into the html field and eol signs are misinterpreted.
