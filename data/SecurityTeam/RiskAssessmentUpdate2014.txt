---+ Risk Trash/Trash/Trash/Assessment Update 2014

Based on results from 2014's security controls assessments there are several areas to look at to improve security for the OSG going forward.

The first is with the security controls assessments procedures itself. There are several areas relying on individuals being familar with all VOs or their representatives. OSG has grown to the point where this probably isn't practical going forward. For things like verifying contacts in OIM, some sort of systematic updating/verifying should be investigated.

Many processes are still documented to use email lists for discussion, but in fact GOC tickets are the preferred method for communications. These procedures should be updated and unused mail lists can be recycled.

Getting all our annual security surveys completed and returned has been challenging. This was the first year where the survey was done in the form of a twiki page, going under the theory that next year respondents can copy and update their previous years responses. Hopefully this will get responses quicker than this year. We might want to look at some existing online survey packages as well.

Some responses indicated that they have not tested restoring systems/data from backups. We should encourage everyone to do a restore test periodically. Perhaps this could be a topic for training at the OSG AHM.

Two factor authentication for sysadmins of core systems should be encouraged where possible.

With the ongoing traceability project, we might want to consider an OSG wide user directory. We may also want to investigate ways to ban a compromised individual account OSG wide. Currently there is not a way to do this, as was accepted with the traceability project, but may still be worth investigating.
