---++ Status as of August 14 2006

Actively running two production jobs on fngp_osg.fnal.gov.  Due to
historical reasons, these production jobs cannot be run on other
sites. This is due to the peculiarities of these two jobs, not a
generic issue. !SDSS can quickly start running production on other
sites using different jobs. This was verified some time in the past by
submitting various test jobs to several sites; there is no
list of successful sites because the sites are changing fast and it
was a while ago. !SDSS does not have any other production jobs to run yet
besides these two, and this is why !SDSS is not exploiting other
sites. 
In the framework of the DES (Dark Energy Survey) data challenge event
the Fermilab DES group is planning to run image simulation jobs to simulate
500 squere degrees of sky images. This task is estimated to requare 6,000 CPU hours,
and will produce about 2 TBytes of data. These jobs will be run on OSG sites with help
of GGG package. We expect to start production in September 2006.
