---+ User information for the fermilab VO

---++ About the fermilab VO
The *fermilab VO* (note the lower-case "f" in the VO name), associated with [[http://www.fnal.gov][Fermilab]] (upper-case!), in Batavia, Illinois, comprises several "sub-VOs", each of which represents a high-energy physics experiment or related project.  The fermilab VO, managed under the auspices of [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][the Fermigrid project]], makes use of the [[Documentation/VORolesAndGroups][groups and roles feature]] in the VO management software to designate each experiment or project as a top-level group of the VO.  The groups are then free to create a hierarchy of lower-level groups and a series of roles, and use them to define privileges.

See the [[https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/voms/fermilab/webui/admin/groups/list][list of groups in the fermilab VO]].

---++ How to register with the fermilab VO

The fermilab VO uses the [[http://computing.fnal.gov/docs/products/vomrs/][VOMRS software]], to manage registration with the VO. If you have an active Fermilab Kerberos principal, then the credentials corresponding to your x509 Kerberos CA user certificate will be automatically registered in the fermilab VO. If you have credentials from a DOE Grids user certificate that you wish to register with the fermilab VO, then you must complete the fermilab VO registration process.  To register, go to the [[https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/vomrs/vo-fermilab/vomrs][fermilab instance of VOMRS]].  More information is available at [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/user-guide-0.4.1.html#Vo-Registration][VO registration]].

---++ Policies
Your use of the Open Science Grid (OSG) is subject to your acceptance of the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][OSG User Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)]].

Regarding the FermiGrid processing policy, see the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/policy.html][FermiGrid - Fermilab OSG Policy Page]].

---++ User Documentation

The [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][Fermigrid home page]] provides links to a wealth of information, including a [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/user-guides.html][User guide]], which is intended as a start-to-finish procedural guide.  As such, it contains the Fermilab-specific user information, and duplicates some of the OSG-wide information collected in the ReleaseDocumentation twiki area. 

---++ Choosing OSG resources for your job

OSG does not yet have a resource broker (middleware that automatically directs your job to a specific resource based on current load and various requirements).  You have to be your own!  Start at the  [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi][VORS VO resource selector]].  Select  _OSG_ as your grid (top line), and _Fermilab_ as your VO (grey boxes under the map).  And yes, they've written it with an upper-case F...

Scroll down to Resources.  Here are listed all the sites that have agreed to support the fermilab VO.  At this point you have to investigate to determine a good choice.  !GridCat can help.  Go to the [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/][OSG GridCat page]].  Look for a site with a green dot, and a small but non-zero activity level (look under Jobs). Make sure it's running the right version of the OSG software stack.  This doesn't guarantee you success...

The fermilab VO runs a probe to test sites.  To see what sites are responding well, look at the probe results:
   * From the http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/ home page, click _FermiGrid Metrics and Service Monitors_.  
   * See the table labelled _FermiGrid - fermilab Virtual Organization probe_.
   * Look for _fermilab VO probe - Production Gridcat_, and click _plots_.
   * In the plots, notice that the blue VORS line does not line up with the green success line (some sites that VORS says should work don't actually work).
   * Go back and click _Summary_ now.
   * Choose a site from the top table labelled _The following sites passed all tests at (recent time)_.
