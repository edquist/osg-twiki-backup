---++ How to register with the fermilab VO

The fermilab VO uses the [[https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/vomrs/vo-fermilab/vomrs][VOMRS software]], to manage registration with the VO. If you have an active Fermilab Kerberos principal, then the credentials corresponding to your x509 Kerberos CA user certificate will be automatically registered in the fermilab VO. If you have credentials from a DOE Grids user certificate that you wish to register with the fermilab VO, then you must complete the fermilab VO registration process.  To register, go to the [[https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/vomrs/vo-fermilab/vomrs][fermilab instance of VOMRS]].  More information is available at [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/user-guide-0.4.1.html#Vo-Registration][VO registration]].

You will be automatically registered in the _null_ group (i.e., not affiliated with any experiment or project).  To register with a particular one, %RED%can't you register with vomrs and choose one, or do you have to go talk to the sub-VO contact person?%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Policies
Your use of the Open Science Grid (!OSG) is subject to your acceptance of the [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=86][OSG User Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)]].

Regarding the !FermiGrid processing policy, see the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/policy.html][FermiGrid - Fermilab OSG Policy Page]].

---++ fermilab VO and !FermiGrid User and Admin Documentation

   * [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov][FermiGrid home page]] provides links to a wealth of information
   * [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/user-guides.html][FermiGrid User guide]], intended as a start-to-finish procedural guide.  As such, it contains the Fermilab-specific user information, and duplicates some of the !OSG-wide information collected in the [[ReleaseDocumentation]] twiki area. 
   * [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/admin-guides.html][FermiGrid Admin Guide]] intended for Fermilab Grid Users and System Administrators in charge of the !OSG middleware installation and configuration. It is a rough guide to the installation and configure the !OSG middleware on the on the top of the Linux distributions at Fermilab.

---++ Choosing <nop>OSG resources for your job

!OSG does not yet have a resource broker (middleware that automatically directs your job to a specific resource based on current load and various requirements).  You have to be your own!  Start at the  [[http://vors.grid.iu.edu/cgi-bin/index.cgi][VORS VO resource selector]].  Select  _!OSG_ as your grid (top line), and _Fermilab_ as your VO (grey boxes under the map).  And yes, they've written it with an upper-case F...

Scroll down to Resources.  Here are listed all the sites that have agreed to support the fermilab VO.  At this point you have to investigate to determine a good choice.  !GridCat can help.  Go to the [[http://osg-cat.grid.iu.edu/][OSG GridCat page]].  Look for a site with a green dot, and a small but non-zero activity level (look under Jobs). Make sure it's running the right version of the !OSG software stack.  This doesn't guarantee you success...

The fermilab VO runs a probe to test sites.  To see what sites are responding well, look at the probe results:
   * From the http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/ home page, click _FermiGrid Metrics and Service Monitors_.  
   * See the table labelled _FermiGrid - fermilab Virtual Organization probe_.
   * Look for _fermilab VO probe - Production Gridcat_, and click _plots_.
   * In the plots, notice that the blue VORS line does not line up with the green success line (some sites that VORS says should work don't actually work).
   * Go back and click _Summary_ now.
   * Choose a site from the top table labelled _The following sites passed all tests at (recent time)_.
