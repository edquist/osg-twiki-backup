CDF users are blissfully unaware that the grid exists, and CDF likes it that way.
Use of the grid for CDF works via a portal interface, the CAF, which hides any and all
complexity of the grid.

All a CDF user needs is a fnal.gov kerberos principle, and access to the CDF computing facilities
at Fermilab. The portal generates an X509 proxy from the krb5 ticket, and makes sure that
that proxy is valid at runtime.

Any and all user support is organized via CDF support channels.
