---++ Status as of June 26 2006

!DZERO successfully submitted jobs to the following sites:

<verbatim>
red.unl.edu:2119/jobmanager-pbs
spgrid.if.usp.br:2119/jobmanager-condor
atlas.iu.edu:2119/jobmanager-pbs
osg.rcac.purdue.edu:2119/jobmanager-pbs
tier2-01.ochep.ou.edu:2119/jobmanager-condor
grid1.oscer.ou.edu:2119/jobmanager-lsf
cmsgrid02.hep.wisc.edu:2119/jobmanager-condor
</verbatim>

!DZERO is planning to include more sites. !DZERO needs to certify their jobs on a site before they
start actively submitting to it. This certification process takes a long time and seems to be the bottleneck for now.
