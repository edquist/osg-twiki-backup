No attempts to include new sites have been made since July.

---++ Status as of July 12 2006

Currently nanoHUB is helping researchers at !UIUC conduct a simulation study of
ion transfer in artificial membranes. The simulation study is being used to
investigate a wide parameter space involving several variables. Each
simulation is expected to require from one to six weeks to complete on a
single processor. In total the plan is to run more than one thousand of these
individual simulations to study the impact of the various parameters.

!OSG provides a unique resource to be able to accomplish the objective. Several
members of !OSG have accepted jobs and nanohub is working to recruit more willing
members.

More information about the simulation tool can be found 
  [[https://www.nanohub.org/simulation_tools/biomoca_tool_information][here]].

A nanohub application requires 6-10 days to run on a typical !OSG site.

Nanohub jobs run successfully at Purdue and !UNM. The run time cutoff there
Nanohub jobs are set up in principle to run at !LIGO, Penn State and
Vanderbilt but these sites do not allow jobs longer than 2 days.  Nanohub
Nanohub jobs are set up in principle to run at Penn State (!OSG_LIGO_PSU) and
Vanderbilt (vampire.accre.vanderbilt.edu) but these sites do not allow jobs longer than 2 days.  Nanohub
applications need a suspend-and-resume functionality at the application level. 
Nanohub is working on it now.

Running nanohub jobs at Fermilab has been difficult in general. There is
no run time limit but nanohub jobs are run at a low priority and so they
are preempted by other jobs. Effectively there is a short run time limit,
20 mins to half an hour, due to this preemption.

Caltech (CIT_CMS_T2) and Buffalo sites offered to run nanohub
applications. Nanohub also had some discussion with Florida_PG and there
is no objection on Florida's part to running nanohub. These sites do not
enforce a run limit policy.

Nanohub is looking to expand the list of sites they can run on, with help from applications coordinators and the !OSG executive team.
