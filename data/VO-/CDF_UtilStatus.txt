---++ Status as of August 22nd, 2006

!CDF uses glide-ins to run jobs on 4 !OSG sites: FNAL_FERMIGRID,
MIT_CMS, osg-gw-2.t2.ucsd.edu, and USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE. Utilization of
!OSG sites is irregular depending on the proximity to major conferences
and Monte Carlo demand and varies from 0 to over 1000 batch slots at
any given time.

The plans for future !OSG sites utilization are unclear at this
point. The three users who have ever submitted grid jobs for !CDF are
expected to be gone by November. !CDF may expand utilization of !OSG
resources starting with !CMS T2's and adding more sites as necessary.

New CDF ops team for OSG operations exists. CDF is committed to slowly but surely
move all sites they have access to into one glide-in driven system they call NamCAF (Nam=North America).
Near term candidates for inclusion in addition to the listed sites above are Wisconsin and Florida on OSG,
and Toronto on LCG.
