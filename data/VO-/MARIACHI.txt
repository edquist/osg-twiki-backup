---++ !MARIACHI Virtual Organization

!MARIACHI ( Mixed-Apparatus for Radar Investigation of Atmospheric Cosmic-rays of High Ionization ) is a project funded by NSF CI-Team (!CyberInfrastructure) to promote the use of next-generation computer technology for science, scientific collaboration, and science education.  The specific scientific goal of the project is to create and refine a distributed cosmic ray detector system using low-cost radio recievers, which capture and analyze the radio signals reflected off the atmospheric ionization trails produced by high-energy cosmic rays striking our atmosphere.  

Using Cosmic Ray Physics as a jumping off point, !MARIACHI aims to make grid computing and cutting-edge scientific computing techniques accessible to high-school students and their teachers, University undergraduates and graduate students, and working !PhD researchers in data-intensive areas of science.
