The are several ILC applications which run on the grid, but they run as self-contained applications.  These applications are presently either accelerator or [[http://ilc.fnal.gov/detector/rd/physics/technical/simulation/simreco_technical.shtml][detector]] simulation studies.  We hope there is no need for any application support, or software installation. Everything a job needs it brings in with itself via the standard grid tools.
