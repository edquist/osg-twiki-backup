%TOC%

---++ Overview

The fermilab VO (note the lower-case "f" in the VO name), associated with Fermilab (upper-case!), in Batavia, Illinois, comprises several "sub-VOs", each of which represents a high-energy physics experiment or related project at Fermilab. The fermilab VO is managed under the auspices of the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/][FermiGrid project]]. !FermiGrid is the name for the "meta-facility" established by the Fermilab Computing Division (CD). The goal of !FermiGrid is to make all Fermilab computing facilities able to interoperate and run all types of grid jobs. !FermiGrid will also provide a unified grid gateway to the outside grid world.

For more information, read the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/introduction.html][Introduction to Fermigrid]].  This document addresses:
   * Common grid services
   * Stakeholder Bi-Lateral Interoperability
   * Open Science Grid Interfaces
   * Permanent Storage System Interfaces

Read [[http://grid.fnal.gov/fermigrid/][background information on the design and deployment of FermiGrid]].

---++ The fermilab VO's implementation of !OSG software
---+++ General
From the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/][fermigrid.fnal.gov]] page, click the links under _FermiGrid Components_ to see the services and interfaces that are implemented.
---+++ VO Management
We implement a VOMS service, interfaced to the VOMRS software for user registration.  The fermilab VO
makes use of the groups and roles feature in the VO management software to designate each experiment or project  (each "sub-VO") as a top-level group of the VO. The groups are then free to create a hierarchy of lower-level groups and a series of roles, and use them to define privileges.

See the [[https://voms.fnal.gov:8443/vomses/][list of groups in the fermilab VO]].   To find the names of the group-specific VOMS administrators,  drill down as follows. From the [[http://fermigrid.fnal.gov/][fermigrid.fnal.gov]] page,
   * Common Grid Services (left hand menu)
   * In the table displayed, under the column titled _VOMS Service (admin only)_, click _fermilab-voms_.
   * In the blue nav bar, click _Administer the VO_.
   * In the blue nav bar, click _List of Groups_.
   * In the list displayed, click your group (your experiment or project).  This brings up a list of DNs for the VOMS administrators for your group.
