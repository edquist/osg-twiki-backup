---+++ Communications and OSG Newsletter Surveys - Miriam Boon

   * As of July 13, I will be coming on board to work directly on OSG communications 50% of my time. One of the activities I will be spending more time on is the OSG Newsletter. I want to make sure that the newsletter is meeting the needs of the OSG staff and program, with the eventual goal of a well-considered re-design. 

   * Ruth Pordes and I agree that the newsletter should have a casual, approachable, and friendly style. At first glance, its purpose is to keep people up to date, and to communicate and disseminate what has happened and what is happening with the OSG Consortium and project. But there are also several other possible goals that we should explore before moving forward with the re-design. 

   * Towards that end, we are conducted a very brief survey, which addresses those and other questions about the purpose of the newsletter. It should only take a few moments of your time, but your answers will help us to make some important decisions. Please take a moment to fill it out by clicking on this link:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/OSGNewsletterPurpose

   * In addition to the smaller survey linked above, we’re conducting a reader survey for all of our readers to fill out. If you have not already filled that out, I’d ask that you take the time to fill it out as well, and forward it to your colleagues who interact with OSG. You can do so at this link:
