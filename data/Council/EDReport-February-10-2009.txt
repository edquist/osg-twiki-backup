---++ Review

The review seemed to go well. The slides, questions etc are posted at  http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2294 (I will give the access code in the meeting).

The only official response to date was a summary at the closeout:

1.	OSG is a very critical piece of the infrastructure for the LHC and potentially important for LIGO.<br>
2.	This initiative has significant potential value for other large-scale science endeavors.<br>
3.	Clear that model for incorporating new HW resources can be successful – i.e. enabled CDF resources for D0 re-processing.<br>
4.	Some panelists felt that scientific productivity argument could be presented in a more compelling manner.<br>
5.	Reliance on HEP-VO model may not map for new VOs (homogeneity, unified purpose not in place for most other communities)<br>
a.	Can’t rely on interaction with VOs to effectively represent what’s happening in end user community.<br>
6.	 National cyberinfrastructure, of this type (OSG) is important, getting established and funding agencies need to appreciate the importance of this evolution.  Encourage broad thinking on this by agencies and researchers.<br>
a.	Larger returns possible from serving large scale science (short term) communities. (i.e. climate community)<br>
7.	 Continue to engage in the larger strategic questions of national cyberinfrastructure(s) among relevant parties.  Continue to iterate on the best rules and framework for federation – evolutionary and strategic for all large cyberinfrastructures – be focused and need-driven (i.e. archival storage).  Create conditions at the right levels for discussion of frontier issues of cyberinfrastructures.<br>
8.	Presentations addressed the charge questions, but didn’t tell OSG’s excellent story in a cohesive way. Led with management structure, more effective to lead with the vision, purpose, mechanisms and science accomplishments. (i.e. architecture diagrams at the beginning – and one level up)<br>

---++ Production Coordinator
There have been 2 applicants for production coordinate. The Executive Team, Council Co-chairs, Operations Coordinator and co-leads of the Software Tools Group have interviewed both candidates. Based on the feedback I have made a recommendation for a 1 year commitment to date. 

---++ New Council Member
I would like to recommend SBGrid have a place on the Council. Kent has invited Piotr Sliz to the March Council meeting where we would make a presentation for membership. 

---++ Usage of OSG increasing
The usage of OSG is continuing to grow with the ramp up of all physics VOs and SBGrid. http://www.opensciencegrid.org/Usage_Stats
