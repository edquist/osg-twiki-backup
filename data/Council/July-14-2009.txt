---+++ Report(s) from the OSG Executive Team

[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Council/EDReport-July14-2009][Executive Directors report]]

Ruth reported on the two workshops (documentation and storage) in the report. These are focused on near term goals for the next year's planning. It was also noted that there are several papers submitted (see report) which will be summarized at the Face-to-Face next month with long term view of future. More Tier 3s expected to come on line and will need support, for example it was identified at the storage workshop that for up to 100 cpus clusters, NFS based storage over SRM/Bestman is a workable solution - working to put together documentation on this configuration to give to the Tier 3s. There are currently about 25 to 30 Tier 3s. There is not a concrete growth profile, but it is expected to double. Michael pointed out that the DOE (and to some extent the NSF) have made funding available to support Tier 3s resulting in quite a few proposals. This will definitely have an impact on the growth of the Tier 3s. Ruth noted that this has implications on the scalability of our support and will be a topic for on going discussion.
