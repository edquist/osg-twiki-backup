Subject: Request for OSG support for DZero processing utilizing local storage

Dear Ruth,

At yesterday's OSG Council telecon the Council heard a request from
DZero to be able to utilize more OSG sites with local storage.
Interestingly, they are seeing nearly double the efficiency in their
processing jobs when utilizing local storage (see link below). They also
reported issues with site resources apparently not matching well with
what is being pulled down into their job submission system using ReSS
(it was recommended that a Trouble Ticket be filed at the GOC regarding
this). The required storage requirements (~300 GB average, though larger
in some cases) seem relatively modest.

Given the breadth of the experiences and issues being revealed by
DZero's use of OSG, storage, efficiency, troubleshooting, documentation,
resource selection, etc., it is the view of the OSG Council co-Chairs
that the OSG Project identify a means to provide some support and
tracking of progress for the DZero request.

Sincerely,
Kent Blackburn & Paul Avery
OSG Council co-Chairs
