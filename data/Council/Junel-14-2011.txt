   * Executive Director report

   * Planning for the future of the VDT - Alain Roy (Software Coordinator) 
      * Documents:  [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/CommunityPackagingProposal][Community Packaging Proposal]] and [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/NPTransition][Draft Transition document]] 
      * We have been looking carefully at the software packaging strategy for the next generation of OSG and are planning to make some important changes in the VDT that will help us provide better service to our community. The most significant of these changes is the transition from a Pacman based distribution to a distribution model based on RPMs (possibly incorporating additional Debian support in 2012). System administrators as well as users are expected to benefit from being able to more quickly deploy and use software updates and new OSG capabilities. Packaging with Pacman requires that all software must be completely repackaged, even if it is already packaged in some other format. By adopting a native package model within OSG, many new software capabilities that are increasingly being released natively can directly pass through into the latest OSG testing repository without need for extensive repackaging. Of course the OSG Software team will continue to provide the extensive test bed, VTB, and ITB testing that the OSG community has come to depend on.
      * We are planning for a freeze on Pacman package updates fairly quickly (June 2011), and expect to provide production-quality RPMs for Red Hat/Scientific Linux 5 to OSG stakeholders late this year and enable gradual transitions throughout 2012.
      * We are currently working on a plan to manage this transition and provide tools and support to help sites and VOs make the transition occur smoothly. The plan is still in draft form.
