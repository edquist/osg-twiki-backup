---++ OSG Council Subcommittee to address At-Large VO Representation

---+++ Purpose:

Review the current VO membership of the OSG, compare this with the current representation of the OSG Council members and make a recommendation for a process to appoint the two open "At-Large" representatives. The time line should assure that "At-Large" representatives have been appointed and available for participation no later than by the time of our next face-to-face Council Meeting in approximately 6 months (~September 2008). An important element of this process should be to contact VOs without current representation in order to understand their views of and needs from the OSG Council.

---+++ Membership:

Bill Kramer, Shaowen Wang, Dick Greenwood, Tom Furlani (NYSGrid), Ruth Pordes (ex-officio), Kent Blackburn, Paul Avery
