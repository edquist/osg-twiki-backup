 2. *Shaowen Wang & Doug Olson*; Develop and document a process for removing a council representative on the basis of participation. This should include an "inactive state", which also has a process for returning to "active status" based on the procedures to be developed and documented. This process should be reviewed by the council before ratification.

OSG BYLAWS STATEMENT:

_It is the intention that OSG Council members actively participate in Council and Consortium activities on a regular basis. Activities include teleconference, video conferences, face to face meetings, email voting, contributing to the work of the council, etc. A regular basis defined as participation in at least 1/2 of the council events a 6 month period._

DRAFT: 

_Every effort shall be made by the OSG Council to contact the organization before it is dropped from the Council, to ensure that this was the intention of the organization._

_A member organization can be suspended (defined as loss of voting privilege) by majority vote after review of their membership status at one of the regular face-to-face meetings, or upon recommendation for such a vote by one of the councilors, on the basis of an extended period of inactivity or non-compliance with membership responsibilities. To resume regular meeting attendance and participation in council activities can lead to the termination of suspension that shall be decided by the Council Chair or Co-Chairs._

_A member that remains in suspended status for more than 6 months shall be considered to have resigned from the OSG Council if steps are not taken to refresh its membership. Direct expulsion can also be considered in the case of severe violation of membership conditions. A resigned or expelled member may return to active status by following the same process as that for new membership._
