      * We have heard from NSF about their plans but no conclusion yet. Based on these plans we have submitted the Cooperative Agreement and Project Execution Plan for review. We are also contacting the different organizations with current OSG staff to discuss the plans for post March 31st 2012, which is the end date of the current statements of work.  We have started discussing in the Executive Team short term contingency plans if the NSF funds are not in place before the end of the current SOWs. We will decide and work to put these plans in place in the 2nd week of March if we don't hear anything definite from NSF by then. It is expected that the DOE funds will be in the BNL and Fermilab FIN plans in March.
