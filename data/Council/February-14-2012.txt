   * Status of OSG planning (Ruth)
      * We have heard from NSF about their plans but no conclusion yet. Based on these plans we have submitted the Cooperative Agreement and Project Execution Plan for review. We are also contacting the different organizations with current OSG staff to discuss the plans for post March 31st 2012, which is the end date of the current statements of work.  We have started discussing in the Executive Team short term contingency plans if the NSF funds are not in place before the end of the current SOWs. We will decide and work to put these plans in place in the 2nd week of March if we don't hear anything definite from NSF by then. It is expected that the DOE funds will be in the BNL and Fermilab FIN plans in March.
      * Work is proceeding to support the first users of OSG through the XSEDE allocation process and OSG-XSEDE submit host. Chander can report on this activity. 
      * The Executive Team has let the iSGTW board know that OSG /US editorial contributions to iSGTW will be frozen as of 1st April.

   * XSEDE and OSG (Rob Gardner)
      * The OSG VO support group has an activity aimed at enabling a researcher who gets an XSEDE allocation to be able to use OSG resources
      * Should OSG develop tools to provide transparent access to OSG and XSEDE resources?
         * (i.e. for those already OSG-engaged users who have XSEDE allocations)
         * Eg. based on glideins 
      * The activity above (getting an XSEDE user access to OSG resources, OSG being an XSEDE Resource Provider, the XSEDE user otherwise having no direct involvement through an existing VO)  needs to be understood in terms of which VO vehicle to use for both resource sharing negotiation and support.
