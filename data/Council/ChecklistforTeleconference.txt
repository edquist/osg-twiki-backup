---++++Checklist for OSG Teleconferences (and face to faces)

**Two weeks out

Make agenda template, including actions from previous month. Also check last month's agenda for carryover items, probably listed at bottom of minutes.

Action Items are listed here:
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Council/CouncilActionItems

Put a “council member check” on the agenda or at least ask co-chairs if they want to:

Remind co-chairs and Executive Team of the meeting and ask for agenda items.

Send a ‘save the date’ reminder to council, without agenda link.

**One week out

Make a point of trying to have a phone conversation with co-chairs (separately is OK)

Populate the agenda with input from co-chairs and ED.

Assign someone to each item, and confirm they accept to speak on it

(Put things in the right category)

(Question:  Should I leave a category up, if there’s no item that month?) (Answer so far: leave the standard ones of ED report, Co-chairs report, VOs, AOB)

**One week out (or maybe more) – Email Miron with agenda in message to ask for input

**One week out or at least Friday before – send reminder to council WITH agenda link.

**Meeting Day:  
Be available for last-minute agenda things, just in case.
Be available by IM.
Attend meeting (Rick or Paul initiates the ReadyTalk ad hoc, has the chairperson code).
Take roll and minutes.

**Afterward, the sooner the better (same day or next)
Edit minutes.
Send minutes to co-chairs for approval.
Post minutes on twiki:   https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/b
