Sebastien provided the following in an email to Kent and Paul on May 12th:

1. I believe we had a successful workshop at AHM09 were several
virtualization technologies and experiences were presented, the main
point out of the workshop is that there does not seem to be a clear
defintion of the problem that VM are solving which could be translated
into a requirement for sites. ATLAS and STAR presented successful use
of VM technologies, mostly motivated by an application packaging issue
(this needs to be checked with them ). Fermi presented what amounts to
be a server consolidation effort. The Globus Nimbus tool was featured
in several talk as a way to provision VMs.

Certainly STAR and ATLAS have clearly stated that they need VMs or are
using VMs. But CMS on the other end seemed much more cautious and
wanting performance numbers of sorts before committing efforts of a
production infrastructure to deal with technologies that are not
clearly solving a current problem.

2. In summary multiple technologies exist to provision and manage VMs
and several successes have happened on the user side. It seems hard to
me to translate this into a hard requirement for OSG. Certainly sites
who want to offer VM services can do so know if they wish, and VOs
could use that service if they wish. The main technical issue that I
see is the requirement that a site will have to support an hypervisor
on a large scale. To my knowledge this has not been done yet and it
raises some significant issues on the site side (not on the OSG
software side) like networking, security and operations.

3. My personal view is that virtualization can be used to build
scheduling overlays for VOs and that grid sites could evolve to be VM
providers instead of being farms to process jobs, in other terms grid
sites would become infrastructure providers and VOs would be left to
managed their software and jobs scheduling on there own. In some
regards an overlay network on which VOs schedule jobs and move data
can be seen as a cloud.

4. This personal view I believe is fairly in line with existing use of
pilot job frameworks and glideins, where a VO requests resources at a
site and after receiving an "allocation" schedules jobs onto those
resources.

As a side note, CERN IT is also struggling with the same issue and it
is not clear to them what VMs are solving. There seems to be a will to
build a local know how about VMs that could also extend to a future
Cloud strategy.

I hope this helps the discussion in 30 minutes,
I am still on the hook to work with Ruth and Miron to see how these
thoughts could be formulated into some kind of OSG view on
virtualization.
