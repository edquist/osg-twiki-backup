---++ SBGRID Background Documentation

---+++ The following is an extended version of the February OSG Newsletter on SBGrid

SBGrid is a consortium of 100 Structural Biology labs across the   country.  The central SBGrid team, based at Harvard Medical   School, provides an integrated computing environment with hundreds   of specialty software packages available for a range of platforms   (Linux, OS X, and SGI).  Over the past year SBGrid has become   increasingly involved with Open Science Grid both through the   provision of two compute clusters, available to all VOs, and in   the development of novel workflows for computationally intensive   protein structure determination.  Structural biology is a critical   field at the boundary of biology, physics, and chemistry, studying   the bio-mechanics of cellular processes mediated by proteins at an   atomic level resolution. Current techniques to determine the   physical geometry (conformation) of protein structures is time   consuming, possibly taking many person-months to complete.  SBGrid   is developing techniques that will automate the process and will   include information from the existing database of 50,000   macromolecular structures. This has relied on replication of the   corpus of 150,000 known macromolecular domains, requiring 40 GB of   persisted storage space, to all OSG sites used by the workflow.  A   challenging aspect is collating and presenting the resulting data,   which, for a single study, consists of tens of thousands of files   and approximately 3 GB of data.  Web-based data visualization has   been developed to facilitate this step.

Since the start of the   year SBGrid has utilized over 10,000 hours of compute time on   remote OSG compute resources, running more than 5,000 jobs.
In process of deploying its current work-flows SBGrid has   established a significant grid expertise and will now also lead   the regional effort in Boston area to expand affiliations with the   Open Science Grid. The SBGrid Computing School scheduled for May   6-8, 2009 (http://school.sbgrid.org), will host a special OSG   session and participants will be able to enroll in one of three   specialized computing workshops (data animation, OSX programming   and Scientific Python).
