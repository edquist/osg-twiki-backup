---++ At-Large VO Representation Sub-Committee Kick-Off Meeting

---+++ Teleconfernce Coordinates:

   * *Date:* April 25th, 2008
   * *Time:* 4PM Eastern, 3PM Central, 1PM Pacific
   * *Duration:* ~ 1 Hour
   * *Teleconference Number:* 1-800-704-9896
   * *Participant Code:* 779069 followed by the '#' key

   * *Attending:* 

---+++ Agenda/Minutes:

---++++ Introductions from Sub-Committee Members

   * Would be good to gather any experiences from you and your VO that may relate to the needs of an "At-Large" VO

---++++ Appoint Sub-Committee Chair

   * Important to have a democratic process to represent to the full OSG Council

---++++ Review of Charge to Sub-Committee

__Review the current VO membership of the OSG, compare this with the current representation of the OSG Council members and make a recommendation for a process to appoint the two open "At-Large" representatives. The time line should assure that "At-Large" representatives have been appointed and available for participation no later than by the time of our next face-to-face Council Meeting in approximately 6 months (~September 2008). An important element of this process should be to contact VOs without current representation in order to understand their views of, and needs from the OSG Council.__

---++++ Review of VOs not currently represented on OSG Council

   * Note that this is not completely straight forward given that characterization of the Council Membership involves representation not only by VO, but also by facility and partnerships. The table below is a first cut at identifying VOs which do not have representation and may need to be updated with additional inputs from individuals more familiar with breakdown than I (KB):

---++++ Discussion of "out-reach" methods to understand these VOs

   * Should we draft a survey for each of these VOs?
   * Should we do a complete interviewing or would a spot set of interviews be adequate?
   * Possibly some combination of the two methods mentioned above?

---++++ Brief discussion of thoughts on selection processes for the two open "at-large VO" seats on Council

---++++ Plan our next (and future) teleconferences
