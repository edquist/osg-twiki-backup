---++++Meetings

*Virginia Tech Visit:*  Oct 27th. OSG discussions at Virginia Tech with CIO, Dean of Science school, physics department on OSG experiences, lessons learned, help for them to kick off a campus wide cyberinfrastructure and integrate their new research facilty in Washington DC with Blackburgs (2011).  

*Blueprint Oct:*
Blueprint discussions to bring new Security Team member from NCSA in to the loop; touch base with Philippe on Gratia testing and handling of “missing data” – very difficult problem but some new ideas surfaced; and OSG support for Tier-3s – goal is a V1 installation guide by Christmas. Tanya is contributing significantly here. 

*Technology Group:*
Technology Group met in first week of Nov. Homework for architecture document. Technology Group notes will come from John Hover.
<br>Status of OSG TG Principles action items<br>

*Joint ESNET - OSG ID Management Workhop:*
In progress in Madison Nov 9 and 10th. 

<hr>

*Status of Items in  Shared Principles document between OSG and Teragrid.*

1.    Enact ways to collaborate at the management and implementation levels.<br>
Cross-project teams will be formed of individuals who have time allocated for joint activities. ...<br>
<i>A project plan is in progress for iSGTW. Should we be looking at one for the Engage SCEC work given the current understanding that this is an application that can benefit from running on OSG as well as TeraGrid?</i>

.. appoint a delegate to serve as an ex-officio member of the other at OSG semi-annual Executive Council meetings, and TG’s Quarterly Meetings.<br>
<i>Paul attended the TG Quarterly meeting in September and we have asked Chander to attend the meeting in December.</i>

2.    Develop a clearer understanding of each other’s organization, purpose and scope.<br>
High-level organization will be shared: Paul Avery, co-principal investigator and founding member of OSG will present at the September 24-25, 2009 TG Quarterly Meeting,  and John Towns, TG Forum Chair, will present at the August 10, 2009 OSG Executive Council meeting.<br>
<i>Done.</i>

Working group-level discussions will begin with Matt Heinzel, TeraGrid GIG director’s participation in an OSG Area Coordinators phone meeting.<br>
<i>not yet started pending completion of reorgnization of Area Coordinator time slot. </i>

3.    Develop ways to access resources managed by TG and accessible through OSG via a unified process and single mechanism.<br>
We will begin by planning a face-to-face Blueprint discussion about alloca-tions policy with a small group before Thanksgiving, 2009.  [fewer than 10 people, the following are suggested - Ralph Roskies, Richard Moore, John Towns, Dave Hart(SDSC), Kent Milfeld, …, Paul Avery, Kent Blackburn, Miron Livny, Ruth Pordes]<br>
<i>Phone meeting held on 10/21/09 with homework for TG to look at applications whose requests for allocation are not completely satisfied that might benefit from running on OSG. Homework for OSG to check with John McGee for Engage applications that were vectored to TG given their needs.</i>

Another meeting with representatives of TG’s Allocations Working Group and OSG’s registration and accounting areas will be held before the end of 2009. [Chander Sehgal, Kent Milfeld to organize]<br>
<i>Kent and Chander starting email discussion post Wed phone meeting above.</i>

4.    Explore how education, outreach, training, and external relations activities can be coordinated to maximize leverage and impact.<br>
A meeting will be held with TG Campus Champions Program Coordinator, Kay Hunt, Advanced User Support Area Director, Amit Majumdar, OSG En-gagement Area Coordinator, John McGee, and OSG Campus Grids Coordinator, Sebastien Goasguen to explore how our Campus Outreach activities can be coordinated to maximize leverage and impact.  [Scott Lathrop and Ruth Pordes to organize]<br>
<i>
Phone meeting held 10/16/09. Agreed that John McGee will attend Campus Champions phone meetings or find designees when he cannot attend. Minutes of last such meeting http://www.teragridforum.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=10/20/09   say:<br>
Collaboration with Open Science Grid:
 Planning meetings have been initiated with the OSG folks to determine the next steps.  Kay,
 Scott Lathrop, Ruth Pordes, John McGee met last Friday to discuss how the Champions and the
 OSG outreach folks might leverage their resources.
 A teleconference is being planned where John will present information on OSG and the opportunities
 there to the group.  We are looking for a date in November for the presentation.
</i>

OSG and TG’s External Relations teams will explore ways to collaboratively reach the scientific community, report science highlights, and facilitate access to information via the Internet. Targeted communication strategies to reach specific scientific domains and user groups will be explored. [Elizabeth Leake and David Ritchie]<br>
<i>Current discussions in context of iSGTW ongoing.</i>

5.    Work together to more effectively support the needs of research teams who rely on TG and OSG resources.<br>
Candidate research teams have been identified for which we will explore joint support for over the next six months. [Amit Majumdar, Dan Katz, John McGee, Ruth Pordes to coordinate]
<i>Engage SCEC work continuing.
Phone meeting about storage handling for earthquate engineering application on OSG (SCEC). 200 G has 17,000 files. Engage move a tar file and unpack but worry about integrity of all files staying in the data cache, and storing/retrieving this number of files through SRM takes a very long time. Agreed for ISI to test their Pegasus workflow which already runs SCEC workflows and moves the data automatically to an NSF shared file system  on the Nebraska Hadoop storage site. A single workflow has  been run successfully. </i>
