Ruth encouraged people to read and send questions if there are any.

Chander went to the TG management and allocation meetings as the the OSG representative, consistent with the shared principles document. Purpose was two fold, one to understand how they do business, and two let them know that OSG's interest continues to be strong. Still working on list of milestones and schedule. Working to understand their allocation and accounting systems. Hope to get the appropriate accounting people from both TG and OSG together in the future as a goal.

Dan reported on the HTPC (High Throughput Parallel Computing) (see link on page below to wiki page). Did a press release in the last OSG Newsletter. This is something between the OSG model and the TG model, addressing a class of small to modestly parallel jobs that need to submit lots of jobs. Awarded recently with 3 PIs on the proposal (Miron, John McGee and Dan Fraser). Oklahoma first to open doors for these types of jobs. Currently have a series of chemistry users that have 8-way parallel jobs that run for about 24 hours each. The trick is to find 8-way boxes to ship the MPI libraries to allow all the MPI communications to run on a single node. This addresses the portability of the jobs. Ran over 26,000 wall hours at Oklahoma. Sometimes running as many as 50 jobs running concurrently there. Horst Severini reported it is going well, but that Gracia thinks that most jobs fail due to an exit code, but they are working on this. Also been working with Purdue, San Diego and Nebraska Firefly system. In the future they will look into 4 to 64 way jobs. Currently working with friendly sites, lots of other sites are out there. Also interested in trying out different batch systems to deal with allocating a single node as opposed to a core.

---+++ Status Report from OSG Council Co-Chairs

   * Inputs to Annual DOE Written Report

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Paul has spoken to Alan Stone, our OSG DOE Program Officer about what he would like to see in the report. Alan has not yet looked in detail at the NSF report from this summer. We've gotten enough other feedback from DOE to indicate that we should provided more detail for HEP/NP in this report than was given in the NSF. CMS will probably have to make the biggest jump in the level of detail given in the report. More engagement details with OSG, technical issues, level of use, ... , more than general facts for the report. Paul should have forwarded to Michael for ATLAS and will do so. Historically we have turned in the report by December 31st. Paul talked to Alan Stone and he thinks as long as we get it in 3 months before the start of new funding (April 1st for 2010), that would be good enough, but Paul would like to push ahead with the schedule of having this in by Dec 31st. He has asked for inputs by Saturday of this week. Chander is collecting from the area coordinators.

Action Item 4 was addressed by Dan Fraser's dicussion of HTPC. These are one in the same and Dan will keep the council updated on this. Previously know as the "adopt a cluster" proposal. This has been awarded and is being used (as FTE effort to work on this). Been working on this for about a month. 

Action Item 5 regarding virtual machines: Doug commented that there have been emails circulated regarding the DOE Cloud Computing effort (Magellan). STAR is already talking and SBGRID has expressed interest. Question: Is there someone in OSG that wants to coordinate this and express interest with the Magellan Project. Suggested that an email regarding this be sent to Jerome and Sebastien and cc the council to solicit interest.

   * Report from Collective VO Representatives
   * Ongoing Goals/Milestones 
   * Planning for the Future

%BLUE% *minutes:*

Shaowen & Tom (Collective VO): Tom, Shaowen, Kent and Paul held a meeting earlier this week to organize ways to work with the collective VOs. One strategy is to hold a session at the All-Hands-Meeting to gather inputs from the VOs. Couple of things worth highlighting: group focusing on usability of the OSG, soliciting inputs from VOs; also effort to gather inputs from VOs for end-to-end information systems, along with workflow tools are used and what are the plans for VOs in the future. These will need some attention from Tom and Shaowen. NYState Grid is now part of this high performance portal in the State of New York.

Michael Ernst (ATLAS): Exciting times, single and collision beams, stable beam conditions until Christmas, beam lifetime on the order of 25 hours, expect to take one million collision events before Christmas, data replicated one hour after data taking, at T1s and after that at the T2s, analysis activities focusing on reconstruction, continue to see more and more people interested in the data, about 30 people looking at the data and growing, T3s are ramping up with collaboration coordinators and Condor Team coordinated by Dan Fraser to work on packaging issues to reduce effort needed to configure and deploy and has been valuable and successful at getting to a model that can be deployed by T3 administrators, working on architecture and one concern is the GT2 element, in Europe there is noticable effort looking into CREME developed by EGEE in Italy, BNL has a workshop going on now to look at this which included Condor Team, US ATLAS may in the future make a request to OSG to officially support the CREME package, all infrastructure components under the OSG umbrella have worked very well, issuing purchase orders for significant resource increases, T2s ramping up to 1Petabyte.
