---+++ Council Members Round Table Reports
   * US CMS, - Ken - Global glideinwms deployment is going well in that the vast bulk of jobs are now going through that way.
   * AAA Satellite - Ken - The great bulk of CMS T2 sites are now in the data federation, so that > 90% of datasets are available that way.  We've shown that the redirector can redirect at 10 Hz  which is OK for steady state operations (maybe not so good if a zillion jobs start at once).  We're now starting to look at the limitations of actually trying to move some data around from multiple sites. 
   * Glue-X - Richard Jones - Next data challenge - like the one at the end of 2012 -  will take place later on this Fall. 
   * Alice/NERSC - Jeff Porter -  I  note the good work of OSG staff - particularly John Weigand - for quickly resolving an issue we had with accounting records sent to WLCG from our NERSC site.   There were actually two problems, one local and one in MyOSG, in need of attention which caused us to initially report 0 cputime delivered for the month of August and part of September.  The sources of the problems were found and the records in gratia and WLCG were corrected.   The whole episode was resolved very efficiently.  I'll note it in my next quarterly report to DOE/NP. The only other small items from ALICE that may be of interest: 
      * ALICE moving away from aliTorrent to cvmfs for software deployment.  Goal is by end of this CY. It's installed on PDSF and will be on LLNL/LC.  
      * ALICE-US is starting to participate with the Big PanDA effort via one of our collaborators with OLCF from ORNL/U.Tenn and myself.  No real commitment yet beyond what the two of us can offer, but ALICE team has expressed some interest. 
      * Finally, I see Richard will be running a new data challenge.  We'll make sure our LLNL site is available.
