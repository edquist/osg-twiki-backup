In January 2013, the usage was approximately 2.2M hours (not counting the 0.5M hours used by CSIU which represents an OSG user at the Indiana University School of Medicine).  We have been advised by the chair of the XSEDE Resource Allocation Committee (XRAC) that there are requests for 10M-20M hours pending against OSG at the March 11 meeting; historically OSG has made 2M hours available each quarter.
