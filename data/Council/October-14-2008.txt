---++ Agenda/Minutes

---+++ Status Report from the OSG Executive Director

Below is the Executive Director's report from Ruth, dated Oct. 13.

_The OSG presence at the LHC Grid Fest seemed to go well. We had interested visitors to our table; the RENCI vizualization of non-physics jobs being submitted, matched, executed and completed on OSG was a great hit both at CERN and in the USA. The Wisdom (drug discovery) table next to ours showed jobs running on OSG and EGEE. John McGee and I had useful conversations with Ed Seidel (NSF) and Glen Crawford (DOE) and we hope something useful comes out of it. <br /> <br />The SBGrid Task Force has made progress with all SBGrid resources now being "green" and finally having daily functional test results that sometimes show 100%. The next steps are to maintain availability and reliability to be >80% for a week; and then be 90% for a month before December. Work is also continuing in the Engagement area on helping the SBGrid run their first applications over multiple OSG sites. <br /> <br />There will be a site administrators workshop at SLAC November 12th and 13th. We encourage all - especially new - site administrators to attend. [[SiteCoordination.SiteAdminsWorkshop2008][https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SiteCoordination/SiteAdminsWorkshop2008]] <br /> <br />We are starting small with an effort to deploy distributed accounting repositories and to encourage site administrators and users to pay attention to the daily reports - and especially note anomalies. We are collecting a lot of data - we need to make sure it is useful. We are also going back to validate information about opportunistic use now the registration database has more accurate information about ownership of resources, and supports a particular resource to be owned by multiple organizations._

---+++ Status Report from the OSG Project Manager

[[%ATTACHURL%/OSG_PJM_Report_14Oct08.ppt][OSG_PjM_Report_14Oct08.ppt]]

Chander presented a short report on project management, including Year 2 WBS, the Year 3 SOWs being prepared and the Year 3 WBS which is now stored in the OSG Doc-db area. We still do not have a date for the NSF/DOE review (Joint Oversight Team or JOT), although we expect it be sometime in the January/February time frame. Once the date is set we expect to have a charge to prepare for. We are still transitioning to the new OSG Organization plan presented at the August Council meeting.

The JOT recently expressed a concern about the LHC/LIGO focus of OSG and wants the consortium to focus more on the smaller VOs. We are in fact supporting the "at-large" VO activity (non-LHC, non-LIGO), coordinated by Abhishek Rana and Britta Daudert. The at-large VO activity is organized around specific projects, recently including helping SBGrid get online and successfully providing storage to dramatically improve D0's job efficiency.

??Will put more here later??
---+++ Reports from Gridfest

Ruth reported above about GridFest. Ed Seidel of NSF and Glenn Crawford of DOE spoke from CERN, while a number of us, as well as our agency friends Kevin Thompson of NSF, Don Petravick of DOE, Susan Turnbull of DOE and Steve Cotter of ESNet, attended the event at Fermilab several hours later. Andrew Schultz, an assistant professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, SUNY at Buffalo, presented an interesting talk about his few-molecule chemical simulations that have used up tens of thousands of hours of CPU time.

---+++ Notice of Value Proposition Model for OSG Under Development

Paul and Chander summarized the work that James Weichel, a consultant hired for this purpose, has carried out to quantify the value (in monetary terms) of OSG's work. He has written a couple of drafts of a document containing some early figures. Paul, Kent and Chander have all spent time with James to improve the document. We hope that something can be presented at one of our Executive Team or Council meetings in the near future.

---+++ Planning for next SAG Interaction

??Will summarize this later??

---+++ Delay in LHC: Status and Implications to OSG

The recent delays of LHC turn-on have probably reduced the impact of CMS and ATLAS computing on OSG over what it might have been with data to study over the CERN winter shutdown. This presents an opportunity for other VOs to take advantage of OSG computing, especially if they have made plans under the assumption that these resources would be heavily used by CMS and ATLAS. Chander reported that the Einstein@Home application is being made more robust so that it will run at more sites, but currently it is limited to only a few.
