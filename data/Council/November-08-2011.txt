---+++ Status Report from the OSG Executive Director, OSG Project Manager and/or Others

   * Usage on OSG has decreased over the last couple of months. Still working with the production management and user support to better understand any underlying reasons. 
   * OSG as an XSEDE SP - agreement to have OSG listed as a resource that can be requested by XSEDE allocation requests in mid-Dec. This means some web pages documentation before that date. Any allocations granted will be ready to submit in April 2012. Work is proceeding to understand all the tasks we need to complete before then (campus grid installation/submission; authentication/authorization; submit mode recommendations; accounting and reporting etc. I have asked Chander for a project plan/list of items.)
   * OSG CA - any comments/questions on the mail send on Monday. 
   * WLCG  TEG have started. There are several working meetings at CERN over the next couple of months.
   * CERN proposal to EU for work in data preservation/open access reaching out for collaboration between EU and US both to the labs and the NSF. What this all means is still far from clear. (They need to get funded first)
   * No news on the OSG proposal except that it is expected to be reviewed "soon".

   * September Council Action item: Ruth - will revise charter to include services and present to council at Oct teleconf.
      * Existing OSG Charter - http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/RetrieveFile?docid=25&extension=doc
      * Does it in practice need changing?

---+++ iSGTW Name Change Suggestions (Ruth or Miriam)

As you know the name of iSGTW was going to be changed at the beginning of this year and then we ran into copyright/trademark issues. The topic is now on the table again in the ISGTW Board meeting which includes EGI, CERN, Taiwan/ASGC, OSG and Fermilab. The name will be chosen by "vote". This is the "last ditch effort" to talk about a name change. If it does not happen this time we will drop the topic from consideration. 

Katie Yurkewicz, Paul Avery, Ruth and Miriam have votes.

   * Top contenders:
      * The Analytical Engine
      * Ada Lovelace Magazine
      * The punch card
