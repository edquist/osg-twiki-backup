---+++ iSGTW Name Change Suggestions (Ruth or Miriam)

As you know the name of iSGTW was going to be changed at the beginning of this year and then we ran into copyright/trademark issues. The topic is now on the table again in the ISGTW Board meeting which includes EGI, CERN, Taiwan/ASGC, OSG and Fermilab. The name will be chosen by "vote". This is the "last ditch effort" to talk about a name change. If it does not happen this time we will drop the topic from consideration. 

Katie Yurkewicz, Paul Avery, Ruth and Miriam have votes.

   * Top contenders:
      * The Analytical Engine
      * Ada Lovelace Magazine
