The OSG Council is the governing body of the Consortium responsible for the program of work and ensuring effective benefit to the scientific mission of the stakeholders. The Consortium includes all contributors to OSG; the Council is made of those Consortium members making significant contributions and commitments to the success of OSG. It makes and endorses all strategic decisions, which are typically discussed first in and recommended by the Executive Board.

---+++ OSG Science Advisory Group


The Scientific Advisory Group consisting of leading scientists provides guidance to Council and Executive Board. The Scientific Advisory Group reviews the effectiveness of the benefits of OSG to the scientific mission of the stakeholders and provides feedback on the program of work to achieve this. Members of the Scientific Advisory Group are appointed by the Council Chair and confirmed by the Council. 

The SAG does not have face-to-face meetings. Discussions will be transacted by email and phone, with each member having a specific OSG contact with whom to work on more of the details.  As of 11/12/09 the following invitations to contribute to the OSG Science Advisory Group have been accepted:

   * High Energy Physics: Marjorie Shapiro (ATLAS and CDF, LBNL)
   * Nuclear Physics: Thomas Ullrich (STAR analysis)
   * Computer science: Jack Dongarra http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/
   * Biology and biomedicine: - Gaudenz Danuser - image processing: http://lccb.hms.harvard.edu/; 
   * Biology and biomedicine: Zac Kohane: http://www.childrenshospital.org/cfapps/research/data_admin/Site113/mainpageS113P0.html
   * Fusion - Bill Tang, PPPL, http://w3.pppl.gov/theory/tang.html

The currently proposed contacts are:

   * High Energy Physics: Rick Snider?
   * Nuclear Physics: Kent Blackburn?
   * Computer science: Miron L
   * Biology and biomedicine: Piotr S
   * Fusion: Paul A

The ScienceAdvisoryGroupPage gives links to information given to the members of the group.

The next steps before the end of the year are to send them the Introduction to OSG, the NSF Annual Report and a sample of current metrics. Then there will be a  phone meeting to discuss one or two items of interest. Attendees to be the PI, Executive Direction and Council Co-Chairs.
