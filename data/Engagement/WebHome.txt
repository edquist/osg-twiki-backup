---++ Mission and goals

The OSG's user engagement activity has two fundamental objectives: 
   1. to bring the power of the OSG infrastructure to scientists and educators beyond the high energy physics domain; 
   1. and to use these experiences with new users and domains to drive new requirements for the natural evolution of the OSG infrastructure.

---++ Current initiatives
We are currently working with fifteen users at various stages within the engagement process.  These include researchers in fields ranging from genetics to library science to earthquake simulation to video processing to physics (and beyond). We are actively recruiting new users via structured programs such as [[http://cidays.org/index.php?title=Main_Page][CI Days]], and continually through informal social
networking by the engagement staff and the entire OSG organization.

---++ Challenges and Successes
One of the biggest challenges to user engagement is getting the initial contact with potential users, catching them at the right time within their cycle to ignite an engagement, and developing the trust and relationships necessary to drive lasting changes in their working methodologies.

A handful of the user engagements have proven to be very successful, and have resulted or will result in Research Highlights, and in OSG citations in peer reviewed literature.  For example:
   * [[http:/www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000219][Grids work like a CHARMM for molecular dynamics]]
   * [[http:/www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000207][Keeping up with Moore's Law]]
   * [[http:/www.opensciencegrid.org/?pid=1000201][Designing proteins from scratch]]

---++ Do you have an application to run on OSG? 
If you have an application that you would like to run on OSG, please <a href="mailto:osg@renci.org">contact us</a> to discuss your application requirements, we welcome opportunities to work with new research application teams.

[[http://www.renci.org/~rynge/osg/Engage_New_User_Guide.pdf][New user guide for Engagement]]  describes what the process looks like for running your jobs on OSG using via the Engagement team.

See the <a href="http://www.renci.org/~rynge/osg/status.php" target="_blank">current status of jobs from the Engagement VO</a>.
