---++ Welcome to OSG Engagement
 <br /> The OSG's user engagement activity has two fundamental objectives: to bring the power of the OSG infrastructure to scientists and educators beyond the high energy physics domain; and to use these experiences with new users and domains to drive new requirements for the natural evolution of the OSG infrastructure.

The Engagement team works closely with these communities over periods of several months to help them derive this benefit. These activities include:

   * providing an understanding of how to use the distributed infrastructure; 
   * adapting applications to run effectively on OSG sites; 
   * engaging in the deployment of community owned distributed infrastructures; 
   * working with the OSG Facility to ensure the needs of the new community are met; 
   * providing common tools and services in support of the engagement communities; 
   * and working directly with and in support of the new end users with the goal to have them transition to be full contributing members of the OSG. 

OSG Engagement Provides:

   * an established a Virtual Organization Management Service (VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoMS) for the Engage VO 
   * monitoring of the OSG sites with aim to increase the amount of opportunistically available resources. 
   * use of the common Grid Exerciser and other customizable VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo tests to probe the applicability and availability of sites to running engagement applications. 
   * alliance with OSG operations and troubleshooting activities to work with Engage sites to fix any problems found. 
   * use of the common resource selection and matchmaking services on OSG to improve the success rate in scheduling jobs to run on particular sites.
