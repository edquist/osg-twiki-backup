---++ Introduction

%TOC%

During the  [[EngageOpenSeesB][proof-of-principle phase of integration of NEES with OSG]], the OSG User Support team has worked with NEES to enable a proof-of-principle of direct job submission as well as of portal-based job submission.

For the case of direct job subssion, NEES ran 300 !OpenSEES jobs for an estimated 2400 hours to analyze the response of a structure called the Self-Centering Steel Plate Shear Wall (SC-SPSW) system.

The OSG User Support team is now helping NEES scale up with workload on OSG by about 2 orders of magnitude. This activity is considered a demo of production computations for NEES.
