!+++- LSST Image Simulation on OSG

+++-- Introduction

This !Twiki area is the knowledge repository for describing the infrastructure and operation of the LSST image simulation on the Open Science Grid. From here, you will be able to obtain details of the setup, how to build and distribute the LSST image simulation software, and how to run image simulations on OSG.

+++-- Architecture Overview

Leveraging the Open Science Grid for LSST image simulations is done with the aid of the OSM Match-Maker, or OSGMM. This an application for use in conjunction with a standard OSG client installation to handle submission of grid jobs with automatic match-making and execution across multiple sites. It is also capable of identifying which sites support the Virtual Organization and performing regular verification and maintenance tasks, such as attribute / feature discovery and software installation. 

Scripts have been developed to build and package the LSST image simulation software; to install the software on a site; to submit the jobs to simulate an image; and a wrapper to find and execute the simulation on a remote node.
