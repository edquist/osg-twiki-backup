[[http://opensees.berkeley.edu/OpenSees/home/about.php][OpenSees]] is a program that
can simulate the response of buildings and other structures to earthquakes. It can require
a lot of computation time, so it is useful to run multiple instances of it at the same time on the grid.
This page describes a prototype integration of the OpenSees workflow of one user, but
it is hoped that the work, with some changes, will be more generally applicable.
