I gave up on Scientific Linux 4.1 -- too unstable.
This is a Scientific Linux 3.0.3 distribution.

yum install bridge-utils
I packaged Twisted-1.3.0 (apparently somewhere between there and 2.1.0, the naming conventions have changed) with
SRPMs and RPMS.  I'll link those in later.

I packaged python-logging from http://www.red-dove.com as well, since the logging modules are included in python 2.3 
and only python 2.2 is included with SL 3.  (Xen docs are incorrect on this point -- they state python 2.2+ is the
requirement).

After a bit of hacking around, I realized that Xen wasn't booting because the prebuilt Xen kernels lacked the 3ware raid driver (3w-xxxx).  
I downloaded the source, ran make menucnofig, and included them in the monolithic image.  I also did a 'make xen' and a 'make tools'; xend start
complained about a Python C API version mismatch otherwise.

Ok, xen is now installed!  Try out: cms-xen1.fnal.gov
