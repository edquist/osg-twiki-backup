This is a Scientific Linux 4.1 distribution.

bridge-utils was not installed.  yum install bridge-utils also brought along sysfsutils.
In order to build twisted, I needed !ZopeInterface.  I created SRPMS and binary packages for both.
!ZopeInterface-3.0.1-0.src.rpm twisted-2.1.0.src.rpm will be linked in later.
