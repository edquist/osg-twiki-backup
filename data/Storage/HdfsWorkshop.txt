      * Help folks install small evaluation testbeds.
      * Get all the important components going (HDFS, FUSE, GridFTP, SRM)
      * Demonstrate file transfers and CMSSW usage
   * Outline how the transition process at Nebraska proceeded.
      * Discuss what tests your SE must pass and how to set them up with Hadoop.
   * Demonstrate reliability of hdfs in various circumstances:
      * restart of namenode
      * restoration from checkpoint/backup
      * client behavior during namenode restart
      * log atomicity during namenode failure (=kill -9=)
   * Finish Rocks5 integration
      * configure rack-awareness at install time
      * configure ganglia at install time
      * build hadoop rpm from source
      * integration bestman/gridftp
   * test scalability
   * plan a "storage challenge" to be held before data taking?
   * develop suitable installation/management documentation (for the VDT?)
