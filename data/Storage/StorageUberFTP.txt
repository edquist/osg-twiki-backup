---++Overview
!UberFTP is an interactive !GridFTP enabled client. According to [[http://dims.ncsa.uiuc.edu/set/uberftp/index.html][official website]], it is the first interactive, !GridFTP enabled ftp client. It supports GSI authentication, parallel data channels and third party transfers.

---++Preparation
!UberFTP is packaged in to VDT as one of the [[Documentation.StorageGridFTP][GridFTP]]-enabled clients and should be available on any node that has the VDT CE or WN software installed. 
To run the client, you need to 
   * login to proper node
   * source [VDT-INSTALL]/setup.sh
   * make sure you have client in your [PATH] by running following command
<pre class="screen">
which uberftp
</pre>

---+++Normal Transfers
In normal data transfers, the "local" machine is the one on which you are running the command. 
   * Use =open= to select the remote host
   * Perform =put= and =get= between the local client machine and the remote FTP service

---+++Third-Party Transfers
Third-party transfers are performed similarly to other file transfers.In order to perform a third-party transfer:
   * Select a new "local" service by using =lopen=. Now all 'l*' commands perform actions on the new 'local' service as if you were logged into that machine
   * Use =put= to perform a third-party transfer when moving the file from "local" service to the "remote" service" 
   * Use =get= to perform a third-party transfer when moving the file from "remote" service to the "local" service"
   * Use =close= and =lclose= when you are finished with the "remote" and "local" service respectively

---+++GSI Authenticated Session
   * Obtain a grid proxy using =grid-proxy-init=
   * Use !UberFTP to access the remote server
   * Run your commands
   * Close the connection
   
Here's an example of starting a session using GSI authentication: 
<pre class="screen">

 Sept 23 2003  The certificate for MSS has been renewed using NCSA's CA
               certificate. To continue using GSI authentication to MSS,
               please get a copy of NCSA's CA certificate
               (4a6cd8b1.0 and 4a6cd8b1.signing_policy) from
               ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/aces/ncsa-ca/certificates and place them
               in /etc/grid-security/certificates on your client machine.

---+++Third-party transfer with five data connections
   1. Run !UberFTP
   2. =open= the site you will use as the "remote" service.
   3. =lopen= the site that you wish to use as the "local" service.
   4. =get= the file to transfer it from the "remote" service to the server you designated as a "local" service.

Here's an example of a third-party transfer with five data connections:
