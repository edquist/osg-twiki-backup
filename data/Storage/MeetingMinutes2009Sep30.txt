Ted:
<pre class="screen">
Moved SCEC support forward by encouraging UFL to fix their GIP configuration. 
Though the GIP team will not offer support for their non-hep compute element due to extensive customization, 
YuJun Wu is working on this. So, kudos.

Made and tested several gPlazma patches for dCache 1.9.5 "Golden" release. Instead of returning only the 
authorizations, gPlazma now returns a map of all roles found and their authorizations, including "null" if 
the role is not authorized. Solved a problem of unexpected results when multiple roles mapped to the 
same authorization.

* Support
  - srm-copy usage for a large file/directory transfer
  - srm-ping and srm-copy usage in RSV probe

* bestman 2.2.1.3 release
   - packaging, testing

* next major release as bestman2 will be towards the end of this year.
   bestman2  uses tomcat for the http container and the latest
gridftp/gsi libraries.
   current bestman will be maintained for a while as bestman1
   until all sites move to bestman2, but all new features will only be
added to the bestman2.

* bestman new features in 2.2.1.3

1. VOMS validation is supported
   conf entry: validateVomsProxy=true  (false by default)
   With or without gums support in the server, it validates the voms proxy.
2. user space keys are supported
   userSpaceKeywords is to define keys to shorten the path
   format: userSpaceKeywords=(key1=/path1)(key2=/path2)
   e.g.: userSpaceKeywords=(tic=/user/tic)(tac=/proj/tac)
   bestman will disable space management when this is defined
   and SFN=/tic/fpath1 in SURL will be translated to SFN=/user/tic/fpath1
   difference from staticTokens: space descriptions are not supported.
3. checksum callout is supported
   this is effective only if showChecksumWhenListingFile=true
   conf entry: hexChecksumCommand
   e.g. hecChecksumCommand=/usr/local/bin/mychecksum -adler32
   When a file needs checksum, the file path is attached to the call-out
command,
   and the returns can be seperated by spaces, and
   the first value is assumed to be the checksum value output.
4. No directory browsing is supported as a server side enforcement.
   conf entry: NoDirBrowsing=true
   It will handle srmLs on all directory level browsing with level 0
requests,
   returning the directory information only.

* bestman changes in 2.2.1.3

5. (full mode) fixed wrong space token generation after restarting the
server
6. (full mode) fixed wrong status code return in srmCopy
7. (full mode) fixed truncated directory browsing for a long path name

* setup changes and new options in 2.2.1.3
1. all command line scripts support dash environment on Ubuntu
2. added --with-container-threads=<int> for web service container threads
   defaults to 64 per 512MB max java heap size
3. added --enable-voms-validation
4. added --with-user-space-key=<string> for user space keys
   format: (key1=/path2)(key2=/path2)
5. added --enable-voms-validation
6. added --with-checksum-callout=<PATH> to specify path for checksum
callout command
7. added configure.gateway and configure.fullmode
   conf/bestman.rc will be customized and simplied for each mode.

* srm clients lbnl - new features in 2.2.1.3
1. added clear status tags (request or file) for returned status information
2. added "-connectiontimeout <seconds>" in srm-copy for soap or gsi
connection
   timeout as well as file transfer timeout.

        Reviewed Andrew's proposal, provided feedback

---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

Andrew's troubleshooting/log collection design doc - any feedback?
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Brian has questioned  the viability of our decision to look into log collection/troubleshooting. He thought  that  the similar attempts have failed before (e.g. he has mentioned about apparent reluctance of sys admins to install syslog-ng for log collection). Tanya reminded that we have the following item in our WBS for FY10:

"Investigate tools for storage troubleshooting"

Brian agreed that this activity seems to be relevant to WBS and asked Andrew to add more implementation  details into the document.  Tanya asked to add real use cases to the document, e.g example how logs and relevant filtering rules could help troubleshooting. Andrew said that he would need help with that.
  

---++ Second Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Storage discovery tools - how far we from VDT release? 

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Ted started working on improving caching. He will contact STG to report the progress and discuss packaging. Tanya suggested to provide configuration script that would allow to configure discovery tools to access OSG or ITB bdii.



---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Progress with SCEC (Ted)

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

Mats loaded tar files to Caltech, Nebraska and Firefly. Now, he will need to untar them and run jobs. UFlorida is still working on GIP configuration.

---++ Fourth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
New Bestman release and plans for the next major release (Alex)
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

New BeStMan is released and ready for testing (see status report). BeStMan2 work has started.

---++ Filth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Hadoop, space tokens & space utilization plugin

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Plugin is needed to report space usage for static tokens (lcg-cp failed if this information is not available). Brian said that there is a way to set quota on hadoop fs and use hadoop command to report space utilization.
Andrew will try to set quotas on our local test stand and write plugin for BeStMan.
---++ Sixth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
RSV Storage Probes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

Arvind has requested that OSG Storage takes responsibilities over RSV Storage Probes. We will need to talk to Alain and understand if this is a reasonable request for us before making any decision.
