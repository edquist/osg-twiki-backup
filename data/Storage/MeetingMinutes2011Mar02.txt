- RSV storage probes: SRM_CONFIG still an issue at BNL.  Have created several debug probes for him to test.  Issue still pending
- Public Storage: Accessing gratia still a roadblock.  Emailed Phillip but no response.  Will ping again.
- Hadoop test stand: bestman-hadoop was slow but functional.  bestman2 had an issue with contacting GUMs.

Hadoop RPMs:
- I've begun testing hadoop 0.20 rpms  So far I have tested hadoop and hadoop-fuse.  I still have to test bestman and gridftp.  
On Frank's request, as soon as I finish on my test setup I'll give Haifeng the go-ahead to do more detailed performance 
      testing on a larger scale for Brian
- The hadoop 0.20 rpm in I linked in last week's report needed to be rebuilt and can be now found at:
http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/2.0/rhel5/x86_64/osg-hadoop-20-2.el5.noarch.rpm
The previous instructions I gave to enable it were not enough.  To correctly enable the new repo test branch, after 
installing this rpm you must edit /etc/yum.repos.d/osg-hadoop.repo, change enabled=0 for the stable [hadoop] branch and 
change enabled=1 for the [hadoop-testing] branch. 
 I also recommend running "yum clean all" in case a previous release of hadoop repo has been installed on the machine to clear the rpm cache.
