Hadoop testing 0.19 -> 0.20 upgrade
- successfully upgraded but encountered minor issues that should be easily fixed:
- if yum removes hadoop rpm from 0.19 after installing 0.20, it removes symlinks needed for 0.20:
          /usr/bin/hadoop
          /etc/hadoop
- upgrade instructions say to use /usr/bin/hadoop-daemon but this is a symlink and fails unless you envoke it with real path:
       /usr/lib/hadoop-0.20/bin/hadoop-daemon.sh
- hadoop namenode data directories needs ownership change since daemons can no longer be started by root
- fetch-crl / osg-ca-certs didn't get upgraded with new rpms
Hadoop repository updates:
- rebuilt repo initialization rpms to include osg-ca-certs repository:
      http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/1.0/rhel5/x86_64/osg-hadoop-1-3.el5.noarch.rpm (for 0.19)
      http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/testing/2.0/rhel5//x86_64/osg-hadoop-20-3.el5.noarch.rpm (for 0.20)
Hadoop 0.20 Documentation:
- reviewed Tanya and Neha's comments, will update this week
- 6/8 - 6/15

Hadoop 0.20 repo
- Currently testing the transition between 0.19 and 0.20 and verifying instructions here:
          https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/HadoopUpgrade

Documentation
- completed first draft of https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Hadoop20
- will continue to revise as needed
