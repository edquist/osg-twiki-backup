Ted:
<pre class="screen">
Worked on Public Storage process/requirements document. 
Finished first version of wrapper script to run Pigeon tool and write some of the iCAT
metadata. 
It remains to write the complete metadata and provide a hook to the iRODS client installation. 
Started work on Public Storage tool for the production coordinator to register sites. Looking at additions
to the discovery tool to support that. 
Changed discovery tool to require Java 1.6, since that is now included in VDT. 
The tool for some reason ran more slowly in 1.5 as compared to 1.6. 
Designed a web service interface to tie together the components of public storage and provide direct access from clients. 
Started work on Storage Forum presentations.
