---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
SCEC
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
UofFlorida is ready for SCEC. Mats has verfied Engage authorization. Ted will contact Gaurang in a few week to get update.

---++ Second Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Storage and transfer gratia probes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

Andrew is ready to start modification for dcache transfer probes but we didn't get the real requirements from Gratia team. Brian will contact Phillipe to come up with formal requirements. Until that we will not start any development

Released probe:
CMS T1 has stopped reporting transfers to gratia. They didn't have a chance to install new one. Plan to do so as soon as they fix all problems related to power outage.

ALGT2 installed new probes. The new storage probes chronicle looks good, it provides information about total and used space, changes during last week, as well as statistic on link groups and pools.
