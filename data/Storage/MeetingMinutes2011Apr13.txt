Hadoop 0.20 testing:
- no progress, waiting for Brian to respond to hadoop / fuse failure issues

Hadoop 0.20 documentation:
- Put https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/Hadoop20Installation
under content management, began formatting to make it conform to the installation template

Hadoop VDT repository:
- Improved on cron script that calls hourly mash updates to prevent log files from growing indefinitely.

Other:
- assisted Terrence in testing bestman2 2.0.5 from 0.19 Production Hadoop RPM repository.  The test instance works so far and we will likely be upgrading the UCSD srm to use this version.
