---++ FAQs

*dCache*

%RED%Q1%ENDCOLOR%: Can I use dccp to copy files in the reserved area?

<font color="royalblue">A1</font>: Not at present. Developers are working on it.

%RED%Q2%ENDCOLOR%: Is there a command line tool available for reading a file stored on dCache or concatenating individual files stored on dCache?

<font color="royalblue">A2</font>: No. In order to perform file operations (reading, concatenating, etc), you must copy files locally, manipulate/use them and copy them back to storage location.

%RED%Q3%ENDCOLOR%: Can I find out pool name for a file using dCap?

<font color="royalblue">A3</font>: No. There is no way to find out pool name on client side.

%RED%Q4%ENDCOLOR%: How do I clean up files belonging to non-existent pools?

<font color="royalblue">A4</font>: Recommended way is to clean out all the replicas from the companion DB via postgres, then run "pnfs register" on each pool via the admin interface.

%RED%Q5%ENDCOLOR%: I accidently deleted the parent directory, how can I change the parent id of files in PNFS?

<font color="royalblue">A5</font>: Send an email to osg-storage@opensciencgrid.org to get the solution. It is not posted here because of its critical nature.

%RED%Q6%ENDCOLOR%: Can I create softlinks on srm server as a normal user?

<font color="royalblue">A6</font>: No. Only Storage Element Admin can do so.

%RED%Q7%ENDCOLOR%: How can I install Fermi srmclient package?

<font color="royalblue">A7</font>: Use the "pacman -get OSG:client" command.

%RED%Q8%ENDCOLOR%: As a SE Admin, how can I set up group access on a storage location?

<font color="royalblue">A8</font>: This can be obtained by having a few users belong to a special group/role within your VO and then using standard unix like permissions

on the storage locations in question for the user to which this VO/group/role gets mapped to.

%RED%Q9%ENDCOLOR%:What happens to data stored under an expired space reservation?

<font color="royalblue">A9</font>: At present, nothing UNLESS you explicitly run a space cleaner tool which cleanups expired space reservations. 

%RED%Q10%ENDCOLOR%: Do pool nodes need host certificates? Why?

<font color="royalblue">A10</font>: Yes. Credentials are delegated to pools so that they can act as clients when receiving data in pull mode or delivering <br />data in push mode. See slides 14 and 16 of https://srm.fnal.gov/twiki/pub/SrmProject/SrmPresentations/SRMDesign.pdf. Therefore in these cases they <br />need host certificates.

%RED%Q11%ENDCOLOR%: Gridftp doors are returning private ip address to SRM server. Why?

<font color="royalblue">A11</font>:
