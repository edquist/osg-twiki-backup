<font color="red">What is Space Reservation?</font>
<pre>
Space reservation is a promise by the storage system to make certain amount of storage space of certain type available for usage for a specified period of time. 
</pre>

<font color="red">How does it work?</font>
<pre>Space reservation is made using srmReserveSpace function. In case of successful reservation, a unique name, called space token is assigned to the 
reservation. Space token can be used during the transfer operations to tell the system to put the files being manipulated or transferred into an associated 
space reservation . A storage system ensures that the reserved amount of the disk space is indeed available, thus providing a guarantee that a client does 
not run out of space until all space promised by the reservation has been used. When files are deleted, the space is returned to the space reservation.
