%TOC%

This is an internal page for Doug Strain to keep track of what he is doing:

---++ Remaining Tasks for Version 3 Release:

   * Java dependencies: make list %GREEN% done %ENDCOLOR%
   * Hadoop: Transition information from Jeff Dost
      * Make sure I can build Hadoop RPMs and have basic understanding of spec file
      * Run through Hadoop documentation and make sure I can do an install with latest RPMs  %GREEN%Done%ENDCOLOR%
   * Packaging
      * pigeon tools (medium -> low priority)
      * !BeStMan release: not until first week of December (early 2012)
   * Documentation
      * Finish merging and updating Hadoop documentation %GREEN%Done%ENDCOLOR%
      * Gratia probes documentation %YELLOW%done except for dcache%ENDCOLOR%
      * SRM Tester %GREEN%done%ENDCOLOR%
      * RSV probes documentation [%GREEN% Done %ENDCOLOR%]
      * Upgrade procedure: Pacman -> ??? Magic ??? -> RPMs! (worry about after software first)
         * Important, but requires testing and figuring a procedure
   * Testing 
      * RSV: Storage probes and pigeon %GREEN% Tested %ENDCOLOR%
      * Gratia probes:
         * Hadoop: storage and transfer probes %YELLOW%Jeff tested%ENDCOLOR%
         * Xrootd: storage and transfer probes %GREEN%tested%ENDCOLOR%
         * dCache: storage and transfer probes (low priority)
         * Gridftp transfer probe %GREEN%tested%ENDCOLOR%
      * Test more complicated xrootd installations? (low priority)
      * Test Hadoop to verify new RPMs %GREEN%tested%ENDCOLOR%
      * Figure out pre-release testing procedure and possibly re-install test stand
   * Open tickets: about 8-10 (most covered above)
      * Verify globus-gridftp-server rotates its logfiles %GREEN%Done%ENDCOLOR%
      * Fix Bestman Build Date
      * Eliminate dependencies in OSG Discovery Tools and Bestman (super low priority)

---++ Open Questions:
   * Who is taking over !BeStMan? probably Neha (Alain. 10/24/2011)
   * Are we maintaining dCache Transfer & Storage probes? For now, stays unchanged (Alain. 10/24/2011)
      * Update from Tanya: these are needed and our responsibility.
   * What to do about test stand???? (Should this be the !BeStMan development team responsibility?  -> Neha)
      * dCache test stand continues existence: but we don't do much until 2012.
      * Keep for dCache gratia probe support
   * What testing procedures should continue?  (see below)
       * Testing procedure should be revised in 2012
       * Goal: get testing stand in order for December !BeStMan release
       * For now, make sure Tanya validation scripts are copied and put in svn software repo

   * (minor technical issue) xrootd multi-lib?  pulls in wrong dependencies on x84_64 (Talk to Matyas + Brian)


Hadoop
   * How should we migrate Hadoop Storage Reports? Hadoop storage report not migrated, assumes gratia collector. This needs investigation (Brian orphan)
      * Answer: Alain will email Jeff & Brian (propose dropping this)
      * Query locally? 
   * How about direct procedure for 0.19 -> 0.20 osg? 
   * Look at JMX Monitoring for Bestman Documentation
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/HadoopMonitoring

---++ Testing framework

The following serves as internal notes to remind me of the existing test infrastructure and aid in determining the form of future testing effort.
It is still in very rough format.

Current test frameworks:
   * Validation testing by Tanya (using static test stand)
   * Stress testing by Haifeng Pi
   * Java based web framework done by Neha
   * RSV / pigeon probes by Doug

Current testing matrix (from validation tests):
   * bestman2_gateway_disk
   * bestman2_gateway_hadoop
   * bestman2_gateway_xrootd
   * bestman_fullmode (drop?) [space reservation]
   * xrootd with 2 clusters and "global" redirector with FRM
   * dCache (only used to test third-party transfer)

Each one should be tested:
   * With static tokens (used by Atlas) & Without static tokens   
   * With clients lcg, fermi, and lbnl  (used to check with 
   * third party transfers between each pair
   * upgrade procedure

Currently using:
   * Hadoop: namenode gw018k0, secondary name-node+!GridFTP+!BeStMan gw018k1, data nodes: gw015k2, gw015k3, gw016k2, gw016k3, gw017k2, gw017k3, gw018k2, gw018k3
   * Bestman on disk: fg0x5 (going away), ?? fg7x5 (going away)
   * Xrootd: cluster on fermicloud (going away)
   * !BeStMan Stress test: some bare-metal in ITB ???fgitb315.fnal.gov:10443 (going away)
   * Xrootd: ??? gw016k0 rdr, gw016k1, gw017k0, gw017k1
   * dCache: (not supported) gwdca06 dCache admin node, gwdca05 PNFS node, gwdca04 SRM, gwdca03 Dcap, GridFTP doors, gwdca02,gwdca01 pool node
