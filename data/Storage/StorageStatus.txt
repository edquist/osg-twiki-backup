This is an internal page for Doug Strain to keep track of what he is doing:

---++ Remaining Tasks for Version 3 Release:

   * SHOWSTOPPER: Globus 5.2 release (library dependency problems)
   * Hadoop: Transition information from Jeff Dost
   * Documentation
      * Finish merging and updating Hadoop documentation
      * SRM Tester
      * RSV probes documentation
      * Gratia probes documentation
      * !BeStMan !GridFTP probes
      * Upgrade procedure: Pacman -> ??? Magic ??? -> RPMs!
   * Testing 
      * RSV: Storage probes and pigeon (many failures 10/25)
      * !GridFTP Gratia probe
      * Go to ITB meetings on Thursday to encourage testing
      * Storage probes: hadoop, xrootd
      * Storage group Hadoop testing?
      * Figure out pre-release testing procedure and possibly re-install test stand
   * Packaging
      * xrootd-dsi: use new DSI repo
      * pigeon tools
      * !BeStMan release: not until first week of December
   * Open tickets: about 8-10

---++ Open Questions:
   * Who is taking over !BeStMan? probably Neha (Alain. 10/24/2011)
   * Are we maintaining dCache Transfer & Storage probes? For now, stays unchanged (Alain. 10/24/2011)
   * xrootd multi-lib?  pulls in wrong dependencies on x84_64
   * What to do about test stand????
   * What testing procedures should continue?  (see below)

Hadoop
   * How should we migrate Hadoop Storage Reports? Hadoop storage report not migrated, assumes gratia collector. This needs investigation (Brian orphan)
      * Query locally? 
   * How about direct procedure for 0.19 -> 0.20 osg? 
   * Look at JMX Monitoring for Bestman Documentation
      * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/HadoopMonitoring

---++ Testing framework

Current test frameworks:
   * Validation testing by Tanya (using static test stand)
   * Stress testing by Haifeng Pi
   * Java based web framework done by Neha
   * RSV / pigeon probes by Doug

Current testing matrix (from validation tests):
   * bestman2_gateway_disk
   * bestman2_gateway_hadoop
   * bestman2_gateway_xrootd
   * bestman_fullmode (drop?) [space reservation]
   * xrootd with 2 clusters and "global" redirector with FRM
   * dCache (only used to test third-party transfer)

Each one should be tested:
   * With static tokens (used by Atlas) & Without static tokens   
   * With clients lcg, fermi, and lbnl  (used to check with 
   * third party transfers between each pair
   * upgrade procedure

Currently using:
   * Hadoop: namenode gw018k0, secondary name-node+!GridFTP+!BeStMan gw018k1, data nodes: gw015k2, gw015k3, gw016k2, gw016k3, gw017k2, gw017k3, gw018k2, gw018k3
   * Bestman on disk: fg0x5 (going away), ?? fg7x5 (going away)
   * Xrootd: cluster on fermicloud (going away)
   * !BeStMan Stress test: some bare-metal in ITB ???fgitb315.fnal.gov:10443 (going away)
   * Xrootd: ??? gw016k0 rdr, gw016k1, gw017k0, gw017k1
   * dCache: (not supported) gwdca06 dCache admin node, gwdca05 PNFS node, gwdca04 SRM, gwdca03 Dcap, GridFTP doors, gwdca02,gwdca01 pool node
