---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
dCache 1.9.2 status
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

More problems have been found in 1.9.2-3. It doesn't seem likely to be released this week. Tanya is on vacation for the next week, so it could not be packaged and tested before she comes back. We should seriously consider to do production release with 1.9.1, dCache has not been released to VDT since September.  

---++ Second Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
ITB testing of !BeStMan, !BeStMan-gateway, !Xrootd

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

Three sites have successfully installed !BeStMan-gateway/Xrootd and started testing. There were multiple suggestions how to improve terminology used in documentation.  It looks like documentation is ready for release.


---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Information Provider tests

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Andrew is working on validation tests.  It goes slowly because he is working on too many projects at the same time.
