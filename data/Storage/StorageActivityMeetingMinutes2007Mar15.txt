The phone conferencing system was evidently not prepared for the time change, so the MeetingPlace number did not work until the meeting was over. We announced through email an alternative number from freephoneconference.com and several attendees called in.

Alex Sim described srm-tester and how it is used to validate development srm installations. It was reported that VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS does not have a functional storage test. Alex affirmed that srm-test could be set up to perform a few simple tests for status testing purposes. It was agreed that srm-test should be used in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS. It was also suggested and agreed to that there be a link for each storage site in VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS that would take the viewer to a test page hosted by LBNL where results of more extensive testing for a particular site would be displayed.

The site-functional dCache test suite developed at DESY was discussed. It was suggested that system administrators could use it to test their installations, given its capacity to test dCache-specific functions such as gridftp, dcap, etc, as well as srm. It was agreed that the suite should be supplied through VDT and that the suite would be offered as a separate install. Neha Sharma has investigated the suite, and reported that it is not yet ready for general use. She is in contact with DESY.

The Gratia dCache probe was discussed. Assignment of writing a storage report module for the Gratia server will be addressed in a followup meeting. A few problems with the installation scripts were mentioned. Michael Zalokar will work on those.

A new patch of dCache is available. Ted Hesselroth will package the new rpm into the VDT bundle. Abhishek Rana agreed to validate the new version, though possibly by only replacing dCache jar files at UCSD.

Testing procedures were discussed. Gene Oleynik stated that new OSG hardware will be ordered, which will allow performant testing of the storage software between that test stand and UCSD. Testing in conjunction with the dCache development test stand is also possible. A followup meeting will be scheduled to define testing criteria.

Ted Hesselroth stated that SRM Watch was about to be released on the dCache web site. When that is done, it will be bundled with the VDT packaging of dCache.
