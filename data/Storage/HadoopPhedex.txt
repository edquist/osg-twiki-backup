The SRM interface to Hadoop is through the Bestman SRM server.  This SRM server has some slight differences in semantics compared with the dCache SRM server.  Most importantly, the Bestman SRM server does not create the parent directories for file copy operations.  The dCache SRM server violates this part of the specification.

The remainder of this document describes some suggested modifications to your phedex agents to work better with Hadoop and Bestman.

---++ Use the FUSE mount on the phedex node

Each invocation of the srm client tools launches a new JVM.  When many file operations occur at the same time (copy, delete, verify) then this can quickly bring a phedex server to its knees. Many sites mount the dCache pnfs filesystem on the phedex node to avoid the need to run =srmrm= to delete files.  Similarly with Hadoop, if you mount the HDFS filesystem with fuse on the phedex server, you can delete files with =rm= command instead of =srmrm=.  Even if you don't use the fuse mount on the phedex server, you can still use the Hadoop CLI to interact with the Hadoop filesystem.

---++ Create leading directories in FileDownloadDelete

Since Bestman SRM does not create the leading directories for file transfers, the phedex agents must do this.  The =FileDownload= agent can be configured to invoke the =FileDownloadDelete= script before transferring a file.  It is here that you will want to create the leading directories.

---++ Delete load test files after transferring

This isn't specific to Hadoop, but is listed here because more than one site has reported this problem.  If PhEDEx load test files are not cleaned up after the transfer is finished, then you will quickly fill up HDFS with junk files.  In the PhEDEx config for the load test agents, you can pass a =-d= flag to the verify script.  The default FileDownloadVerify agent should check for the existence of this flag and delete the file after performing the verification.
