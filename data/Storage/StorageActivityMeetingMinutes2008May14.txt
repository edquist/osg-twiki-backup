Present: Alex Sim, Abhishek Rana, Tanya Levshina


Alex:
BeStman with  GUMS w/roles abilities  is tested, should be in the next VDT release
SrmTester is failing for several sites including Fermi gridwork and FNAL_FERMIGIRD_ITB.  
Will start looking into Gratia probes (transfer and storage space reservation info will be collected by parsing log files)



Abhishek:
Several VOs (CIGI, Engage, CDF and SDSS) are apparently ready to start trying opportunistic storage validation. It is unclear if SDSS would have enough time to do it during next week, so Neha should probably contact Nikolay Kuropatkin to see if we can help. We should be ready to provide help to VOs that would try to test opportunistic storage as users.
