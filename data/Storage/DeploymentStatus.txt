The following table lists very basic information about the deployment status of dCache on OSG.
The purpose of the table is to provide the developers and VDT team a little bit of feedback on
what's going on out there.

   * "site name" is the name of the site as specified via the bdii to LCG.
   * "version deployed" is the dcache version number.
   * "next planned upgrade" is the date or version number to which you intend to upgrade when available.
   * "VDT" and "GRATIA" are fields that are answered with "yes/no" depending on whether or not you use
      the VDT to deploy dCache, and have the GRATIA transfer accounting deployed.
   * "URL" is the standard dCache web page for your site.
