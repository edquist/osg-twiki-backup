Hadoop RPMS:
- requested michael to copy bestman rpms to testing yum repository. 
He copied over bestman-2.2.1.3.18-1.el5.noarch.rpm and bestman2-2.0.5-1.noarch.rpm but not 2.2.1.3.16 or 2.0.3. 
 I asked why those didn't make it and am waiting for a response.

- reviewed Hadoop install tutorial and sent Doug a summary of issues I encountered for reference
