---++ Validating the namemode

Navigate to the namenode web interface at http://namenode.host.name:50070

You should see a web page that shows the date/time when the
namenode was started, the version, when it was compiled, and some
information about any datanodes that may have already contacted
the namenode.

If the web interface does not show up, check the namenode logs in
/var/log/hadoop for any errors.

---++ Validating the datanode

Navigate to the namenode web interface at http://namenode.host.name:50070

You should see an entry for the datanode listed in the list of
live datanodes.  The "Admin State" field should read "In
Service".  The "Last Contact" field should be a reasonably low
number of seconds (under 10).  Verify that the capacity listed in
the other columns matches what you see when you run 'df' on the
datanode data partition(s).

If the datanode does not appear in the list, check the datanode
logs in /var/log/hadoop on the datanode for any errors.

---++ Validating fuse

Check that the fuse mount is active with the 'mount' command:

<verbatim>
# mount | grep dfs
fuse_dfs on /mnt/hadoop type fuse.fuse_dfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,allow_other,default_permissions)
</verbatim>

Create a file in hdfs with the native hadoop cli and then check
if the file exists in the fuse mount path:

<verbatim>
# hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /etc/hosts /junk.txt
# hadoop fs -ls /junk.txt
Found 1 items
-rw-rw-r--   2 root supergroup        234 2009-08-18 22:31
/junk.txt
# ls -l /mnt/hadoop/junk.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root nobody 234 Aug 18 22:31 /mnt/hadoop/junk.txt
</verbatim>

You can also run 'df' to see the space usage:
<verbatim>
# df -h /mnt/hadoop
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
fuse_dfs              320T  293T   27T  92% /mnt/hadoop
</verbatim>
