Jeff:
<pre class="screen">
Hadoop RPMs:
- I set up 0.20 stable branch on Brian's request on the vdt website.  
He will start populating it as soon as the RPMs are finished being tested. http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/hadoop/stable/2.0/rhel5/

0.20 testing issues / notable changes:
- hadoop now runs as user hadoop instead of root (fails to start if run as root)
- HADOOP_NAMENODE_HEAP=2048m the "m" suffix causes java vm to fail
- starting / stopping hadoop daemons writes output to /nohup.out instead of to stdout
- get umask warnings when using hadoop fs commands
- currently getting a Segmentation fault when testing gridftp

---++ First Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
HDFS - BeStMan
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
hdfs 2.0 rpms are in VDT. Jeff has experienced some minor problems while installing it. The major showstopper is  segmentation fault when testing gridftp. Jeff thinks that this could be possible related to authorization. Doug will install all the rpms on our test stand (gw018k nodes are back after disk replacement) and we will check if we see the same problems with GUMS authorization.

Jeff has asked about xrootd rpms that are in hdfs repository. Tanya will talk to Brian to understand where these rpms are coming from.
Jeff will start working on documentation. The first priority is to document software built and upload to VDT.

Also, BeStMan2 2.0.6 should be included into the test cache.

---++ Second Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
BeStMan
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
2.0.6 release should be added to ITB. 2.0.7 has minor changes and Alex needs to work on VDT packaging for bestman2 before this version could be given to ITB.
