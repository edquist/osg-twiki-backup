---+ Verifying the Summarization of the DCache Transfer Probe 

*NOTE*: This page is an internal note for the OSG-Storage team.  It is not meant for the external sysadmin

This page is meant to help a non-developer verify that the summarization is working for the DCache Transfer probe.

---++ Create new records 

Stop any running dCache-transfer probe.  In order to test summarization, we must create a few records that can be summarized.  Turn off all pools in dCache except for one.

Create a small file locally (perhaps 1MB).  Here's a sample command:

<pre class="screen">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/testfile bs=1MB count=1
</pre>

Copy this file into dCache 10 times.  Because there's only one pool online, each should go to the same pool.

---++ Start probe
Edit the ProbeConfig to verify your settings.  The following lines should be set:

<pre class="screen">
CollectorHost="http://gratia-osg-itb-reports.opensciencegrid.org:80"
</pre>
