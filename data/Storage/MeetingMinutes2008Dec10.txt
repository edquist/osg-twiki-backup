Report from Abhishek:

DO:
Joel Snow reported:
Efficiencies are good by historical standards except for ucsd, purdue and pg.ihepa.ufl.edu.

SE's job eff last week:

                      MWT2-IU  N/A

                      UCSD T2  0.234 <= ??

                      UNL      0.936

                      MSU      0.636

                      Purdue   0.145 <= ??


 SBgrid:

The taskforce phase-1 is being completed/closed this week, with a formal
welcome being extended to SBGrid. OSG Storage is welcome to take the
baton from Jeff, who I think has done the best that was possible - given
that SBGrid VO and site was not ready to operate 2 months ago.

CDF:

Plan is to follow the same route as D0 in past. Once the lingering
UPS/UPD problem is fixed, my plan is to send a joint email (from you/OSG
storage and VO Group) to CMS and ATLAS site mgt.


Ted's addendum :  Fermi developers have provided a UPS/UPC srm client. Space has been requested on USCMS Tier2 sites.
