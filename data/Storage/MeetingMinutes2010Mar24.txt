---++ Status report
Abhishek:
<pre class="screen">
UCSD Hadoop testbed is running OSG/VDT Hadoop release 1.0, disk capacity 22 TB with 15 datanodes and O(10) GridFTP servers. 
Near term goal is benchmarking and scalability evaluation. Jointly being operated and coupled with GlideinWMS and OSG Scalability area goals:

1. BeStMan scalability profiling.
2. Benchmarking and I/O profiling of HDFS (without GridFTP).
3. I/O profiling of HDFS with GridFTP.
4. GridFTP optimizations.
5. GlideinWMS scalability tool.

 Bestman2:
 we're reviewing Jetty instead of tomcat, and the release will take time.
The tomcat based bestman2 is given to Brian and Tanya, and the
functionality should be the same as before. When we decide to go on with
Jetty, it'll take some time until we get the working version out.

* Support
  - document review for bestman gateway
  - document review for bestman full mode
  - multiple user id mapping support for recursive copy case in srm-copy
- STAR
  - bestman deployment support for NERSC HPSS
  - bestman and srm-copy/ls usage support for a Chinese user

* Release
  - working on bestman2 test and packaging

---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
dCache transfer probe status
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Andrew is finishing up the development. Will be ready to release a new version soon. He should ask Chris to build the test version and then Neha will create and installed rpm on dcache billing node.
Brian has volunteered to install this version at Nebraska so it could be tested in production environment and realistic load.  

---++ Second Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Chimera
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Ted has started to look at the documentation. He will install it on his node and try it out. We will need to update vdt-dcache installation script and documentation.

---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
NEES work
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
We have the whole framework setup at Purdue and the "production" run started on Tuesday. Doug has been working on web ui that allows to see the current status and do various searches. The monitoring is running on gw014k0.fnal.gov. We are rsync logs from Purdue.
Doug will be doing monitoring during next week and will alert Neha in case of any problem with dcache transfer.
