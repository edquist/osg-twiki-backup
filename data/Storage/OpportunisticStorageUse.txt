---+++ Configuration of Storage Elements for Opportunistic Use

---++++ Introduction

The general requirements for a storage element supporting opportunistic use are

   * Only a portion of the total storage is made available.
   * The amount of storage made available for opportunistic use may be specified.
   * There is a capability of specifying a portion of the total storage for opportunistic use.
   * It is possible to allow particular VOs and Roles a privilege to use space other than opportunistic storage.
   * Files created through opportunistic use shall not be permanently available in the storage system.

---++++ Procedure for dCache 1.8 with SRM 2.2

SRM 2.2 supports [[space reservation][SpaceReservation]]. A storage site administrator may configure the site for opportunistic use through space reservation. In SRM-dCache 1.8 the creation of space reservations is controlled by use use of link groups. The site administrator may assign storage pools to link groups. This shall be the basis of dividing the storage; certain pools are designated for opportunistic use.

Here are the operations that are performed to enable opportunistic use of storage. Note that explicit authorization of privileged VOs is also necesary in order to prohibit opportunistic access.

---+++++ Modification of <nop>PoolManager configuration

Please start from the [[PoolManager][PoolManager.conf]] file described in the SpaceReservation topic.

1. In the file <nop>PoolManager.conf add the following lines for 

<verbatim>
psu create unit -store  public:osg@osm
</verbatim>

2. Add lines to create a unit group and add the new unit to it

<verbatim>
psu create ugroup opportunistic-store
psu addto ugroup opportunistic-store public:osg@osm
</verbatim>

3. Determine which pools shall be designated for opportunistic use.  Add a line for each of these pools. The names to use are the ones used internally by dCache. See the dCache documentation for how to determine the correct pool names.

<verbatim>
psu create pool poolnode1_1
psu create pool poolnode1_2
psu create pool poolnode2_1
psu create pool poolnode2_2
psu create pool poolnode3_2
psu create pool poolnode3_2
</verbatim>

4. Create a pool group for opportunistic use and add the pools to it.

<verbatim>
psu create pgroup opportunistic-pools
psu addto pgroup opportunistic-pools poolnode1_1
psu addto pgroup opportunistic-pools poolnode1_2
psu addto pgroup opportunistic-pools poolnode2_1
psu addto pgroup opportunistic-pools poolnode2_2
psu addto pgroup opportunistic-pools poolnode3_1
psu addto pgroup opportunistic-pools poolnode3_2
</verbatim>

5. Create a link group that includes this pool group and links it to the store unit defined above.

<verbatim>
# opportunistic - for public use of storage
psu create link opportunistic-link opportunistic-store world-net any-protocol
psu set link opportunistic-link -readpref=10 -writepref=20 -cachepref=10 -p2ppref=-1
psu add link opportunistic-link opportunistic-pools
</verbatim>

6. Create a link group for non-custodial files that includes the above link.

<verbatim>
# HSM setting will not allow writing of custodial files to the opportunistic area
psu create linkGroup opportunistic-link-group
psu addto  linkGroup opportunistic-link-group opportunistic-link
psu set    linkGroup attribute opportunistic-link-group HSM=None
psu set linkGroup custodialAllowed opportunistic-link-group false
psu set linkGroup onlineAllowed opportunistic-link-group true
psu set linkGroup nearlineAllowed opportunistic-link-group true
psu set linkGroup replicaAllowed opportunistic-link-group true
psu set linkGroup outputAllowed opportunistic-link-group true
</verbatim>

Save the [[OpportunisticPoolManager][new PoolManager.conf]]. 

7. Load the new rules into the <nop>PoolManager.

<verbatim>
$ ssh -l admin -c blowfish -p 22223 localhost
admin@localhost's password: 

    dCache Admin (VII) (user=admin)


(local) admin > cd PoolManager
(PoolManager) admin > reload -yes

</verbatim>

8. Check that the rules were loaded into the <nop>PoolManager.

<verbatim>
(PoolManager) admin > psu dump setup 
#
# Printed by diskCacheV111.poolManager.PoolSelectionUnitV2 at Wed Nov 14 09:56:54 CST 2007
#
#
#
# The units ...
#
psu create unit -net    0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255
psu create unit -net    0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0
psu create unit -store  *@*
psu create unit -protocol */*
psu create unit -store  public:osg@osm
#
...
</verbatim>

If you don't see the new store unit, load the new rules by restarting the dCache domain.

10. <font color="red">Skip this step. Non-default option does not work.</font>
Decide if your site's policy will be that opportunistic users must use a space reservation to write files. The alternative is allowed and is the default; srm will create a space reservation for the transfer if the write is otherwise allowed. It is important to note that these space reservations expire immediately when the transfer finishes, and thus the file could be removed soon afterwards if the Space Reservation Cleaner tool (see below) is so configured. To force the use of space reservations set the line in /opt/d-cache/config/srmSetup to 

<verbatim>
srmImplicitSpaceManagerEnabled=no
</verbatim>

11. Modify the <nop>LinkGroupAuthorization.conf described in  [[SpaceResServerSetup][Server Setup]] to add authorization for any authenticated user to make space reservations in the opportunistic storage area and restrict access to the other link groups. An example /opt/d-cache/etc/LinkGroupAuthorization.conf is
<verbatim> 
LinkGroup default-link-group
uscms/Role=*
usatlas/Role=*

LinkGroup volatile-link-group
*/Role=cmsuser

LinkGroup opportunistic-link-group
*/Role=*
</verbatim>

If you would like a more restrictive policy, see step 17 below.


12. If you changed /opt/d-cache/config/srmSetup in step 10, restart srm to pick up the changes. Otherwise, reload the link groups and link group authorizations in <nop>srmSpaceManger.

<verbatim>
$ ssh -l admin -c blowfish -p 22223 localhost
admin@localhost's password: 

    dCache Admin (VII) (user=admin)


(local) admin > cd SrmSpaceManager@srm-oursiteDomain
(SrmSpaceManager@srm-cd-oursiteDomain) admin > update link groups
update started
(SrmSpaceManager@srm-oursiteDomain) admin > 
</verbatim>

13. Create a directory for the rootpath of the opportunistic storage area.

<verbatim>
# cd /pnfs/oursite.edu/data
# mkdir public
# chmod 777 public
</verbatim>

14. Tag the directory as belonging to the opportunistic store unit defined above in PoolManager.conf.

<verbatim>
# cd public
# cat '.(tag)(OSMTemplate)'
StoreName myStore
# echo "StoreName public" > ".(tag)(OSMTemplate)"
# cat '.(tag)(OSMTemplate)'
StoreName public
# echo "osg" > ".(tag)(sGroup)"
# grep "" $(cat ".(tags)()")
.(tag)(OSMTemplate):StoreName public
.(tag)(sGroup):osg
</verbatim>

15. Tag the access latency of this rootpath as ONLINE and the retention policy as REPLICA.

<verbatim>
# echo  "ONLINE" > ".(tag)(AccessLatency)"
# echo  "REPLICA" > ".(tag)(RetentionPolicy)"
</verbatim>

16. Find out what user names opportunistic users will map to, either from [[http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_config_gums.html][gums.config]] on your GUMS server, or from [[http://www.dcache.org/manuals/Book/ch12s05.shtml][grid-volemap]] on your gPlazma node, depending on which method is activated. Authorize these users to access the storage area defined above by adding lines to /etc/grid-security/storage-authzdb on the gPlazma node such as.

<verbatim>
authorize cdf    read-write 9500 5000 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize dzero  read-write 9501 5001 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize gadu   read-write 9502 5002 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize sdss   read-write 9503 5003 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize ligo   read-write 9504 5004 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize star   read-write 9505 5005 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize ivdgl  read-write 9506 5006 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize gridex read-write 9507 5007 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize fmri   read-write 9508 5008 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize mis    read-write 9509 5009 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize grase  read-write 9510 5010 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
authorize glow   read-write 9511 5011 / /pnfs/oursite.edu/data/public /
</verbatim>

17. (Optional) If you would like to restrict opportuntistic use to particular VOs, modify the authorization for opportunistic link group in /opt/d-cache/etc/LinkGroupAuthorization.conf such as the following.

<verbatim> 
LinkGroup opportunistic-link-group
cdf/Role=*
dzero/Role=*
gadu/Role=*
sdss/Role=*
ligo/Role=*
star/Role=*
ivdgl/Role=*
gridex/Role=*
fmri/Role=*
mis/Role=*
grase/Role=*
glow/Role=*
</verbatim>

Repeat step 12 to cause the authorization file to be reloaded into <nop>srmSpaceManager.

18. Users can now make their own space reservations, or if srmImplicitSpaceManagerEnabled is not set to "no" in srmSetup (see step 10), srm will create space reservations for them per transfer. If you would like to make a space reservation for opportunistic use, do so with a command such as the following.

<verbatim>
$ /opt/d-cache-1.8/srm/bin/srm-reserve-space --retention_policy=REPLICA --access_latency=ONLINE -lifetime=7776000 \
-desired_size=500000000000 -guaranteed_size=500000000000 -space_desc=public-token srm://cd-97177.fnal.gov:8443
Storage Resource Manager (SRM) CP Client version 2.0
...
Space token =107
lifetime = null
access latency = ONLINE
retention policy = REPLICA
guaranteed size = 500000000000
total size = 500000000000
$
</verbatim>

The above creates a space reservation of 250GB that expires in 90 days.

19. Upgrade your ldap server to use glue schema 1.3 and publish your opportunistic storage area. See GlueOpportunisticStorageArea.
