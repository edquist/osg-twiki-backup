</verbatim>

A few changes to the glue schema 1.3 implementation were discussed. It was decided to

1. Use Alex Sim's suggestion of not putting the Path in Endpoint for ControlProtocol, though "SFN=" will be included.
2. Enter it into Path in StorageArea instead.
3. For compatibility with 1.2, create a StorageArea for each VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo using the old schema, and a generic StorageArea with VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoInfo subelements for the 1.3 schema.
4. Continue to include AccessProtocol as a transition to using ControlProtocol only.


Grep Sharp asked about the progress of the Gratia probe packaging. Michael Zalokar in in the process of setting up testing. It was decided that Michael would proceed to packaging the probe for testing at UCSD.
