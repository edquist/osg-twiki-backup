---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Documentation (Robert)
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Robert was interested about the current state of storage documentation. Doug is working on RSV probe. Neha (reviewer) and Tanya (owner) have finished with 
[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/GratiaDcacheProbes][Gratia dCache probe documentation]. We are waiting for Suchandra whi is assigned as tester. Neha will try to review all documents related to storage srm clients before July 23d.

---++ Second agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Pigeon tools
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Some bugs has been fixed and it is ready for testing. Will address LIGO issue: need to use proxy from non-standard location.

---++ Third agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
vdt-dcache
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Suchandra have discovered some problems while trying to upgrade dcache without migrating to chimera. Neha has fixed these problems. We will need to release vdt-dcache 3.0.2 (probably with new dCache server).

---++ Fourth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
LIGO problems
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Derek and Brian have received all the relevant scripts and config files from Britta. They have noticed that wrong gridftp has been used for file transfer. They will try to work with Britta to change turl first, then try to use multiple gridftp servers associated with a storage element (they would be used automatically if transfer is done via srm. Britta is not using srm because rfc compliant proxy is required).
