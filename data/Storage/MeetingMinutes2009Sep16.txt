Andrew  :
<pre class="screen">
I have been studying and deploying syslogng as one of the core candidate 
software for troubleshooting service.
</pre>

Neha:
<pre class="screen">
   1. followed up on tickets for this week
   2. email exchanges about OSG-Storage policy on handling user support
   3. email exchanges about "Linux Baseline issue found (kernel outdated)" issue on test lustre nodes.
       fermlab security thinks kernel is outdated, but what we have is the latest kernel that sun provides for lustre
   4. discussion with tanya about storage element validation package. working on design document for the same.
read documentation on bestman. working on documenting the usage of all lbnl commands against various Storage Elements.
</pre>

Ted: 
<pre class="screen">
I submitted for review a patch in gPlazma that dCache RT #5089 (expected
mapping not seen) and GOC Footprints #7380 (srm space reservation not
working).

I am looking at the MyOSG code to see where integration of the discovery
tool could be done.

*discussed/explained bestman-gateway configuration
  * lcg-cp usage of srmGetSpaceMetaData - unusedSize
    - inquired in SRM collab mailing list
    - return zero size when unuzed size is not available

* Start discussion on the communication between bestman server
configuration and client options:
  https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Storage/BeStManUseCases

* Provide feedback and correct the info about bestman, with Tanya, on

---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->

Trash/Trash/Troubleshooting/log collection discussion (Andrew)
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

Andrew has proposed to combine syslog-ng with a web service that allows authorized administrator to request specific logs with some particular filtering to be forwarded to requester's node.
Brian has suggested to talk to Alain first in order to figure out why the attempts to use syslog-ng had failed before. Tanya is planning to discuss it with Alain before we proceed any further.
Neha thought that historic information should be available as well , e.g. if you want to troubleshoot specific dcache transaction. Andrew thought that we should concentrate only on reproducible problems so only real time access should be available. 

---++ Second Agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Storage discovery tools status - packaging , integration with MyOSG (Ted)
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Ted is working with Arvind looking for ways to integrate discovery tools  with  MyOSG

---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Progress with SCEC, LIGO (Ted)
---+++ Discussion

Information from Mats:
<pre class="screen">
The status at Caltech is that I think I have been able to transport most
of the data there, but jobs is still not working well. There has been an
effort to improve the preemption policy on these CMS sites and I will
talk to Michael Thomas to see what the status with their site is.

Firefly I will need some help with. The SRM service is back online, but
transfers are very slow (I'm guessing slow enough that transfers will
never finish). So, if your group could help debug where the problem is
that would be very helpful.
</pre>

Action items:
   1. Michael has modified the preemption policy late last week. Will ask Mats if he sees any improvements. 
   1. Brian has asked to submit ticket to GOC for Firefly.
   1. Ted will contact Florida again to see if they have fixed problems with GIP

We should continue discussion with LIGO. Brian doesn't think that environment should be obtained from BDII, it should be done at runtime by job itself.

---++ Forth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
 lustre  installation (Neha)
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Server node has been installed and configured. Still there are some problems with a client node. Fermi security has issues with patched kernel required for lustre.
