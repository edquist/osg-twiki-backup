Ted went through the Gantt chart for Storage Activities. Short-term tasks point towards a Dec. 14 beta1 version of the Storage package for OSG 1.0. Most testing will be done on the beta1 version, leading to a beta2 version on Jan. 18, 2008. ITB upgrades can be begin with the beta1 version, though the target for ITB testing is beta2. Some of the more complex options, such as the Replica Manager and Opportunistic Storage, will not be part of the install dialog until beta2, though testing on their functionality will proceed with beta1. All clients, Fermilab, LBL, and lcg-utils, will be tested during beta1 and repeated for beta2. The Gratia probes and glue schema dialog will be tested during beta2, moved up to beta1 if possible.

The problem of space reservation not working on <nop>GridWorks with implicit reservations turned off was discussed. Tanya reported that the problem could be duplicated on the fapl test stand after Neha's upgrade to dCache 1.8 there yesterday. Ted reported that he is doing a fresh install of dCache 1.8 on his own machine and will use a debugger to analyze the problem if necesary.

Particulars of the latest LBL client tools were discussed with Alex.
