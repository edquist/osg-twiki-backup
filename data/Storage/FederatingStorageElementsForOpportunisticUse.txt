%TOC%

The proposal is to allow users to access all opportunistic storage on OSG via a grid centralized storage element. The motivation is to hide from the user the current necessity of making the storage available and to provide the mechanisms of discovery, etc, as a backend service. Technical feasibility of a few software implementations are discussed.
