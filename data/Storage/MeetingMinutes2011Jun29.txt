---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
!BeStMan2 release
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

   1. !BeStMan2 2.0.14 client/server from pacman test cache is being tested. So far there is no problem. Will be released to ITB this week.
   1. Alex is still working on 2.1.x release for rpm and hopes to have a final release by Friday. Doug is planning to use VDT  RPM guidelines/scripts to built new pre-release version.
   1. Tanya has raised a concern that  bestman server, installed from rpm, is configured to be owned by user "bestman". In pacman distribution default is "daemon" user. If someone decides to upgrade to a new version from rpm, the owner user name used before should be preserved.  Doug will look into it.
   1. Jeff will fix a known bug in bestman2.0.13 config script to rebuild rpm in osg-hadoop yum repository and release it. The 2.1.x release will need to go through the testing cycle first.

---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
VDT RPM guidelines 

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
We have a short discussion about guidelines. We are ready to discuss it with the rest of the group when OSG Summer School is over. The most confusing parts:
   * structure of svn directory 
   * how strictly we are planning to follow the Fedora guidelines (e.g "All program binaries and program libraries included in Fedora packages must be built from the source code that is included in the source package.")? For example, should we built bestman libs such as opensaml-1.0.1.jar, cryptix32.jar, log4j-1.2.15.jar, wsdl4j-1.6.2.jar, xercesImpl-2.9.1.jar, axis.jar, commons-discovery-0.2.jar from source in order to build bestman?
