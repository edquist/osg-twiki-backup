The table below shows the likelihood that a particular SE-related role would do a task. It's not a complete list nor is it accurate: feel free to add and edit by clicking the "Edit this table!" beneath the last row.

You can also add, change or delete rows with the "Edit this table!" button. 

If you want add a Role column, it's probably easier on you just to call [[Main.ForrestChristian][Forrest Christian]] and have him do it because it's a pain.
