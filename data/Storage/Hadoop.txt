---+ Hadoop Distributed File System

The Hadoop Distributed File System (!HDFS) is a highly scalable, very reliable distributed file system developed by the Apache project as a part of the Hadoop data processing system.  The primary contributor (and largest user) is Yahoo.  !HDFS is based on the design of the Google File System.  !HDFS's strengths is in its ability to use commodity hard drives in worker nodes; it can turn a large amount of semi-reliable hardware into a system which is very reliable.

To find out more information about HDFS, [[http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/][visit its home page]].  If you are thinking about installing Hadoop, we also recommend reading the [[http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/hdfs_design.html][HDFS architecture page]].

This page covers the OSG's usage of Hadoop, and includes instructions for installing a grid-enabled HDFS system.

---++ Information for Site Admins

---+++ Preparation

If you plan on installing a Hadoop SE on the OSG, we recommend [[HadoopUnderstanding][starting off with the planning document]].

Just *curious about HDFS?*  The planning document includes a [[HadoopUnderstanding#Minimal_Installation_0_50TB_WAN][section on a minimal install]].  For the HDFS core components, this would require at least 3 nodes (1 namenode and 2 datanodes), but this will not give you full functionality.  It will take 5 nodes to enable all the components.

---+++ Installation
Once you have read the planning document and feel you understand the general architecture, follow these guides (in order).

Major components:
   * [[HadoopInstallation][Hadoop and FUSE]].  This guide covers installation of the core HDFS components, including the FUSE-based mounts.  Once completed, you will be able to store files and interact with the file system locally.
   * [[HadoopGridFTP][GridFTP]].  This guide covers installation of the HDFS-aware !GridFTP server.  Once completed, you should be able to copy files in and out of HDFS through the grid-standard WAN protocol, !GridFTP.
   * [[HadoopSRM][SRM]].  This covers the installation of a !BeStMan SRM server on top of HDFS.  Once completed, you should be able to interact with HDFS via SRM, a grid-standard webservices protocol for doing metadata operations remotely.

Minor components:
   * [[HadoopGratia][Gratia Probe]].  The Gratia probe instruments the !GridFTP servers running on HDFS; it uses their log files to send records of all completed transfers to a central server.  Once completed, you should see transfers at your site show up in the central OSG accounting.
   * [[HadoopStorageReports][Hadoop Chronicle Storage Reports]].  These are gratia-based storage reports that give you a daily and historical view of the status of your Hadoop cluster.
   * [[HadoopXrootd][Xrootd server]].  (Experimental).  Using Xrootd to export your data over the WAN and allow quick and secure ROOT access to files.
   * [[HadoopApache][Apache integration]]. Configuring the Apache web server to serve up files from HDFS

---+++ Validation

These guides provide simple tests you can perform to see if your install is functioning.
   * [[HadoopCoreValidation][Hadoop Core + FUSE]].
   * [[HadoopGridftpValidation][Hadoop / GridFTP interface]].
   * [[HadoopSRMValidation][SRM verification]].
   * [[HadoopGratiaValidation][Gratia validation]].

---+++ Operations and Troubleshooting
HDFS, while relatively easy to administrate, is not completely headache free!  The pages below offer tips and tricks for operating and maintaining HDFS.
   * [[HadoopOperations][Operations]].  How to operate a stable HDFS instance.  Keep this page handy.
   * [[HadoopDebug][Troubleshooting]].
   * [[HadoopUpgrade][Upgrades]].  This page has not yet been written.
   * [[HadoopRecovery][Recovery]].
   * [[HadoopMonitoring][Monitoring]].
   * [[HadoopPhedex][Phedex Agent Tips]].  CMS-specific tips to getting their transfer application working optimally with HDFS.
