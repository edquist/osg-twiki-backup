%TOC%

A workflow is an abstract series of actions organized by workunits. A workflow scenario is a workflow conceived of as being executed by a collection of software and resource categories.

---++Storage Model Components

Entities and the actions on them, to be composed into workflows.

---+++Entities

Logical objects and resources.

||
|Job|
|Input Data|
|Intermediate Data|
|Output Data|
|Storage Element|
|Compute Element|
|CE/SE Combo|
|Distributed Data Collection|
|Federated Storage Resource|
|Schema|

---+++Actions

Operations that can be performed on Entities.

||
|Advertise|
|Transfer|
|Aggregate|
|Select|
|Replicate|
|Discover|
|Validate|


---++Software Domain Capabilities
|||
|1A|Trigger job based on existence of data, local|
|1B|Trigger job based on future existence of data, local|
|1C|Trigger job based on arrival of data, local|
|1D|Trigger job based on existence of data, remote|
|1E|Trigger job based on future existence of data, remote|
|1F|Trigger job based on arrival of data, remote|
|2A-F|Trigger data movement ...|
||Replicate one unit of data|
||Replicate a data collection|
||Validate one unit of data|
||Validate a data collection|
||Detect job completion|
||Retry a job|
||Retry a one unit data transfer|
||Retry a data collection transfer|
||Write metadata|
||Read metadata|
||Verify resource availability|

---++Software Capability Table

A table of software features vs the above capability requirements.

||Endpoint Discovery|Matchmaking|
|IRODS|ICAT catalog|NA|
|OSG Discovery Tool|BDII|NA|
|OSGMM|NA|!ReSS|
|!ReSS|BDII copy|classads|
|!MyOSG|

---++Workunits

Small collections of actions, to be composed into workflows.

Table shows associated software domains or principals associated with the provided capability or activity.

||User|Admin|Site|Grid|CE|SE|Worker Node|Information Service|Discovery|Matchmaking|Catalog|LAN access|WAN Access|
|Send data to Job|
|Send job to Data|
|Aggregate intermediate products locally|
|Aggregate intermediate products remotely|
|Select Storage Element|
|Select Compute Element|
|Select CE/SE Combo|
|Define a Data Collection|
|Federate Storage Resources|


---++Workflows

Each workflow is described along with its capability requirements.

---+++1 Send data to a Job

   1. A CE/SE combination is chosen

---++++1 Capability Requirements

   1. Knowledge or discovery of authorized CE/SE combo.
   
---++++1 Workflow Scenario

---+++2 Send a job to Data

   1. CEs and the SE are not related, except for the merge job.

---++++2 Capability Requirements

   1. Knowledge or discovery of authorized CEs and CE/SE combo.
   
---++++1 Workflow Scenario

---+++3 Run a job using locally-stored product of a previous job

---++Workflow Scenario Deployment Table

A table of software deployment possibilities vs Workflows. One workflow may have several deployment options.
