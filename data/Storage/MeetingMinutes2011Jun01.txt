Doug:
<pre class="screen">
- xrootd: 3.0.4 not out yet.  Still RC1
- bestman: Working on building bestman2 from source for VDT repo.  Should have rpm out later this week.
</pre>

Jeff:<pre class="screen">
Hadoop 0.20 RPMs 
- failed attempting to build Bestman2 2.0.13 rpm.  Fails on make missing java extensions: jaxp_parser_impl, xml-commons-apis.
- Brian had similar problems for 2.0.12.  Creating the source tarball using configure script makes build dependent on initial download location.  Further investigation is needed to determine if I'm having the same problem.

Documentation
- working on the layout on https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/Hadoop20Install.
- need to figure out how much to include in subsections for installing each component
</pre>

Mock prerequisites are setup (Thanks to Doug for his help). 
Able to initialize the mock environment --- however reports several missing dependencies..in progress
