DO status (Abhishek)

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

D0 has reported  problems with storage on several sites. We will need to investigated it. Tanya proposed to have a weekly meeting with Joel Snow in order to really understand if the reported problems caused by dcache and try to determine the root of the problems.

Also discussed  how to address the complains of the data lost raised at OSG Facility meeting. It looks like most of the time the data are not lost but are not available because some pool is not responding due to various reasons and all the transfers are stuck. Brian estimates that "real" data lost is about 5% at Nebraska. Apparently nobody has investigated the cause. 
 Brian said that we can try to simulate some of the problems using the storage facility at Nebraska.
