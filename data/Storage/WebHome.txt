---++Introduction

OSG is both a Data Grid and a Computational Grid. That is to say management of data (as well as jobs) is a key part of the architecture and services of the common infrastructure. The OSG Stakeholder requirements on data management (movement, storage, access, tracking, control, monitoring) vary widely.

*Storage Scales*

   * _Petabyte scale:_ with a need to store and track up to 10s of petabytes, and stream and store 10s of Terabytes to be accessed locally by or delivered locally from jobs running on OSG sites. 
   * _Terabyte scale:_ with data needing to be moved to moved 'on the fly' to and from jobs scheduled to run on OSG sites. 
   * _Gigabyte scale:_ with typically many ancillary files needed by each job in order to operate on the main data store.

*Storage Environments*

   * _Owned storage_:
   * _Public storage_:(Storage.OpportunisticStorage)
   * _Local storage_:  


*The Storage Architecture*
   * _Distributed Storage_:
   * _Resource Management_:
   * _Data transfer_:
   * _Replication_:
   * _Archiving_:
   * _Namespace_:

   Information Services

   * _Catalogs_:
   * _Monitoring_:
   * _Discovery_:
   * _Accounting_:

The first four are typically bundled together and make up what is known as a "Storage Element". The latter four are realized as independent components that tie into the job execution stack as well. See "Storage Infrastructure Software", below, for details on specific implementations found in the OSG.

---++Storage Activities in the Open Science Grid

The scope of OSG Storage and Data management includes:

   * *Storage Element* implementation, policy, deployment and documentation about storage areas that are accessible to the OSG infrastructure. 
      * The storage resources are of clearly-defined types (tape and disk), and flavor (permanent, persistent, transient, and volatile). 
      * Interfaces for the writing and reading of data by applications to and from storage over the grid. 
      * Policies and agreements for use of Storage Resources on OSG. 
   * *Local Storage* implementation, policy, deployment and documentation of storage accessible to the applications when running on an OSG site. 
      * Definition of the data and storage areas available in the job's execution environment. 
      * Policies and agreements for the use and management of local storage on OSG sites. 
   * *Storage Interface Definitions* with respect to interoperability of storage resources across Grids.

*Weekly Storage Activity Meetings*

Meetings are every Wednesday
   * *Time:* 3:00 pm Central 
   * *Call:* 510-665-5437 
   * *Meeting ID:* 0655 

See also the [[Storage.MeetingMinutes][Minutes from past meetings]]

*OSG Storage Mailing List*
osg-storage@opensciencegrid.org

*OSG Storage Workshops*

   * [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&confId=2538][2009 OSG Storage Forum]]
   * Storage.HdfsWorkshop

*The OSG Storage Software Roadmap*

For a more complete use of storage, the following infrastructure capabilities would be provided.

   * Matchmaking.
   * Data Placement.
   * Catalogs.
   * Replication.
   * Grid Buffering.

---++ Further Information

If you still have questions about Storage on the Open Science Grid, more Storage and Data Management documentation on the OSG TWiki may be found in ReleaseDocumentation.

You may also open a GOC ticket, or write directly to the OSG Storage mailing list, see above. Note: you must first be added to the mailing list to post to it.
