Abhishek:
<pre class="screen">
 
(a) More machines are being added to testbed, to extend it from 2 data 
nodes to ~20 nodes. This will enable evaluation of scalability. 
Features/functionality evaluation on wide matrix of OS platforms can 
be done on VMs - still to be planned.

(b) Preparation to host a full YUM repository is in progress. This 
will be used to make stable golden releases of OSG Hadoop RPMs. 

(c) Release documentation may be based on YUM deployment method.

  fixed the issue with validate script in latest vdt-dcache package

  followed up and maintained osg storage tickets

  - planning to add a feature - transfer server selection based on
storage location : timeline TBD

Meetings:
          meeting with Brian to discuss detailed requirements for public storage availability
          storage documentation meeting
          meeting with Dan and Marco to discuss T3 documentation
          T3 meeting
          STG meeting - software acceptance requirements, OIM 
Support:
            GOC #ticket 7615 - mulitple problems with srm copy 
               (failure to accept grid  RFC 3820 proxy  by BeStMan and dcache without providing any reasonable error; 
                srm-copy requires additional / in TURL when token to GrdiFTP directly) 

  Technical work:
        Restarted tests after KVM updates:
         * Could not reproduced xrootdfs/xrootd problem we have seen before, discussed with developers
           xrootdfs/xrootd workflow
         * Asked Rob to restart PhEDEx test
        Worked on OSG storage documentation proposal, reviewed existing twiki pages relate to storage 
        Released vdt-dcache 2.4.3 (dcache server 1.9.5-9)
        Found problem with bestman proxy caching - notified developers
        Tested changes in config.ini/configure_osg provided by Suchandra, found several problems  - should be fixed in couple of weeks
        Wrote Bestman-gateway documentation for T3 that incorporate the change configuration procedure
        Reviewed Brian's document about public storage availability
