discussed globusonline with Maxim

xrootd native packaging:
 - discussed the content of xrootd-dsi package, tested several version, wrote installation instructions
            https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/HowToInstallGridFTPXrootd
continued testing of bestman2 2.0.10 server and client - some issues still needs to be debugged  

Run several tests between Nebraska and Wisconsin, transferring 5000 files, ~80GB. The times varies from 2 hours 30 minutes to 1 hours 20 minutes. Most of the testes were successful but there are still some issues that need to be debugged on the local hdfs installation. 

Tested bestman 2.0.10/hdfs 0.2 rpms built by Jeff. Have not encountered any problems.
