 <!-- DESCRIPTION -->

<br /><br />1. Discussed the issue with troubleshooting dcache in production mode. The ability to have access to all log files as well as, probably, admin interface seems to be necessary. Agreed to raise this issue with ET.<br /><br />2. Discussed D0 multiple failures over weekend in UCSD, Nebraska and Purdue. Purdue failure is under investigation, the site needed to restart dcache in order to resume operation. SRM logs are filled with exceptions, other logs are not available. Based on Abhishek and Brian description the following scenario is often causing problems in dcache:<br />      a. pool went down and it was not detected by SRM and Pool Manager<br />      b. Multiple jobs continue high rate requests for files that are located on this pool <br />      c. dcache crashes <br />It is unknown if this is documented somewhere or acknowledged by developers. It is unclear how to reproduce this problem. Abhishek and Brian have mentioned that they have seen it happening during D0 production. Abhishek thinks that failure of the pools designated for D0 is due partially to flaky hardware. It was discussed that amount of allowed simultaneous reads per pool should be decreased to 5 (10 now).<br /><br />Also, Nebraska has upgraded dcache, so D0 should be able to do Nebraska - MIT transfer<br /><br />3.
