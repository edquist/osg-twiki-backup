Started writing front page of OSG docs for Storage.

Got dCache 1.9.2 running in Intellij IDE and profiled XACML client using
JProfiler. There is about 10 %  extra processing due to opensaml
marshalling/unmarshalling, but overall speed of client is about the same
as SAML1.

Got new GUMS running in Intellij IDE and profiled XACML GUMS service
using JProfiler. Found XACML to be about 1/2 as fast as SAML1 on the
server side. This is due mainly to marshalling/unmarshalling in XACML
taking about 10 times as long as for SAML1.
