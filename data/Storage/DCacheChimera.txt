Chimera is the replacement for pnfs, the orginal dCache name service. The original motivation for the rewrite was performance: in any distributed storage system the nameserver can be a bottleneck. The primary way of achieving that goal was allowing access to Chimera from dCache components through an API, as opposed to to requiring all communication through the filesystem interface as is the case with pnfs. Nevertheless, Chimera does provide a mountable filesystem which satisfies the NFS 4.1 specification.

The NFS 4.1 specification provides for mounting distributed storage in such a way that ordinary unix commands (cp, ls, etc) may work without modification.
