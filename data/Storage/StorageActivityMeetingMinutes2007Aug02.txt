---+++ Discussion

UCSD reports that their test stand will be ready for transfers next week. Installation of the gridworks cluster at FNAL is nearly complete. Neha will install dCache 1.8 on it. It was decided that we can now remove dCache 1.8 from the old fapl nodes and install the latest dCache 1.7 on them for ITB testing. Tanya will do this. Other than the dcache-server version, the configuration will not change.  Tanya will also do an informal check of Replica Manager functionality.

Test plans for Replica Manager and the Billing cell have been written by Tanya and Neha respectively. TBD who will write the test plan for Space Reservation. Ted and Michael will implement the test plans in either python or perl; test scripts to run on the client and verification scripts to run the the dCache nodes which check the  state of dCache against the expected output. Ted is investigating Inca (used in Teragrid) as a framework for running scripts, storing their output, and producing reports.

From the OSG site admins workshop, new dCache installations using VDT scripts will be done at the University of Oklahoma(USATLAS), Penn State University(LIGO), and Caltech (LIGO). Karthik Arunachalam of the University of Oklahoma has in the near term time available to work on OSG Storage and after some experience in installing/operating dCache, the tentative plan is for him to complete the dCache-specific site-functional test.
