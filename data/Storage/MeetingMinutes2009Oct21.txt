---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Bestman-gateway/Xrootd and static space tokens/xrootd "used bytes" script (Tanya, Alex, Wei) 
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Tanya has tested "used bytes" script & c code provided by Wei and asked Alain to include it into VDT distribution.
Alain has raised the concern that code is not a part of any release , does not have an "owner"  or a release version. Tanya has asked Wei to include this code with !XrootdFS release. The script will be used by  !BeStMan-gateway with underlying Xrootd. It requires xrootd libraries so it makes sense to release it together with !XrootdFS. Wei agreed but pointed out that if executed on !XrootdFS node just C executable should be sufficient (no need to have a script). Tanya will try it.

Question to Alex: When !BeStman-gateway is configured with static space tokens and underlying DFS reports that amount of used space exceeded the allocated quota  !BeStMan still proceeds with executing srm-cp command that is failing (in case of HDFS) or succeeding (in case of Xrootd). Is it possible/needed to modify !BeStMan to honor quota limitation?
