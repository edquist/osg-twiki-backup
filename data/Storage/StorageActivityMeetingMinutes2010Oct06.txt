Converted text of summary to Powerpoint presentation for Software Tools Group. 
Could not attend STG meeting, but the topic was discussed and Tanya Levshina produced meeting summary. 
Based on that and subsequent email correspondence, looking at existing catalog implementations for incorporation, 
and studying a compromise in the design that would allow catalog integration to occur later in the development process, 
to the end of releasing allocation management slightly earlier than in the current plan. 
Worked on CHEP presentation for OSG Discovery Tool. 
Worked on modifying, reviewing, and testing OSG Storage documents.
