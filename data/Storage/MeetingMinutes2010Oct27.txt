---++ Second agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
!BeStMan2 and XACML
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
We have tested new release of !BeStMan2 with 2.2.5 privilege jars  and  certificate caching. All stress tests were successful on our test stand. !BeStMan2 is installed at Nebraska on a production node since Monday. 

Ted has compared the 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 privilege.jars source code and has discovered that the only difference is in the socket timeouts. This change can not really fix any memory leaks.  Is it possible that fixing caching helped to solve memory problem? Nebraska's admin is planning to upgrade the second server soon, it took several days before !BeStMan2 died with OutOfMemory error. We will know early next week if this release somehow fixes the memory problem.

We will need to discuss with Gabriele, Ted and Alain the ownership and home repository for privilege code.

---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
RSV and storage probes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Doug is still working with Scot to make storage and srmtester probes working with new RSV framework. We have decided to postpone the work on the pigeon probes because of the multiple issues Doug has encountered while trying to make probes working with RSV. We will have face to face meeting with Alain to discuss how to proceed. 

---++ Forth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
XrootdFS config script in VDT

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Doug Benjamin has discovered a bug in vdt configuration script. Due to this bug "xrootdfs" owner has to belong to the group with the same name. Doug will fix this and it will be in the next VDT releases (in 2 weeks). Meanwhile we have put a warning in documentation.
