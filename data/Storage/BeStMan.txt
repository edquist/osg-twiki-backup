---++ Berkeley Storage Manager (!BeStMan) SRM v2.2 status

!BeStMan is a full implementation of SRM v2.2, developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, for a small disk based storage and mass storage systems such as HPSS. End users may have their own personal !BeStMan that manages and gives an SRM interface to their local disks. It works on top of existing disk-based unix file system, and has been reported so far to work on file systems such as NFS, PVFS, AFS, GFS, and Lustre. It also works with any existing file transfer service, such as gsiftp, http, https, bbftp and ftp. It requires the minimal administrative efforts on the deployment and updates. If storage spans on multiple file systems and storage systems, [[ReleaseDocumentation.DCache][SRM/dCache]] should be considered.
