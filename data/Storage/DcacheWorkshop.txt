	* ~42TB currently, phased growth ongoing. 
	* ~11 dCache infrastructure nodes with various hardware configs.
	* 1 Core + 1 PNFS + 1 Replica Mgr + 1 DCap + 1 SRM + 6 GFTP.
	* Only Nodes on WAN (dual-homed): 1 Core + 1 SRM + 6 GFTP. 
	* Network: 6 GFTP nodes on 10GbE, 2 of which with 2 GFTP doors each.

	* 34 Tb, growing to ~60 later this year
	* 2 dCache infrastructure nodes
	* all workers on public address space
	* replication on (2 copies?)
	* second, smaller 4-node dCache installation used for development with <nowiki>LambdaStation</nowiki>

<b>Zhengping(Jane) Liu, Yingzi(Iris) Wu --- Brookhaven National Lab</b>

   * 150TB currently, phased growth ongoing
   * 350+ worker nodes (dCache pools)
[[%ATTACHURL%/dcacheIntro-7-17-2006][Power point presentation]]
Goal here is to present a layperson's view of how dCache works.
   * Network: 5 GFTP nodes with 2GFTP doors each on 10GbE, 
---+++ Walkthrough of dCache installation
 <b> Attendees: Please continue with details .. </b>
---+++ dCache performance tuning
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/dcacheIntro-7-17-2006][dCache Introduction]]
     Goal here is to present a layperson's view of how dCache works.

---+++ Walkthrough of dCache installation (moved to afternoon)

This is implemented as a cell in dCache, and we all have this installed by default. Unfortunately, none of us knows what to do with it.



---+++ New features coming within the next 6 months

---++++ gPLAZMA
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/gPlazma-Presentation.pdf][Deploying gPlazma dCache cell.]]
---++++ SRM v2.2
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/SRMTalk-DCache-Workshop-June17-2006.pdf][SRMTalk-DCache-Workshop-June17-2006.pdf]]: SRM V2.2 Implementation Status
---++++ other dCache features 

---+++ Operations Support Tools
Discussion of things people need, and what rudiments of these exist today.
Ideally, we'd "self-organize", and commit to contributing some tools,
and have others that we ask for from OSG Extensions.

---++++ OSG Registration
CMS Tier2 sites are currently required to register their storage elements with the GOC.  This allows them to appear in the GridCat catalog.  It would be nice if more OSG storage elements were registered with the GOC.  Registration is as simple as filling out a web form:
