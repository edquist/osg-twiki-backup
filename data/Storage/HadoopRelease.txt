---+++ Hadoop 0.20 Release

The Hadoop-0.20 OSG release involves a giant overhaul of how we package.  The highlights are:
   1 Switching to the CDH3 distribution.
   1 Switching to source RPMs from EPEL for all Globus components.
   1 Upgrade to bestman2 (which is the remaining non-source RPM).
   1 Using Koji to handle release engineering and mash to auto-create repos.
   1 Adding xrootd as a major component.
