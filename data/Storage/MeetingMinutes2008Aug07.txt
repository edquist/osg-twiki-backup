 <!-- DESCRIPTION -->

1. Ted & Abhishek presented the summary of blueprint meeting relevant to storage<br /><br />Abishek has promised to write a document where he would share UCSD experienced with configuration and tunning of dcache opportunistic storage.<br /> <br />2. Discussed what kind of performance tests should be done for bestMan/xrootd and<br />is it possible to compare performance of dcache & bestMan/xrootd .<br /><br />Alex and Ted didn't think that it would be a very meaningful comparison. Tanya has disagreed. She thought that it would be possible to compare performance of two storage installations for different workflow patterns. She will need to understand more about xrootd and will come up with examples for potential performance tests. Alex has promised to send the recent performance test results for xrootd.<br /><br />3. Discussed vdt installation of BeStMan/xrootd (will be "unsupported" software - without any configuration scripts for xrootd installation). Tanya mentioned that the xrootd.rpm refference in LBNL BeStMan webpage looks like obsolete rpm. Alex said that xrootd should be download from SLAC and all the questions should be send to Wei Yang. Tanya has got two nodes from CMS to install BeStMan/xrootd. She has installed only BeStMan and FUSE for now. Need help with xrootd configuration (hopefully Andrew will be able to help when he comes from vacation)<br /><br />4. Neha has presented her plan for osg twiki documentation layout. She will start to work on it soon. First area to clean up will be documentation for "End User"<br /><br />5.
