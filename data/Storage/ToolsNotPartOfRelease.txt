This page provides links to documentation of tools that people operating dCache production deployments
find useful, but are not part of the dCache release as it comes via the VDT.

---+++ Tools for file integrity checking
---++++ [[http://hepuser.ucsd.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/PnfsChecker][PNFS Monitoring System @ UCSD]]
   * The purpose of the system is to check for files that are in pnfs but not on disk, check the file integrity (i.e. checksum), and
      monitor the read performance, keeping track which pool the files were read from.
   * Note: The documentation at the above link is out of date! We switched from submitting condor jobs for the data read
     tests to cron jobs on all compute nodes. The documentation has not been updated to reflect this.
