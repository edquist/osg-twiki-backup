---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
bestman/hdfs rpms 

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Jeff was able to build rpms for  !BeStMan and !BeStMan2 and installed it locally. He is waiting for permission to be set up correctly to move all rpms to test repository. Jeff doesn't make any progress with documentation (he is having authorization problem with OSG twiki ). He should submit ticket to GOC.

Doug has reported that he encountered problems with mounting hdfs via fstab while testing https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HadoopInstallationHandsOn. The manual mount works fine. Michael and Jeff have confirmed that they experienced similar problems. We need to figure it out  before AHM.

Jeff has promised to update document to clarify some of the instructions.
---++ Second agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
RSV storage probes doc status

<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Tanya reviewed both documents written by Doug:
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/MonitoringInformation/RSV33StorageProbes
   * https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/RSVPigeonTools
Neha has finished testing of RSV/Pigeon doc and will work on the RSV storage probe testing.

---++ Fourth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
dcache 1.9.12
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Neha is doing survey in order  to figure out how many sites that are using dcache are actually depend on VDT installation, so far  6 sites  (out of 14) have responded and 3 of them including BNL are using vdt-dcache installation. She will continue to gather information.

---++ Fifth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
xrootd
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Tanya has continued testing xrootd 3.0.0 with FRM. In current configuration there are local and remote clusters and one global redirector. There were some problems during the test and Tanya is in contact with developers trying to debug the issue. We have also requested 5 nodes on FermiCloud in order to make test configuration more relevant.
