---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
bestman/hdfs rpms 

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Jeff was able to build rpms for  !BeStMan and !BeStMan2 and installed it locally. He is waiting for permission to be set up correctly to move all rpms to test repository. Jeff doesn't make any progress with documentation (he is having authorization problem with OSG twiki ). He should submit ticket to GOC.

Doug has reported that he has encountered problems with mounting hdfs via fstab while testing https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/HadoopInstallationHandsOn. The manual mount works fine. Michael and Jeff have confirmed that they have experienced similar problems. We need to figure out the reason before AHM.

Jeff has promised to update document to clarify some of the instructions.
