---+ Eileen's Suggestions for Storage Group Web Pages
July 11, 2006

hi, here are brainstorming type suggestions for the storage OSG
web pages.  i have not investigated all the web pages, so some or
more of this may already exist.  i think we should preserve the
look and feel of our web pages to match those of the other OSG
web pages.  this list below is meant to stimulate discussion,
not be exhaustive, correct, or organized.  information mentioned
below may in fact be included as a URL to the specific information.
i think it is good practice to not try to duplicate information.
also, how much of this can be integrated in with other OSG pages?
