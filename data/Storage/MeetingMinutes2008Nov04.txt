Several sites have installed BeStMan-gateway and xrootd, the feedback was incorporated into VDT. The documents related to installation and configuration are available.

---++ Fourth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
OSG Extension  

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Ted is planning to work on matchmaking between user jobs and sites that provide opportunistic storage advertised  by ReSS  assuming that VOInfoTag contains a space token information.

Tanya added "storage types" to  [[ https://osg-ress-2.fnal.gov:8443/test/osg_storage.jsp] [osg_storage.jsp]] so one can select a type (All, dCache, BeStMan) for a particular VO or Site. Based on information collected in BDII, we currently have 16 sites that provide "srm" storage (12 - dCache,4 - BeStMan). There are still a lot  of issues with GIP configuration on the sites that include invalid end point, invalid path, missing version, incorrect size of storage area.
