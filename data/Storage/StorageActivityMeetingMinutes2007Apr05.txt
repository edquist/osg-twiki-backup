---+++ Discussion

The <nop>EsNet telephone conferencing system malfunctioned again, so the meeting was held on the backup number. Two participants called in.

Three old and four new tickets were discussed. It was agreed that tickets that need to be handled by dCache developers would be assigned to a "dcache" user in the VDT ticket system and forwarded to the dcache ticket system.

SPRACE will upgrade their SRM-dCache installation and will be encouraged to use the VDT scripts.

Two issues regarding monitoring were discussed: whether glue schema info is being supplied and used correctly and whether the results will be displayed on the VirtualOrganizations/VOInfoRS web page. Neha will follow up with John Rosheck on both of these.

Ted Hesselroth reported that he has begun writing scripts to install SRM Watch throught the VDT package. Michael Zalokar will add a question to the dialog for this.

It was reported that at yesterday's dCache collaboration meeting, it was decided that Gregory Sharp would be given access to the dCache CVS repository in order to make improvements to logging code. Ted Hesselroth described recent industry work on the System Definition Model and suggested that it might be used to facilitate, among other things, logging.

dcache.org will host a wiki combined with a ticket system and subversion and stated the desire for a single forum site. Possible conversion of documents currently written in twiki format will be placed on hold. The alternative of dcache.org hosting a twiki was mentioned.

Ted Hesselroth announced that next week's meeting will be a "Chat with Developers" session.
