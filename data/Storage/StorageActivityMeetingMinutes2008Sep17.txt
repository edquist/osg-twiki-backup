1. Answered Marcia's questions about D0 usage of OSG opportunistic storage. Marcia is writing article for OSG.<br /><br />2. Discussed how to proceed with SBGrid. Abhishek described the current situation and his understanding of taskforce goals. Agreed that we will wait for requests from Jeff Porter before we could be actively involved. Alex should be able to login on the SBGrid BeStMan nodes.<br /><br />3. BeStMan-gateway/xrootd status. All components are installed and configured. VDT packages still need some improvements. The current installation is running on 4 nodes, with gums enabled for BeStMan and grdiftp . It is configured to use space tokens. Tanya is working on the document that describes the installation and configuration procedure for Tier-2, Tier-3<br /><br />4. Gratia probes for BeStMan. Brian is working on including srm-ping additional info into GIP but apparently nobody is working on gratia storage probes for BeStMan, the only information one could extract from srm-ping is a list existing tokens and the size of reserved spaces.<br />There is no information about available space and no dynamic information. Gratia transfer probes should extract information from GridFtp logs because BeStMan doesn't necessary know about transfer requests. It is unclear if anybody is interested in these probes and who will be able to implement that probe if needed. Alex has mentioned that CEDPS has done some work on parsing GridFtp logs...<br /><br />5. Two outstanding problems in Purdue and MIT. In Purdue the second attempt to copy file that had previously failed to be transferred and in MIT the second attempt to copy file that had been successfully copied and deleted are causing the same error "No write pools configured ...". It is an SRM problem and the bug was submitted to dcache developers. We can not reproduce this problem on test node (1.8.0-15p11). MIT and Purdue have 1.8.0-12p5 version.<br /><br />6. Ted is working in gPlazma/XACML , the new gPlazma should be released soon. It should be tested against new/old gums servers.<br /><br />7. Neha is wrapping up documentation clean up. She is s waiting for some information about gratia probes and doc about opportunistic storage configuration.<br /><br />8. Tickets:<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />New tickets <br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Follow up in progress:<br />5585 - File concatenation in dCache<br />5586 - Incorrect file size determination by srmls causing srmcp to fail<br />5587 - changing parent id of files in PNFS<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Old tickets <br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />Follow up in progress:<br />5402 - srmcp, srmping failure against BestMan SE<br />5540 - Missing directory tags in PNFS<br /><br />No update:<br />5401 - lcg-cp not accepting service certificate for srm server<br />5448 - gridftp door returning private ip address at Caltech<br />5542 - Directory creation unreliable using gridftp door<br />%ENDSECTION{name="ActionItemList" type="section"}%
