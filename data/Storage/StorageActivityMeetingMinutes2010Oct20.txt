BeStMan(2) & XACML testing with new privilege jars 

Testing for srm-client bug fixes for srm-mkdir exit code

Wrote script for LIGO Binary Inspiral that analyzes transfer list, identifies 
directory that should be created on remote SE and creates them. Britta has tested it and incorporated in workflow. 

Started discussion about remote participation in Brazilian Grid School Storage session

Modified/finished all BeStMan installation guides (BeStMan,BeStMan-Gateway,BeStMan on CE, BeStman/Xrootd)

---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Documentation

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
29 out of 38 documents under content control are released.  4 will be released soon (they are being modified after several rounds of review and testing). Hopefully, we will finish with all documents before 11/1/2010.

---++ Second agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
BeStMan and XACML

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Brian has reported that BeStMan2/XACML with privilege-xacml-2.2.4.jar that has been recently installed on production SE at Nebraska has apparent memory leak. Tanya can not reproduce it on teststand with light load running for several days. Ted has recommend to use  privilege-xacml-2.2.5.jar where the memory leak is supposedly fixed. We have installed it on our test node and run stress test. The memory utilization was pretty big but stable. While testing we have noticed that BeStMan2 is not caching certificate thus increase load on GUMS server. The developers have been notified and the new release is ready for testing. Tanya has talked to Alain about maintenance of privilege-xacml.jar and STG involvement.  

---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
SRM-LBNL client exit codes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
While helping Britta to run LIGO Binary Inspiral on more sites the inconsistency of the return code of srm-mkidr command has been discovered. The developers have provided several fixes. The latest tested fix has been installed on LIGO submission node and Britta was able to test the script we have provided for recursive directory creation.

---++ Forth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
RSV & RSV storage probes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

RSV now have rsv-control mechanism (similar to vdt-control), unfortunately it is not very convenient to use it for storage probes if several SEs should be tested. Doug is working with Scot to make all the probes working with new RSV. We hope that srm-tester probes will be released soon, it is still unclear if pigeons tools can be modified to work within current RSV framework.
