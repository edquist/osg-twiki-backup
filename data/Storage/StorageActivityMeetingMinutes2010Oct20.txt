BeStMan(2) & XACML testing with new privilege jars 

Testing for srm-client bug fixes for srm-mkdir exit code

Wrote script for LIGO Binary Inspiral that analyzes transfer list, identifies 
directory that should be created on remote SE and creates them. Britta has tested it and incorporated in the workflow. 

Started discussion about the remote participation/agenda in Brazilian Grid School Storage session

Modified/finished all BeStMan installation guides (BeStMan,BeStMan-Gateway,BeStMan on CE, BeStman/Xrootd)

---++ First agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
Documentation

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
29 out of 38 documents under content management  are released.  4 will be released soon (they are being modified after several rounds of review and testing). Hopefully, we will finish with all documents before 11/1/2010.

---++ Second agenda Item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
!BeStMan and XACML

---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->
Brian has reported that !BeStMan2/XACML with privilege-xacml-2.2.4.jar that has been recently installed on production SE at Nebraska has apparent memory leak. Tanya can not reproduce it on teststand under light load. The test was running for several days. Ted has recommend to use  privilege-xacml-2.2.5.jar where the memory leak is supposedly fixed. We have installed it on our test node and run stress test  with Haifeng help. The memory utilization was pretty big but stable. While testing we have noticed that !BeStMan2 is not caching certificates that caused heavy  load on GUMS server. The developers have been notified and the new release is ready for testing. Tanya has talked to Alain about maintenance of privilege-xacml.jar and STG involvement.  

---++ Third agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
SRM-LBNL client exit codes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->]
We have discovered srm-mkdir command  inconsistent  return codes  while helping Britta to modify/test her script. The developers have provided several fixes. The latest tested fix has been installed on LIGO submission node and Britta was able to test the script we have provided for recursive directory creation.

---++ Forth agenda item
<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
RSV & RSV storage probes
---+++ Discussion
<!-- describe the discussion that took place -->

RSV now have rsv-control mechanism (similar to vdt-control). Unfortunately it is not very convenient  for configuring storage probes when several SEs should be tested. Doug is working with Scot to make all the storage probes working with new RSV. We hope that srm-tester probes will be released soon. It is still unclear if pigeons tools can be modified to work within current RSV framework.
