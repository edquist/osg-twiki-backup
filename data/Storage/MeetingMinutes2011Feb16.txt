Finally got response from all (but one) OSG dCache SE admins on dCache upgrade downtime (15 min -> 3/4 day)
- Released VDT-dCache 3.0.4 in production
- Notified OSG sites about upcoming dCache workshop
- Sent survey to all OSG dCache admins wrt SL4 support for gratia dcache probes. No SL4 support is needed anymore for these probes.
- Tried to build new dCache storage and transfer probe rpms for latest gratia probe release - 1.07.01a-2.src.rpm on SL5. 
Build failed again due to dependency on python-setuptools. Sent mail to Brian/Philippe
- Request DN change in OIM so I could update tickets
- Working on dCache tickets from 2010. So far went through and fixed the report sent by
   GOC and looked up the support person for each ticket in it.
