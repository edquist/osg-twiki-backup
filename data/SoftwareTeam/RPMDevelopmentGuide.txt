---+ RPM Development Guide
%TOC%

This page documents technical guidelines and details about RPM development for the OSG Software Stack. The procedures, conventions, and policies defined within are used by the OSG Software Team, and are recommended to all external developers who wish to contribute to the OSG Software Stack.

%RED%Status:%ENDCOLOR% Mid-December 2011: needs review

---++ Principles

The principles below guide the design and implementation of the technical details that follow.

   * Packages should adhere to community standards (e.g., [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingGuidelines][Fedora Packaging Guidelines]]) when possible, and significant deviations must be documented
   * Every released package must be reproducible from data stored in our system
   * Source code for software should be clearly separable from the packaging of that software
   * Upstream source files (which should not be modified) should be clearly separated from files owned by the OSG Software Team
   * Building source and binary packages from our system should be easy and efficient
   * External developers should have a clear and effective system for developing and contributing packages
   * We should use standard tools from relevant packaging and development communities when appropriate

---++ Contributing Packages

We encourage all interested parties to contribute to OSG Software, and all the infrastructure described on this page should be friendly to external contributors.

*However*, not all of the infrastructure is in place yet: you must gather a few authorizations. We will be working to decrease the extra steps necessary.

   * To participate in the packaging community: You must subscribe to the osg-software@opensciencegrid.org email list. Subscribing to an OSG email list is [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/users.asp#subscribe%20to%20list][described here]].
   * To create and edit packages: [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/internal/svn.html][Obtain access to VDT SVN]].
   * To upload new source tarballs: You must have a cs.wisc.edu account with write access to the VDT source tarball directory. Email the osg-software list and request permission.

---++ Development Infrastructure

This section documents most of what a developer needs to know about our RPM infrastructure:

   * Upstream Source Cache — a filesystem scheme for caching upstream source files
   * Revision Control System — where to get and store development files, and how they are organized
   * Build System — how to build packages from the revision control system
   * Development Tools — other tools to aid development
   * Yum Repository — the location and organization of our Yum repository, and how to promote packages through it

---+++ Upstream Source Cache

One of our principles (every released package must be reproducible from data stored in our system) creates a potential issue: If we keep all historical source data, especially upstream files like source tarballs and source RPMs, in our revision control system, we may face large checkouts and consequently long checkout and update times.

Our solution is to cache all upstream source files in a separate filesystem area, retaining historical files indefinitely. To avoid tainting upstream files, our policy is to leave them unmodified after download.

Now that we build RPMs in koji, it is considered the authoritative location for source files we have released packages from.

---++++ Locating Files in the Cache

Upstream source files are stored in the filesystem as follows:

<blockquote><code><em>%GREEN%prefix%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%version%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%file%ENDCOLOR%</em></code></blockquote>

where:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Definition* | *Example* |
| <code><em>%GREEN%prefix%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Filesystem prefix, the base location of the upstream source cache | At Madison: =/p/vdt/public/html/upstream= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Upstream name of the source package, or some widely accepted form thereof | =ndt= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%version%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Upstream version string used to identify the release | =3.6.4= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%file%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Upstream filename itself (unless filename conflicts force a change, which should be exceedingly rare) | =ndt-3.6.4.tar.gz= |

The authoritative cache is the VDT webserver, which is fully backed up. Other developers can create a local cache for efficient development.

Upstream source files are referenced from within the revision control system; see below for details.

---++++ Contributing Upstream Files

If you are using a local cache during development, you must make sure that any new upstream source files are cached on the VDT webserver before declaring the package to be ready for testing. You have two options:

   * If you have access to a UW–Madison CSL machine, you can scp the source files directly into the AFS locations using that machine
   * If you do not have such access, write to the osg-software list to find someone who will post the files for you

---+++ Revision Control System

All packages that the OSG Software Team releases are checked into our revision control system (currently Subversion but with the option to change at a later date).

---++++ Subversion Access

Our Subversion repository is located at:

<blockquote><pre>https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn</pre></blockquote>

[[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/internal/svn.html][Procedure for offsite users obtaining access to Subversion]]

Or, from a UW–Madison Computer Sciences machine:

<blockquote><pre>file:///p/condor/workspaces/vdt/svn</pre></blockquote>

The current SVN directory housing our work-in-progress native package work is =$repo/native= (where =$repo= is one of the ways of accessing our SVN repository above). For example, to check out the current Subversion repository via https, do:

<pre class="screen">svn co https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/native</pre>

---++++ OSG-Owned Software

OSG-owned software goes into Subversion as follows:

<blockquote><code>software/<em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%section%ENDCOLOR%</em></code></blockquote>

where:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Definition* | *Example* |
| <code><em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Our name for the software package | =vdt-system-profiler= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%section%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Development section | Standard Subversion sections like =trunk=, =branches/*=, and =tags/*= |

Within a section directory, files are organized as the developer sees fit.

It is strongly recommended that each software package include a top-level Makefile with at least the following targets:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Purpose* |
| =install= | Install the software into final FHS locations rooted at =DESTDIR= |
| =dist= | Create a distribution source tarball (in the current section directory) for a release |
| =upstream= | Install the distribution source tarball into the upstream source cache (default to VDT AFS, but override the upstream root with =UPSTREAM= |

---++++ Packaging Top-Level Directory Organization

The top levels of our Subversion directory hierarchy for packaging are as follows:

<blockquote><code>native/<em>%GREEN%os%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%section%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em></code></blockquote>

where:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Definition* | *Example* |
| <code><em>%GREEN%os%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Major operating system release | =redhat= (only supported value, currently) |
| <code><em>%GREEN%section%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Development section | Standard Subversion sections like =trunk=, =branches/*=, and =tags/*= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Our standardized name for a source package | =ndt= |

---++++ Package Directory Organization

Within a source package directory, the following files (detailed in separate sections below) may exist:

| =README= | text file | package notes, by and for developers |
| =upstream/= | directory | references to the upstream source cache and other kinds of upstream files |
| =osg/= | directory | overrides and patches of upstream files, plus new files, which contribute to the final OSG source package |
| =_upstream_srpm_contents/= | generated directory (not under revision control) | expanded contents of a cached upstream source package |
| =_upstream_tarball_contents/= | generated directory (not under revision control) | expanded contents of all cached upstream source tarballs |
| =_final_srpm_contents/= | generated directory (not under revision control) | the final contents of the OSG source package |
| =_build_results/= | generated directory (not under revision control) | OSG source and binary packages resulting from a build |

---+++++ README

This is a free-form text file for developers to leave notes about the package. Please document anything interesting about how you procured the upstream source, the reasons for the modifications you made, or anything else people might need to know in order to maintain the package in the future. Please document the _why_, not just the _what_.

---+++++ upstream

Within the per-package directories of the revision control system, there must be a way to refer to cached files. This is done with small text files that (a) are named consistently, and (b) contain the location of the referenced file as its contents.

A reference file is named:

<blockquote><code><em>%GREEN%description%ENDCOLOR%</em>.<em>%GREEN%type%ENDCOLOR%</em>.source</code></blockquote>

where:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Definition* | *Example* |
| <code><em>%GREEN%description%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Descriptive label of the source of the referenced file | =developer=, =epel=, =emi= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%type%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Type of referenced file | Use: =tarball=, =srpm= |

The contents of the file match the upstream source cache path defined above, without the prefix component:

<blockquote><code><em>%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%version%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%file%ENDCOLOR%</em></code></blockquote>

This way, the command-line tools that use the =.source= files can be given different prefixes for different build situations.

For example, the reference file for NDT’s source tarball is named =developer.tarball.source= and might contain:

<blockquote><code>ndt/3.6.4/ndt-3.6.4.tar.gz</code></blockquote>

The =.source= files may contain comments, which start with <code>#</code> and continue until the end of the line.

---+++++ osg

The =osg= directory contains files that are owned by the OSG Software Team and that are used to create the final, released source package. It may contain a variety of development files:

   * An RPM =.spec= file, which overrides any spec file from a referenced source
   * Patch (=.patch=) or replacement files, which override any same-named file from the top-level directory of a referenced source
   * Other files, which must be explicitly placed into the package by the spec file

---+++++ _upstream_srpm_contents

The =_upstream_srpm_contents= directory contains the files that are part of the upstream source package. It is generated by the package build tool and is a volatile record of the upstream source for developer use. This directory is excluded from Subversion commits.

---+++++ _upstream_tarball_contents

The =_upstream_tarball_contents= directory contains the files that are part of the upstream source tarballs. It is generated by the package build tool if and only if the =--full-extract= option is passed. It is not used for anything by the build tool, but meant as a convenience to allow the developer to look inside the upstream sources (for making patches, etc.). This directory is excluded from Subversion commits.

---+++++ _final_srpm_contents

The =_final_srpm_contents= directory contains the final files that are part of the released source package. It is generated by the package build tool and is a volatile record of a build for developer use. This directory is excluded from Subversion commits.

---+++++ _build_results

The =_build_results= directory contains the source and binary RPMs that are produced by a local build. The directory is generated by the package build tool and is a volatile record of a build for developer use. It is excluded from Subversion commits.

---+++++ Use Case 1: Packaging Our Own Code

When the OSG Software Team contributes all of the files for a package, they are located in the =software= project area. The =Makefile= therein creates an upstream source tarball in the standard location. All that remains is to define a =.source= reference to the upstream source tarball, and a =.spec= file. For example, the OSG Software Team provides a debugging utility called <code>vdt-system-profiler</code> to collect system information that can be sent to the OSG Software Team to aid in debugging. Its =software= directory contains:

<blockquote>
<pre>
vdt-system-profiler/
    Makefile
    vdt-system-profiler
</pre>
</blockquote>

Its packaging directory contains:

<blockquote>
<pre>
vdt-system-profiler/
    osg/
        vdt-system-profiler.spec
    upstream/
        vdt.tarball.source
</pre>
</blockquote>

---+++++ Use Case 2: Packaging an Upstream Source Tarball

When the OSG Software Team packages an upstream source tarball, for which there is no existing package, the source tarball is referenced with a .source file and we provide a spec file and, if necessary, patches. For example, RSV is provided as a source tarball only. Its package directory contains:

<blockquote>
<pre>
osg-rsv/
    osg/
        osg-rsv.spec
    upstream/
        developer.tarball.source
</pre>
</blockquote>

---+++++ Use Case 3: Passing Through a Source RPM

When the OSG Software Team simply provides a copy of an existing source RPM, it is referenced with a .source file and that is it. For example, we do not modify the xrootd source RPM from EMI. Its package directory contains:

<blockquote>
<pre>
xrootd/
    upstream/
        developer.srpm.source
</pre>
</blockquote>

---+++++ Use Case 4: Modifying a Source RPM

When the OSG Software Team modifies an existing source RPM, it is referenced with a .source file and then all changes to the upstream source are contained in the <code>osg</code> directory. For example, *if we were to ship a modified Apache HTTPD webserver package,* we would use this mechanism. Its package directory contains:

<blockquote><pre>
apache/
    osg/
        httpd.spec
        vdt-apachectl.patch
    upstream/
        epel.srpm.source
</pre></blockquote>

---+++ Build Process

We use the standard RPM build tools such as =rpmbuild=, =mock=, and =koji= with our own wrapper scripts around them.

---++++ Officially Supported Packages

   1. All necessary information to create the package will be committed to the VDT source code repository (see below)
   1. A tool is provided that will take those files, create a source RPM, and submit it to a build system; currently we support three underlying build systems:
      * rpmbuild
      * mock
      * koji

Official builds will be done with Koji, but contributors can use options 1 or 2 to develop a package before contributing it to the OSG Software Stack.

---++++ Unsupported Contributed Packages

Unsupported contributed packages have two build options. They will be provided via a separate yum repository for unsupported contributions.

   1. Build exactly like the supported packages (above). 
   1. The RPM can be built by the contributor in their own environment and shared with the OSG Software Team for manual staging into the yum repository. 

Should we support Koji in the future, we'll allow Koji submissions for trusted contributors. 

---++++ Build Tools

The main build tools can be checked out from SVN, under =software/osg-build/trunk=, or installed from the =osg-build= RPM in the =osg-development= repository.
See [[SoftwareTeam.OSGBuildTools][instructions on how to use the OSG build tools]]

---+++ OSG Software Repository

The GOC maintains the Yum repositories that contain our source and binary RPMs.
The repositories are mirrored at other institutions as well.
The repositories are hosted on <code>http://repo.grid.iu.edu</code> and is organized in the following fashion:

<blockquote><code>http://repo.grid.iu.edu/<em>%GREEN%osg-level%ENDCOLOR%</em>/<em>%GREEN%architecture%ENDCOLOR%</em>/*.rpm</code></blockquote>

where:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Definition* | *Example* |
| <code><em>%GREEN%osg-level%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Release level of the package (see below) | =osg-development=, =osg-testing=, =osg-production=, =osg-contrib= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%architecture%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Architecture of the built packages | =i386=, =x86_64=, =source= |

In addition, once we start having multiple major-minor versions of the VDT, and supporting multiple OS releases, we will need to reorganize the repositories to include the following information:

%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Symbol* | *Definition* | *Example* |
| <code><em>%GREEN%version%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Major-minor version of the VDT | =3.0= |
| <code><em>%GREEN%os%ENDCOLOR%</em></code> | Major operating system release for which packages were built | =el5=, =el6= |


---++++ Release Levels

Every package is classified into a release level based on the amount of testing it has undergone and our confidence in its stability. When a package is first built, it goes into the lowest level (=osg-development=). Only members of the OSG Software Team may promote packages upward through the release levels.

See the [[SoftwareTeam.ReleasePolicy][Release Policy page]] for more info.

---++++ Package Signing

Packages are signed automatically by Koji after a non-scratch build.

---++ Packaging Conventions

In addition to adhering to the [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/PackagingGuidelines][Fedora Packaging Guidelines]] (FPG), we have a few rules and guidelines of our own:

   * When we pass-through an RPM and make any changes to it (so it has an updated package number), we construct the version-release as follows:
      * The version of the original RPM remains unchanged.
      * The release is composed of three parts: ORIGINALRELEASE.OSGRELEASE
      * We add the 'osg' distro tag. (Use =%{?dist}= in the Release field)
Example: We copy package foobar-3.0.5-1 from somewhere. We need to patch it, so the full name-version-release (NVR) becomes =foobar-3.0.5-1%RED%.1.osg%ENDCOLOR%= That is, we added ".1.osg" to the release number. If we update our packaging (but still base on foobar-3.0.5-1), we change to ".2.osg". In the spec file, this would look like: <pre class="file">
Release: 1.2%{?dist}
</pre>
   * %RED% We may require packages that do not meet all FPG guidelines to install a file (perhaps in <code>/usr/share/doc/%GREEN%package%ENDCOLOR%/</code>) that documents major deviations from the guidelines that may be significant to end users.%ENDCOLOR%
   * %RED% We should probably provide a more user-level README file in /usr/share/doc/package as well, if a package doesn't come with some form of documentation.%ENDCOLOR%
   * Java-based software must be packaged according to our [[JavaPackageNotes][Java packaging policy]].

---++ External RPM Repositories

---+++ EPEL & Globus

We tell our users that they have to use/enable the EPEL repository.
We also tell our uses that they use the =yum-priorities= plugin to make sure that our packages override packages from EPEL, in case we modify any packages.

We currently ship Globus ourselves, though our packages are based on the SRPMs that the Globus team provides (that were originally built for EPEL).
This is because at the time of this writing, EPEL was shipping a version of Globus 5.0 that we considered unusable, so we started shipping 5.2 prereleases instead.


---+++ EMI

EMI 1.0 is very new. We expect to use many of their packages, but we will prefer to copy the packages to our repository instead of relying directly on the EMI repository. This will allow us to control the versions of the critical grid software our stakeholders need.

If you report bugs to EMI, you can use [[https://ggus.eu/pages/home.php][GGUS]]. Please note a few things:

   1. Please copy Alain on the ticket so he can be aware of what's happening with all of our bug reports to EMI.
   1. If you think the ticket affects other people in the group, please send a note about it to osg-software@opensciencegrid.org. 
   1. You should put "EMI" in the _short description_ and something like "Please assign to EMI Release Management" in the _description_.
