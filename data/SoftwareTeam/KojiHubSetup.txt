---+!! Notes on Koji-Hub Setup

%TOC%

---++ Machine setup

koji is run on =koji.chtc.wisc.edu=; right now a single machine is used for the hub (koji-hub), the web frontend (koji-web), repo generation (kojira), and el5 building (kojid).
A second machine, =kojibuilder1.batlab.org= is used for el6 building.

As instructions for setting up the machine, I'm just going to take the Fedora guide at [[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji/ServerHowTo]], and add modifications / comments to suit our setup.

<blockquote>
* For an overview of yum, mock, Koji (and all its subcomponents), mash,
and how they all work together, see the excellent slides put together
by Steve Traylen at CERN http://indico.cern.ch/event/55091
</blockquote>
---+++ Packages to install

<blockquote>
*On the server (koji-hub/koji-web)*
   * httpd
   * mod_ssl
   * postgresql-server
   * mod_python (&gt;= 3.3.1 for Kerberos authentication)

*On the builder (koji-builder)*
   * mock
   * setarch (for some archs you'll require a patched version)
   * rpm-build
   * createrepo
</blockquote>
We use one machine for both these roles, so all of the above has to be installed.

The koji packages to install are:
   * koji-hub
   * koji-web
   * koji-builder
   * koji-utils

---+++ Filesystems
<blockquote>
---++++!! A note on filesystem space
Koji will consume copious amounts of disk space under the primary !KojiDir directory (as set in the kojihub.conf file).
</blockquote>
This is =/mnt/koji= by default. Koji keeps _all RPMs built_ in here so a complete history is kept.
In addition, repositories are kept here.
A repository is just a set of text files, but since a new one is generated for every build, the space will add up.
Koji does clean up the repositories once they get old enough.
For =koji.chtc.wisc.edu=, we allocated a 120G partition for =/mnt/koji=.

<blockquote>
However, as koji makes use of mock on the backend to actually create build roots and perform the builds in those build roots, it might come to a surprise to users that a running koji server will consume large amounts of disk space under /var/lib/mock and /var/cache/mock as well.
</blockquote>
=kojid= (the builder daemon) will refuse to start a build if it does not have sufficient space under =/var/lib/mock=.
By default, this is an 8G surplus, but we lowered it to 4G for =koji.chtc.wisc.edu=.
The build roots will be wiped after successful builds, but the build roots for failed builds will be kept around for 2 weeks (?); as a result, disk usage of =/var/lib/mock= can swing wildly.
For =koji.chtc.wisc.edu=, we have allocated 35G for =/var/lib/mock=.
=/var/cache/mock= doesn't use up that much space, so we didn't make a separate partition for it, it just uses what's under =/=.

---+++ Authentication
Most of the "Koji Authentication Selection" section can be skipped.
We got our certs from !DigiCert. *Note* that certs are sensitive to line ending issues -- you may have to run =dos2unix= on them before they would work.

We have 3 certs, with the following subjects:
   * <code>/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=koji.chtc.wisc.edu</code> (for koji-hub, koji-web, and kojid)
   * <code>/DC=org/DC=opensciencegrid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=kojira/koji.chtc.wisc.edu</code> (for kojira)
   * =/DC=com/DC=DigiCert-Grid/O=Open Science Grid/OU=Services/CN=kojibuilder1.batlab.org= (for kojid on kojibuilder1)
kojid needed a different cert than kojira because the two would connect to koji-hub at the same time and log each other off.

Copies of the certs exist in AFS at =/p/condor/home/certificates/koji.chtc.wisc.edu/= and =/p/condor/home/certificates/kojibuilder1.batlab.org/=

Clients connecting to koji-hub need a file containing the CA certs; this is just a concatenation of the !DigiCert Grid Root CA and the !DigiCert Grid CA-1 certs, which can be obtained from !DigiCert's website (get PEM format).
We have a =digicert-chain.crt= in =/etc/pki/tls/certs/digicert-chain.crt= on =koji-hub=

We made a =kojiadmin= user, but we didn't make a cert for it so we just used user/pass authentication until we set up our own accounts and then disabled =kojiadmin=.

---++++!! NEW: Using proxy certs

=/etc/sysconfig/httpd= needed to be changed to include the following lines:
<verbatim>
OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY=1
OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS=1

export OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY
export OPENSSL_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS
</verbatim>

The user must use RFC proxies and must have a version of the koji client of 1.6.0-6.osg or newer.

---+++ Postgres Database

   * Install postgres: <pre>root@koji-hub# yum install postgresql-server</pre>
   * Init the db: <pre>root@koji-hub# su - postgres -c "PGDATA=/var/lib/pgsql/data" initdb</pre>
   * Start the db: <pre>root@koji-hub# service postgresql start</pre>
   * Make a koji account: <pre>root@koji-hub# useradd koji; passwd -d koji</pre>
<blockquote>
---++++!! Setup !PostgreSQL and populate schema:

The following commands will create the =koji= user within !PostgreSQL and will then create the koji database using the schema within the =/usr/share/doc/koji*/docs/schema.sql= directory
<pre>
root@localhost$ su - postgres
postgres@localhost$ createuser koji
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
postgres@localhost$ createdb -O koji koji
postgres@localhost$ logout
root@localhost$ su - koji
koji@localhost$ psql koji koji < /usr/share/doc/koji*/docs/schema.sql
koji@localhost$ exit
</pre>

*NOTE:* When issuing the command to import the psql schema into the new database it is important to ensure that the directory path =/usr/share/doc/koji*/docs/schema.sql= remains intact and is not resolved to a specific version of koji.
In test it was discovered that when the path is resolved to a specific version of koji then not all of the tables were created correctly.
</blockquote>

To authorize the koji-web and koji-hub resources, make the following additions to =/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf= (IP addresses will vary):
<pre>
# access for koji
host    koji        postgres    127.0.0.1/32          trust
host    koji        koji        127.0.0.1/32          trust
host    koji        koji        128.104.100.41/32     trust
host    koji        koji        ::1/128               trust
</pre>

Next, we'll need a koji admin user to run some commands.
We'll need to add it to the database manually.
Once again, we used user/pass authentication for the kojiadmin user until we disabled it.
All database commands should be done as the =koji= user:<pre>root@koji-hub# sudo -u koji psql</pre>
<pre>
koji=> insert into users (name, password, status, usertype) values \
('kojiadmin', 'some-throwaway-admin-password-in-plain-text', 0, 0);
koji=> insert into user_perms (user_id, perm_id, creator_id) values \
((select id from users where name='kojiadmin'), 1, \
(select id from users where name='kojiadmin'));
</pre>

---+++ Koji-Hub

<blockquote>
Koji-hub is the center of all Koji operations.
It is an XML-RPC server running under mod_python in Apache.
koji-hub is passive in that it only receives XML-RPC calls and relies upon the build daemons and other components to initiate communication.
Koji-hub is the only component that has direct access to the database and is one of the two components that have write access to the file system.
</blockquote>

Config files we care about:
   * =/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf=
   * =/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojihub.conf=
   * =/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf=
   * =/etc/koji-hub/hub.conf=
Install the necessary packages. <pre>root@koji-hub# yum install koji-hub httpd mod_ssl mod_python</pre>

<blockquote>
---++++!! /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:

The apache web server has two places that it sets maximum requests a server will handle before the server restarts.
The xmlrpc interface in kojihub is a python application, and mod_python can sometimes grow outrageously large when it doesn't reap memory often enough.
As a result, it is strongly recommended that you set both instances of !MaxRequestsPerChild in =httpd.conf= to something reasonable in order to prevent the server from becoming overloaded and crashing (at 100 the =httpd= processes will grow to about 75MB resident set size before respawning).

<verbatim>
<IfModule prefork.c>
...
MaxRequestsPerChild  100
</IfModule>
<IfModule worker.c>
...
MaxRequestsPerChild  100
</IfModule>
</verbatim>

---++++!! /etc/koji-hub/hub.conf:

This file contains the configuration information for the hub.
You will need to edit this configuration to point Koji Hub to the database you are using and to setup Koji Hub to utilize the authentication scheme you selected in the beginning.
</blockquote>
We made multiple changes to this config file.
A snapshot is be attached to this page.

Notable changes:
   * We turned off =LoginCreatesUser=
   * =KojiWebURL= is http://koji.chtc.wisc.edu/koji
   * =PluginPath= is =/usr/lib/koji-hub-plugins=
   * =Plugins = sign= since there is an RPM signing plugin (package name: =koji-plugin-sign=) that we use

Other notes:
   * Should not be world-readable
   * Must be readable by the apache user though

Finally, there is a =[policy]= section for controlling ACLs.
The contents of that are described later in this document.

<blockquote>
---++++!! /etc/httpd/conf.d/kojihub.conf:
If using SSL auth, uncomment these lines for kojiweb to allow logins.
<verbatim>
<Location /kojihub>
SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
</Location>
</verbatim>
</blockquote>
This is actually outdated information, useful for Koji &lt; 1.4.0.
Instead, we add the following:

<verbatim>
<Location /kojihub/ssllogin>
        SSLVerifyClient require
        SSLVerifyDepth  10
        SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
</Location>
</verbatim>

<blockquote>
---++++!! /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf:
If using SSL you will also need to add the needed SSL options for apache.
These options should point to where the certificates are located on the hub.
</blockquote>

These are the config lines we use:
<pre>SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/digicert_hostcert.crt</pre>
The host cert for koji-hub.
<pre>SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/digicert_hostkey.key</pre>
The private key for koji-hub.
<pre>SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/digicert-chain.crt</pre>
The concatenation of the !DigiCert CA certs we made above.
<pre>SSLCACertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt</pre>
All the CA certs on the system.
<pre>
SSLVerifyClient require
SSLVerifyDepth  10
</pre>
Restart apache after doing this ( =service restart httpd= )

---++++ Adding a real admin user

At this point, SSL should be set up on Koji Hub.
Create an account for yourself (your DN): <pre>koji add-user 'Your Name 123456'</pre>
Give yourself the admin bit.<pre>koji grant-permission admin 'Your Name 123456'</pre>

*Once you're done with all the setup*, you should remove the admin bit from =kojiadmin=, block the user, and remove its password from the database.
<pre>koji revoke-permission admin kojiadmin
koji disable-user kojiadmin</pre>
In the database:
<pre>update users set password = null where name='kojiadmin';</pre>

---++++ Koji filesystem

=KojiDir= is =/mnt/koji=, so the following tree should be created:
<pre>
root@koji-hub$ mkdir -p /mnt/koji/{packages,repos,work,scratch}
root@koji-hub$ chown apache:apache *
</pre>

=/etc/koji.conf= is attached.

---++++ Accounts for kojira and kojid

<blockquote>
It is important to note that the kojira component needs repo privileges, but if you just let the account get auto created the first time you run kojira, it won't have that privilege, so you should pre-create the account and grant it the repo privilege now.

<pre>
kojiadmin@koji-hub$ koji add-user kojira
kojiadmin@koji-hub$ koji grant-permission repo kojira
</pre>

For similar technical reasons, you need to add-host each build host prior to starting kojid on that host the first time and could also do that now.
</blockquote>
We turned off auto account creation, so there won't be a problem with accounts with bad perms getting created.
Still, they have to be created manually.
We have kojid running on koji-hub, so this is the command we used to add it:
<pre>
kojiadmin@koji-hub$ koji add-host koji.chtc.wisc.edu i386 x86_64
</pre>

---+++ Koji-Web

Installing:
<pre>
root@koji-hub$ yum install koji-web mod_ssl
</pre>

Configuration:
=/etc/httpd/conf.d/kojiweb.conf= is attached.

---+++ Kojid

Installing:
<pre>
root@koji-hub$ yum install koji-builder
</pre>
Note that we use a patched koji-builder, so be sure to install what's in the OSG repository. (The patch is not likely to be accepted upstream).

=/etc/kojid/kojid.conf= is attached.

---++++ SSL certs

The following files should be in the =/etc/pki/tls= tree:

   $ =/etc/pki/tls/private/digicert_hostkey.key=: the host key from !DigiCert
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/private/kojiweb.pem=: digicert_hostcert.crt catted together with digicert_hostkey.key (public key first)
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/private/kojira.key=: kojira's private key from !DigiCert
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/private/kojira.pem=: kojira.crt catted together with kojira.key (public key first)
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem=: symlink to certs/ca-bundle.crt
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt=: all certs available on the system; the !DigiCert Grid certs should be in here
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/certs/kojira.crt=: kojira's cert
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/certs/digicert_hostcert.crt=: the host cert from !DigiCert
   $ =/etc/pki/tls/certs/digicert-chain.crt=: the !DigiCert CAs catted together

---++++ Adding koji-builder host to database
<pre>
kojiadmin@koji-hub$ koji add-host-to-channel koji.chtc.wisc.edu createrepo
</pre>

<pre>
koji=># update host set capacity = 4 where name = 'koji.chtc.wisc.edu';
</pre>

---++++ Start kojid
<pre>
root@koji-hub$ /sbin/service kojid start
</pre>
Check =/var/log/kojid.log= to make sure everything started up.

---+++ Kojira

Installing:
<pre>
root@koji-hub$ yum install koji-utils
</pre>
=/etc/kojira/kojira.conf= is attached.

Kojira also needs a user
<pre>
kojiadmin@koji-hub$ koji add-user kojira
kojiadmin@koji-hub$ koji grant-permission repo kojira
</pre>

Start it up
<pre>
root@koji-hub$ /sbin/service kojira start
</pre>

---++ Tags

---+++ Base tags

---++++ dist-build
Tags: =dist-el5-build= =dist-el6-build=

These tags contains 3 external repos each:
   $ dist-el[56]-epel: A local mirror of the EPEL 5/6 repositories. (url: http://mirror.batlab.org/pub/linux/epel/[56]/$arch/)
   $ dist-el[56]-centos: A local mirror of the base CentOS repositories. (url: http://mirror.batlab.org/pub/linux/centos/[56]/os/$arch/)
   $ dist-el[56]-centos-updates: A local mirror of the CentOS Updates repositories. (url: http://mirror.batlab.org/pub/linux/centos/[56]/updates/$arch/)
We don't put any packages in them (except for ones required for building, like =buildsys-macros= and =fetch-sources=), and generally don't build from them directly, but use tag inheritance.

---++++ osg-*
Tags: =osg-el5= =osg-el6=

These tags contains all the _package names_ that we put into OSG; =koji add-pkg= adds to them. (osg-build does this automatically).
The tags do not actually contain any builds (i.e. packages with version-release).
All the other osg tags inherit from these (either directly or indirectly).
The purpose of this is to make promoting builds easier, since it keeps you from having to run =add-pkg= when you promote.

---++++ kojira-fake
This tag (and targets building to it) were created because kojira does not automatically regenerate a repo unless it's the source of another repo.
Without this, the osg-development tags (for example) wouldn't get regenerated automatically after a build.

---+++ Main OSG tags

---++++ osg-build
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2 upcoming){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-build="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-build= =osg-3.1-el6-build= =osg-3.2-el5-build= =osg-3.2-el6-build= =osg-upcoming-el5-build= =osg-upcoming-el6-build=

These are used to initialize the buildroot of most packages we make.
They inherit from their respective dist-build and osg-development tags.
They also contain the jpackage[56]-bin external repos (url: http://mirror.batlab.org/pub/jpackage/[56]/) since we use those for some builds.
*Note* that the jpackage external repos must have a better priority than the os and epel external repos to avoid build problems for Java packages.

The upcoming-build tags are special in that they also need to inherit from the latest mainline osg-build repo (that is, if trunk is 3.2, then osg-upcoming-el5-build should inherit from osg-3.2-el5-build).

---++++ osg-development
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2 upcoming){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-development="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-development= =osg-3.1-el6-development= =osg-3.2-el5-development= =osg-3.2-el6-development= =osg-upcoming-el5-development= =osg-upcoming-el6-development=

These contain the builds in the osg-minefield repos.
The osg-development repos hosted by the GOC take packages from this, so osg-development is pretty much osg-minefield after a 30-min delay.
They inherit from osg-testing (and occasionally from the more specialized branches like el5-gt52-experimental, though that is now discouraged).
Builds that are made using the osg-el[56] targets (default if you're using osg-build) get their buildroots from the newest osg-build tags and put their results in the newest osg-development tags.
These are currently osg-3.2-el[56]-build and osg-3.2-el[56]-development.

---++++ osg-testing
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2 upcoming){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-testing="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-testing= =osg-3.1-el6-testing= =osg-3.2-el5-testing= =osg-3.2-el6-testing= =osg-upcoming-el5-testing= =osg-upcoming-el6-testing=

These contain the builds in the osg-testing repos.
They inherit from the respective osg-release tags.

---++++ osg-prerelease
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2 upcoming){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-prerelease="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-prerelease= =osg-3.1-el6-prerelease= =osg-3.2-el5-prerelease= =osg-3.2-el6-prerelease= =osg-upcoming-el5-prerelease= =osg-upcoming-el6-prerelease=

These are a staging are for packages that we are _certain_ will be released in the upcoming release.
They are otherwise empty.
These are used for testing and for building the tarball clients.

---++++ osg-release
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2 upcoming){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-release="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-release= =osg-3.1-el6-release= =osg-3.2-el5-release= =osg-3.2-el6-release= =osg-upcoming-el5-release= =osg-upcoming-el6-release=

These contain the builds in the osg-release repos.
They should be locked except for when moving packages from the osg-prerelease repos to the osg-release repos.
They inherit from osg-el[56].

---++++ osg-contrib
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-contrib="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-contrib= =osg-3.1-el6-contrib= =osg-3.2-el5-contrib= =osg-3.2-el6-contrib=

These contain the builds in the osg-contrib repos.
Note that there are no osg-upcoming-contrib repos.

---++++ osg-release-build
<!--
for $ov qw(3.1 3.2){for $el qw(el5 el6){print " =osg-$ov-$el-release-build="}}
-->
Tags: =osg-3.1-el5-release-build= =osg-3.1-el6-release-build= =osg-3.2-el5-release-build= =osg-3.2-el6-release-build=

These tags inherit from the osg-release and dist-build tags.
This results in repositories that we can completely initialize a system with, including the OS packages, without need for yum priorities.
They were originally created for Tony Tiradani, but are also used in creating the non-root/tarball client tarballs.
Note again that there are no release-build repos for upcoming.

---+++ Specialized tags

These tags are generally made for long projects which may be in an unstable state and should not interfere with the main development of OSG packages.
An example is a full-scale Globus update, where many packages have to be built, using each other as dependencies, and the whole system is not considered usable until all the updates are done.
They should generally be removed after the work is done.

---++++ el5-pegasus and el5-pegasus-build
These tags were made for Mats Rynge of the Pegasus project to build into.

---++++ el5-lcmaps-upgrade and el5-lcmaps-upgrade-build
These tags were made for Dave Dykstra to build into.

---++++ el[56]-condor-unified-development and el[56]-condor-unified-development-build
These tags were made for Carl Edquist's work on the unified !HTCondor RPM.

---+++ Collaborator Tags

---++++ hcc-*
For use by the Holland Computing Center at UNL.

---++++ uscms-*
For use by US CMS.


---++ Digicert cert switch

The following steps need to be taken for someone replacing their !DOEGrids cert with a !DigiCert cert:
   * admin should log in to the database and update the =users= table with their new CN
   * user should import their new cert into their browser and rerun =osg-koji setup= to fix their =client.crt=
   * if the user gets a python stack trace when connecting to koji-hub via their browser, they should clear their cookies

---++ Git builds

On EL5 only, we needed to run the following to allow Git builds from github:
=git config --system http.sslVerify false=
This is to avoid server cert verification failures against github.com

---++ CAs used for user authentication

Since our Koji instance uses certs for auth, we specify which CAs we trust for signing user certs.
The CA certs for user auth are concatenated together in the file /etc/pki/tls/certs/allowed-cas-for-users.crt.
A comment line before the "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" line is used to name the file the cert comes from.
We take the certs from the osg-ca-certs repository.

For example, when I added the CERN CAs to the bundle, I installed osg-ca-certs onto a Fermicloud VM, copied /etc/grid-security/certificates/CERN-TCA.pem (which signed user certs) and CERN-Root.pem (which signed CERN-TCA.pem) to koji-hub, catted them to the end of the allowed-cas-for-users.crt file, edited the file to add comments before the certs, and restarted httpd.
