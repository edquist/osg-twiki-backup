*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * Clemson - Investigating theory that the spool dir is pulled out from under the pilot
   * Harvard - LSF job submission works. Need to start accepting pilots.

   * !StashCache:
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.
