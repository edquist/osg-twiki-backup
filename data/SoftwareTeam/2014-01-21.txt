%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.30 / 3.2.4 | 2014-01-27 | 2014-02-03 | 2014-02-11 | |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Work Completed

   * Fixed Horst’s problem with Globus, HTCondor, RSV, and !OpenSSL 1.0.1; was due to a stale ROCKS build of HTCondor
   * Patched another Globus library to default to 1024-bit proxies instead of 512-bit ones ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1346][SW-1346]])
   * Finished builds, patches, and developer tests of Globus Toolkit 5.2.5 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1317][SW-1317]])
   * Finished the VOMS Admin 2.0.11 build, tests, and promotion to testing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1333][SW-1333]])
   * Updated to !XRootD 3.3.5 and pushed it to testing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1322][SW-1322]])
   * Finished work on a collection of OSG Display Data tickets (e.g., [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1326][SW-1326]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1351][SW-1351]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1352][SW-1352]])
   * Fixed a small issue introduced into the cctools package ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1323][SW-1323]])
   * Finished a BLAHP build, tests, and promotion to testing ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1350][SW-1350]])
   * Built, tested, fixed, built, tested, and promoted the latest VO client data package ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1344][SW-1344]])
   * Added VMU test jobs using osg-test from Subversion trunk
   * Rewrote VMU test email report and added recipients
   * Improved other aspects of VMU test reporting

---+++ Work In Progress

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. <span style="color: #F60;">Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.</span>

   * !OpenSSL 1.0.1: no open issues at this time; except, BLAHP fix for 1024-bit proxies will be promoted after the release (Mat)
   * Update Globus Toolkit: will promote to testing after the release (Mat)
   * Disaster recovery project for OSG infrastructure at UW–Madison: define project and implement stop-gap measures for Koji (!TimC, Mat)
   * HTCondor-CE and PBS: updates from !BrianB, what remains? (Suchandra)
   * Automated testing: Tweak reporting (!BrianL); add robust retries to yum installs (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * Support HCC and US-ATLAS in Koji: test HCC signing key (Mat, !BrianB)
   * UW ITB site: settle on an initial architecture, define tasks for Infrastructure (Mat, et al.)

---+++ Work Upcoming

   * osg-test 2.0 design and implementation (!TimC, !BrianL)
   * Documentation! (!TimC)
   * EL7 support (probably a ways off)

---+++ Notes

*JIRA Software tickets:* Tim C. has some concerns about the number of Open and In Progress tickets — they seem to go up and never (or rarely) down. He will have a PA tally some statistics and then decide what, if anything, should be done.

*HTCondor-CE:* Suchandra will test his configuration change this week. The change itself is a documentation issue, and !BrianB expanded that part of the documentation a bit already. Maybe an RSV probe can detect these kinds of configuration issues, but a more general run-a-job HTCondor-CE test would be even better. And Brian’s recent commits address some small issues that cropped up after dealing with similar issues at HCC.
