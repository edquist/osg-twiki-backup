*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

---++ OSG Release Team

Today is the testing freeze for 3.1.22.  Think of this one as soft serve ice cream.  At this point, I would like to know about all tickets that are intended to go into 3.1.22.  In JIRA terms, be sure they are labeled 3.1.22.  If possible, they should be marked ready for testing.  This is to ensure that we can plan for the testing.  Please have tickets marked by the end of the day.

When marking tickets "Ready for Testing", please also mark them "Unassigned".

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released [[InstallSoftwareWithOpenJDK7][Installing OSG Software to Use OpenJDK 7]]
   * CVMFS 2.1.12 tested (it is enough testing?)

---+++ Projects

   * Working on 3.1.22 (31 tickets targeted, 2 Ready for Release, 23 Ready for Testing, 6 In Progress)
   * Testing many tickets
   * Plan to release [[InstallOsgUpcomingSoftware][OSG Upcoming Software Repositories Installation Guide]]
   * Will add one more ticket for update VO data.

   * Document testing expertise on wiki as well as ITB site capabilities.
