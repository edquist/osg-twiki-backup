---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Completed (most) testing of OSG Software with !DigiCert SHA-2 certificates; found an old, incompatible !dCache/Fermi SRM client
   * Added HTCondor 7.9.6 to Upcoming repository
   * Completed (most) testing of HDFS 2 and associated packages
   * Posted high-level design for a unified HTCondor RPM
   * Fixed a set of related problems with =osg-ca-manage --location=
   * Fixed a bug in osg-test that could cause false failure reports under certain circumstances
   * Support!

---+++ OSG Projects

Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * HDFS 2 (Mat)
   * Update OASIS configuration (Dave Dykstra) — status from !BrianB?
   * Update OSG documentation to integrate OASIS (e.g., CE install) (Marco, Suchandra)
   * Update osg-configure to support OASIS (!BrianB, Suchandra) — not needed?
   * Simple HTCondor init script changes from Steve Timm (!BrianL)
   * Gratia? In osg-testing yet?

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl)
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL, essentially on hold)

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * BOSCO? (soon-ish, comes along with HTCondor 7.9)

---+++ Notes

*HDFS 2:* Trouble with !BeStMan integration, !XRootD. Upgrade tests are fine, though.

*OSG documentation:* Marco did survey of what documents [about what topic?] need to be changed; waiting on !BrianB for technical updates to the documentation.

*Condor init script changes:* Will not be ready in time for this release. !BrianL added the condor-drain function, but there are still two other features to be added.

*Gratia-Probe:* Suchandra is testing Tanya’s modifications to the Condor and PBS probes and hopes to have results today or tomorrow. !JohnW tested the Condor probes (the patch is at least 3 weeks old), and Suchandra also running them on his CE. PBS probes now have code to catch unrealistic efficiency reports. Also, there is a fix to quarantine records with unknown VOs.

*Condor RPM unification:* Carl worked on getting the UW RPM features (notably standard universe) into an OSG-style RPM, but did not have much success getting a koji or mock build working. He received feedback from Tim St. Clair, Todd Tannenbaum, and !BrainB; Todd wants more design documents. !TimC encouraged Carl to work on easier features than standard universe this week, so that we have something to show for our efforts.


---++ OSG Release Team

---+++ Accomplishments

   * JDK 7 out for testing

---+++ Projects

   * Release 3.1.19 (June 4th)
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: ITB and other external testing
   * frontier-squid bug fix
   * HTCondor 7.9.6 Ready for Test
   * SLURM: Scalability testing continues
   * !DigiCert SHA-2 testing
   * OASIS documentation

---+++ Notes

*Release 3.1.19:* Targeted for June 4. Will contain Upcoming packages as well.
   * Frontier-Squid bugfix to be in the release.
   * GIP integration with SLURM removed from Ready to Test
   * Waiting to hear from Derek about BLAHP.

*DigiCert/SHA2 tests:* Suchandra found some !BeStMan errors, which he will investigate, then put it on some production systems and test there. Neha found problems with the Fermi SRM clients. The developer has a new RPM which might fix the problem, but it is a significantly different version and requires (among other things) Java 7. Perhaps a minimal patch might be better than a full new RPM. In general, we need to identify the minimum OSG Software versions that are acceptable for SHA-2 use.

Considering including !GlideinWMS 2.7.1 in 3.1.19. !GlideinWMS 3 should probably go into Upcoming.
