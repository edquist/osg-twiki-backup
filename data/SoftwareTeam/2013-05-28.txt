---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released OSG Software 3.1.18

---+++ Projects

   * Release 3.1.19 (June 4th)
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: ITB and other external testing
   * frontier-squid bug fix
   * Test GIP integration with SLURM
   * SLURM: Scalability testing continues
   * !DigiCert SHA-2 testing
   * OASIS documentation

---+++ Notes

*Release 3.1.19:* Targeted for June 4. Will contain Upcoming packages as well.
   * Want to get started on JDK 7 testing as soon as possible.
   * Frontier-Squid bugfix to be in the release.
   * John Hover hasn't responded about testing GIP/SLURM integration yet.
   * Waiting to hear from Derek about BLAHP.

*DigiCert/SHA2 tests:* Suchandra found some !BeStMan errors, which he will investigate, then put it on some production systems and test there. Neha found problems with the Fermi SRM clients. The developer has a new RPM which might fix the problem, but it is a significantly different version and requires (among other things) Java 7. Perhaps a minimal patch might be better than a full new RPM. In general, we need to identify the minimum OSG Software versions that are acceptable for SHA-2 use.

Suchandra will talk to !TimT about ITB testing.

Considering including !GlideinWMS 2.7.1 in 3.1.19. !GlideinWMS 3 should probably go into Upcoming.

!BrianB, !TimC, and !TimC will talk about policy for where to put development series releases.
