---+ Building Globus

These are notes meant for the Software Team. 

In September 2011, we added Globus 5.2 to the VDT. Unfortunately, it is not a drop-in replacement for Globus 5.0 from EPEL. Due to changes in how threading was implemented, Globus shared libraries versions were incremented. (Globus maintained source code compatibility, so it's just a matter of rebuilding software that depends on Globus.) We hope that this will propagate neatly into EPEL, but until it does, we have done two things:

   1. Adding Globus 5.2 to our repository and rebuilt all software we ship that depends on Globus. 
   1. Copied packages from EPEL that we use that depend on Globus into our repository, and rebuilt them against Globus 5.2. 

A couple of notes from Matya Selmeci, who did this work are below. These are mostly copied from [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-200][JIRA SOFTWARE-200]].

---++ Note 1: Fulfilling build prereqs

The following packages had to be retagged into el5-gt52b to fulfill build prereqs:

   * glite-data-build
   * glite-data-transfer-interface
   * glite-service-discovery-api-c
   * glite-service-discovery-build-common-cpp
   * gridsite
   * lcmaps-plugins-basic
   * lcmaps-plugins-glexec-tracking
   * lcmaps-plugins-gums-client
   * lcmaps-plugins-saz-client
   * lcmaps-plugins-scas-client
   * lcmaps-plugins-verify-proxy
   * saml2-xacml2-c-lib

---++ Note 2: Rebuilding packages that depend on Globus

The following packages needed to be rebuilt: (arrows point from dependencies)

   * CGSI-gSOAP * <- voms
   * condor
   * dcache-srmclient
   * dcap-tunnel-gsi *
   * edg-gridftp-client
   * gfal <- CGSI-gSOAP, lfc-client (part of lcgdm), voms
   * glite-build-common-cpp
   * glite-data-delegation-api-c <- glite-security-delegation-interface, glite-data-build, CGSI-gSOAP
   * glite-data-delegation-cli <- glite-data-delegation-api-c, glite-data-util-c-devel
   * glite-data-util-c <- glite-service-discovery-api-c, glite-service-discovery-build-common-cpp, gridsite
   * glite-fts-client <- glite-build-common-cpp, glite-data-delegation-cli-devel, glite-data-transfer-interface
   * glite-security-delegation-interface
   * globus-gridmap-callout-error *
   * gratia-probe *
   * lcas
   * lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface <- lcmaps-plugins-*, globus-gridmap-callout-error, saml2-xacml2-c-lib
   * lcas-plugins-basic <- lcas
   * lcg-utils <- CGSI-gSOAP, gfal, voms
   * lcgdm <- voms, CGSI-gSOAP
   * lcmaps
   * myproxy <- voms
   * uberftp
   * voms *

---++ Notes for specific packages:

---+++ CGSI-gSOAP

needed to import this one so I could bump it

---+++ dcap-tunnel-gsi

needed to import this one so I could bump it

---+++ globus-gridmap-callout-error

Had to import this one from EPEL.
Got a 'flavor gcc64pthr has not been installed' error from configure. Fixed that in spec file.

Next error I got was this:

<pre class="screen">
 + /usr/share/globus/globus-gpt2pkg-config pkgdata/pkg_data_gcc64_dev.gpt
 /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.95712: line 47: /usr/share/globus/globus-gpt2pkg-config: No such file or directory
</pre>

that file is found only in epel's package of globus-core-5.17-3.el5, not in any of our packages (both old and new). I haven't found anything comparable in our globus-core, either.

Got a new globus-gridmap-callout-error srpm from Joe Bester by email. (globus-gridmap-callout-error-1.1-1.src.rpm)
Passed it through (no osg dir)

---+++ gratia-probe

this needed to be imported, and I don't really know where the original RPM comes from.

TODO add a README file

---+++ voms

globus_thread_h.patch

The error:
<pre class="screen">
    ../../src/include/gssapi_compat.h:76: error: conflicting declaration 'typedef int globus_mutex_t'
    /usr/include/globus/globus_thread.h:117: error: 'globus_mutex_t' has a previous declaration as 'typedef union globus_mutex_t globus_mutex_t'
</pre>
The typedef in gssapi_compat.h is surrounded by an ifdef, and the name of the macro being tested had changed in 5.2. Created a patch against the ifdef.

N.B.: there are two src/include/gssapi_compat.h files, one for the compat version (1.9.19.2) and one for the new version.

TODO patch should be sent upstream

---+++ java errors

The errors followed this general pattern:

<pre class="screen">
    Foo.java: cannot access Bar
    bad class file: Bar.class
    class file contains wrong class: (some completely unrelated class)
    Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpath.
</pre>
The problem was due to parallel make ( {{ make %{?_smp_mflags} }} ). Replaced all of those with make -j1 in the spec file.

Note when bumping voms that there are two macros, %release1 and %release2. One of these is used for the compat version, one for the current. Both have to be bumped.
