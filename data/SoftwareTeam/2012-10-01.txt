---+ OSG Software Team Meeting, 1 October 2012

*Attending:* Doug, Marco, Mat, Neha, Suchandra, Tim

---++ Introduction

No comments received yet on format of this meeting.

---++ Opening

*Triage Duty:* Mat this week, Tim next week. Currently, there are 6 open tickets.
Some of them are long term; one of them is a jdk security vulnerability for which we are waiting for a fix from Oracle.

*OSG 3.x Sites:* 45 (-2) from last week.
Marco explains that report is only showing currently active sites--so these are dependent on RSV reports; fluctuations should be expected. 

---++ Accomplishments

   * Shipped 3.1.9. Had to pull Condor 7.8.4 the next day, then unpull Condor 7.8.4 the day after that.
   * Also released OSG 1.2.30 with JDK update.
   * Doug worked on testing with sha-2 certs.
   * Mat, Tim, with help from Brian worked on an lcmaps packaging issue with plugin modules.\
Patched mash (the software with which we create our repos), sent patch to the GOC.\
We want them to install it when our next release comes. (Scheduled for next Tue, Oct 9).
   * osg-pki-tools packaged.\
This has to do with the upcoming !DigiCert cert changes.\
These scripts are for admins for getting !DigiCert certs? (TODO MORE EXPLANATION NEEDED).\
Von and other security folks are doing training using these new tools.

---++ Issues

   * No big blockers for OSG 3 deployments at VOs.
   * SHA-2 is still our big issue.
   * Not much to report this week. People are working on !JGlobus, GUMS, !Xrootd, !GSI.
   * GUMS 1.3.18 has lots of issues--need to have a phone call to discuss it.
   * Texas Tech (Alan Sill) still having issues getting to OSG 3.\
We solved VOMS issues and GSI-OpenSSH issues for them and updated documentation.\
This is an ITB site, so it's small but visible and important.\
Suchandra currently helping them debug.\
We should be proactive in fixing problems in our documentation, packaging, etc. Make a ticket, let them see the ticket, etc.
   * Upcoming release: 3.1.10. This is a small release on Tue, Oct. 9. Contains new CA certs from IGTF at a minimum.\
Anything else that is rock solid by the freeze on Friday at noon can also go in.\
Other potential software to include: osg-pki-tools, condor-7.8.5, mash.

---++ Actions

   * Lots of SHA-2 testing. (Doug, Neha?)
   * Discussion about GUMS 1.3.18. (Neha, Suchandra)
   * Investigation of Texas Tech issues.
   * Investigation of new Bestman 2 release.\
Doug suggests that while we may not want to update Bestman 2 right away, we need to make sure that changes Alex Sim made (via patches) are not lost.
   * RSV updates. (Mat)
   * osg-cleanup fixes (to deal with Globus changes). (Mat)
   * SL 5 test failures need investigation. (Mat)
