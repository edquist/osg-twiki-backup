---+ OSG Software Component: !BeStMan 2

---++ Purpose

!BeStMan 2 provides an SRM interface so that you can access storage elements (SE's) with SRM commands.
It takes a SURL such as srm://host:8443/srm/v2/server?SFN=/pathname and returns a TURL such as 
gsiftp://host:2811/pathname.

It can also handle space tokens, space reservation (in full mode), checksums, and other features.

---++ Usage

Typical usage is by installing bestman2-server, configuring it to talk to underlying !GridFTP resoures.  These !GridFTP resources then retrieve the requested file from the underlying storage system.

It is used by all SRM endpoints with the exception of dcache sites.

---++ Source

LBL codeforge: https://codeforge.lbl.gov/scm/?group_id=54

Code used to be maintained by LBNL, but it is now maintained by OSG.  Code changes should still be coordinated with LBL team.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History
