---+ Possible Upcoming Work

These are ideas for possible upcoming work. The work is not scheduled yet and there may not be tickets for the work yet. It's a place to collect ideas that may turn into projects.

   * A "snow leopard" release in mid to late January that would fix urgent problems or add small but important features. These might include:
      * osg-configure improvements, including:
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-417][SOFTWARE-417]]: Set permissions for GIP directories
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-367][SOFTWARE-367]]: Configure Globus firewall information
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-315][SOFTWARE-315]]: Edit authorization configuration
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-427][SOFTWARE-427]]: Improve error messages
      * RSV improvements, including
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-253][SOFTWARE-253]]: Allow parameters to probes (needed for storage probes)
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-250][SOFTWARE-250]]: Update info-services probe to work with RPM-based RSV. 
         * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-414][SOFTWARE-414]]: Improve rsv-control output when used by osg-configure
      * Improve documentation (details forthcoming)
      * Improve osg-system-profiler
      * Update to Globus 5.2.0 (We currently have a pre-release of 5.2.0)
      * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-363][SOFTWARE-363]]: Port the Globus cleanup scripts from Pacman-based VDT
      * Upgrade to Condor 7.6.5
   * Support for SHA-2
   * Add support for Scientific Linux 6
   * Add support for CREAM
   * Adding missing packages that were in Pacman-based VDT:
      * [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-439][GUMS]]
      * Gratia Server
      * Squid (appropriate for use with Frontier). It's not clear if there is demand for this. Please holler if you'd like it.
   * Validate and release new release of Bestman2
   * Improve internal test infrastructure
      * Begin testing against pre-releases of OSG
      * Expand set of tests
      * Incrementally improve test infrastructure to meet our needs
   * Upgrade software that's behind the curve:
      * New lcg-utils (involves deeper changes due to changes in dependencies that are used)
   * Update to new lcmaps (much better logging)
   * Update to the new glexec
   * Eliminate use of LCAS in lcas-lcmaps-gt4-interface [[http://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-284][SOFTWARE-284]]
   * Validate and release new Gratia Condor probe
   * Mirror EPEL repositories? 
   * Investigate: can we eliminate the need for shared home directories on the CE?
   * Improve integration testbed:
      * Get glideinWMS factory running for ITB
      * Get !HammerCloud running at UC_ITB
   * Improve usability of OSG Software? (Requires some understanding/investigation/surveys, etc. of where the problems are)
   * Formulate process (manual or automated) of discovering software that might need to be updated
   * Add Pigeon tools
   * Improve handling of Java dependencies (osg-software-tools, Bestman, etc), perhaps via better handling of Maven in Koji.
   * Code review of the build infrastructure (especially =osg-build=)
