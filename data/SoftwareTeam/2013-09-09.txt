*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Notes


---++ OSG Release Team

Today is the package freeze for 3.1.23.  By the end of today, we have the definitive list of packages for release.

Normally, we would expect the majority of the tickets to be marked "Ready for Release" by now.  So, major testing effort is needed during this week. Let's have everything marked "Ready for Release" by end of the day on Thursday. So, Brian can thoroughly test the tarballs on Friday. 

---+++ Accomplishments

Testing on HTCondor CE started.  Hope to complete soon.
