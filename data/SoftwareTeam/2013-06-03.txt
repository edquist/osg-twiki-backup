   * Update osg-configure to support OASIS (!BrianB, Suchandra): not needed?
   * Simple HTCondor init script changes from Steve Timm (!BrianL): extra week FTW?
   * Gratia probes (Suchandra): internal testing, then promote

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * HTCondor-CE: documentation review (!BrianL)
   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): integration of Fedora spec file, list of remaining diffs, parallel universe support

   * Release 3.1.19 (June 4th)
   * Migrate from Oracle JDK 6 to !OpenJDK 7: ITB and other external testing
   * frontier-squid bug fix
   * HTCondor 7.9.6 Ready for Test
   * SLURM: Scalability testing continues
   * !DigiCert SHA-2 testing
   * OASIS documentation

---+++ Notes

*Java 7 packages:* Announced and into the testing repos. Oklahoma was interested, but Horst might be unable to test due to travel. Suchandra and Xin also doing some testing. Suchandra covering GUMS and HDFS.

*GIP integration with SLURM:* Will not make it into 3.1.19.

*GlideInWMS 2.7.1:* Suchandra to talk to Jeff Dost at UCSD -- they will need to upgrade their factory in order to test the VO frontend (since the VO frontend is not backwards compatible). 50/50 chance of that happening before Friday.

*Fermi SRM Client:* Neha updated tarball -- someone from the Software Team needs to update patches and create a new RPM from it.
