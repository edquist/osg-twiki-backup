---+!! Orace JDK 6 Deprecation (WIP)

%TOC%

[[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-890][Main Oracle JDK 6 Deprecation Ticket (SOFTWARE-890)]]

---++ Background

Currently, several of our packages are Java-based, and we build them against
the Oracle JDK 6. Oracle is officially discontinuing public support for Java 6
in February 2013, including security fixes. This is a problem for us due to the
numerous security flaws in Java that people keep discovering. Therefore we must
move away from Oracle JDK 6.

---++ Possible Replacements
[[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-892][Oracle JDK 6 Replacements Ticket (SOFTWARE-892)]]

Current options on the table are:
   * Oracle JDK 7
   * !OpenJDK 6
   * !OpenJDK 7

---++ Java Software in Use (TODO)

Most of this software will need to be certified to work on whichever Oracle JDK 6
replacement we plan to switch to. However, see the notes below.

---+++ Lists

(As we narrow down the items we require, these lists should be turned into a
table or a spreadsheet with information on the status of the packages)

---++++ Packages depending directly on Oracle JDK

   * bestman2
   * emi-trustmanager-tomcat
   * gridftp-hdfs
   * gums
   * hadoop-0.20
   * jclassads
   * voms-admin-server
   * osg-ce
   * osg-client
   * osg-gridftp-xrootd
   * osg-se-bestman
   * osg-se-bestman-xrootd
   * osg-se-hadoop
   * osg-wn-client
   
---++++ Packages depending indirectly on Oracle JDK

   * glite-ce-common-java
   * glite-ce-monitor
   * glite-jdl-api-java
   * glite-ce-cream (we don't ship it yet)
   * glite-ce-cream-api-java (we don't ship it yet)
   * glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin
   * gratia (via glite-trustmanager-tomcat)
   * rsv-metrics (via bestman2-client)
   * xrootd-hdfs
    
---++++ OSG Software depending on Java
   * dcache-srmclient
   * gratia 
   * hadoop (ie Hadoop 2.0.0)
   * pegasus

---++++ Dependencies of OSG Software depending on Java
   * argus-* (argus-pep-api-java, cemon build only)
   * cog-jglobus*
   * cryptix
   * emi-trustmanager*
   * jetty
   * jglobus
   * maven*
   * puretls
   * slf4j
   * voms-api-java
   * xalan-j2
   * xerces
   * zookeeper (hadoop builds)

---+++ Notes:

Since we are planning to deprecate =glite-ce-monitor= (aka !CEMon) in favor of
=osg-info-services=, we may be able to get rid of it and its dependencies,
namely:
   * argus-*
   * glite-ce-monitor
   * glite-ce-osg-ce-plugin
   * jclassads

Since we are planning to deprecate =jglobus-1= in favor of =jglobus-2=, we may
be able to get rid of its dependencies, namely:
   * cog-jglobus
   * cryptix
   * puretls


---++ Groups to Contact (TODO)

Since we do not even remotely have the resources to re-certify all the software
we ship, we should ask the upstream developers for help and information
whenever we can.

(TODO: This list should probably also be a table, and should contain (a) group name; (b); contact info; (c) packages they support; (d) status)

   * gratia team (gratia)
   * EGI (glite-*?)
   * dCache team (dcache-srmclient, others?)
   * ...
