---+ Software/Release Team ITB Site Design

---++ Proposed Structure

*(TODO)*
Copy machine info from google docs spreadsheet about machines in 3370A

---++ Site Elements

   * GUMS (run on its own host)
   * Run both HTCondor-CE and GRAM (can do both on the same CE)
   * Run HTCondor as the back-end (for now, may consider adding PBS in the future)
   * Run osg-info-services instead of CEMon
   * Run RSV on a separate box (maybe one of the worker nodes)
   * Fix [[Documentation.Release3.SitePlanning]] page to remove reference to WS-GRAM
   * Squid -- which machine to set it up on
   * Pass on syslog-ng?
   * NFS / other shared file system (for OSG_APP and OSG_DATA)

---++ Questions
   * What VO are we going to belong to? (Ask other ITB sites)
   * How to do OIM registration

---++ University of Chicago ITB Instance

---+++ Compute Elements
   * itbv-ce-pbs - gatekeeper talking to PBS
   * itbv-ce-condor - gatekeeper talking to Condor
   * vtbv-ce-condor - SL6 gatekeeper talking to Condor
   * itbv-ce-htcondor - soon-to-be functional HTCondor CE

---+++ Batch Systems
   * Condor running on all worker nodes
   * PBS running on all worker nodes

---+++ Worker Nodes
   * 4 worker nodes (1 on SL6, 3 on SL5) with glexec installed

---+++ Storage
   * xrootd/bestman SE with 3 data nodes
   * hdfs/bestman SE with 3 data nodes
   * dcache SE with 3 data nodes

---+++ Other
   * 4 submit nodes / interactive machines / build nodes (2 on SL6 / 2 on SL5)
   * GUMS host running on SL5
   * Central RSV monitor system
   * !glideinWMS front-end talking to integration glide in factory


---++ 2013 Nov 8 meeting
   * Should put HTCondor-CE CE and GRAM CE on separate machines, but can have multiple job managers on each one
   * We should run something other than PBS when we want to try a separate batch system (because Suchandra is already running a PBS gatekeeper)
   * SLURM may be a good choice because we have local expertise on campus -- but may not be useful for managing "small" nodes
   * SGE is a possibility but we have few sites running it and those are not expected to increase
   * Will probably have more than 4 worker nodes -- mostly 2-slot machines
   * (Mat) Need to learn more on storage. We _should_ run Bestman since we have the most experience with this, but do we also want to run hdfs and/or xrootd ?
   * 3 storage nodes / 4 worker nodes ?
   * Can you put !GlideinWMS frontend on a CE? (Ask Suchandra)

   * Put everything in the "OSG" VO so we won't have to run a VOMS server
   * Shared filesystem (NFS?). Do not run fileserver on SE or CE
   * Ask Suchandra: are his data nodes both xrootd and HDFS nodes?
   * Docs recommend putting Squid on the CE. (If we have two CEs, do we need two squids?)


---+++ Compute Elements
   * HTCondor-CE
   * GRAM CE

---+++ Batch Systems
   * Condor on all worker nodes
   * other job manager on all worker nodes

---+++ Worker Nodes
   * 4 of them, at least one SL5

---+++ Storage
   * bestman SE with 3 data nodes, at least one SL5

---+++ Squid
   * maybe on one of the storage nodes?

---+++ RSV
   * can put on a worker node (these days people are not putting it on the CE)

---+++ GUMS host
   * should not be on a worker node or data node
