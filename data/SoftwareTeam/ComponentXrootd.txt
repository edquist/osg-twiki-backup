---+ OSG Software Component: !XRootD
---++ Purpose

!XRootD is a hierarchical file-based storage system.  It has datanodes that store files, then redirectors that handle requests.  A request for a file will ask all datanodes to see if they have the file.  The first one to respond will serve the file.  More complicated setups are possible, such as a redirector will first query local nodes, then query up to a regional/global redirector which will in turn ask other site redirectors if they have the file (similar to walking up and down a binary tree).

---++ Usage

CMS and ATLAS both have preliminary xrootd networks.  For instance, CMS software uses a fallback method to query xrootd in case of missing files (job would fail anyway, so might as well try xrootd before crashing out).

---++ Source

xrootd is developed by a collaboration include SLAC and cern.  www.xrootd.org
