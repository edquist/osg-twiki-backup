---+ Meeting between Executive Team and OSG Software Coordinator, 2-Feb-2012

---++ Some recent events
   * The initial RPM transition has been completed. [[Documentation.Release3.ReleaseNotes][Release Notes]]<br>We have shipped the CE, SE (Bestman/Xrootd/HDFS), RSV, Client, Worker Node Client, VOMS, and glexec.
   * Alex Sim and his team are no longer supporting Bestman 2 for OSG as of December, 2011. 
      * The lastest version released by Alex was tested by us and is now in production
      * Neha Sharma is the primary support in OSG and Doug Strain is the backup. 
      * We have settled on the process by which we'll maintain the Bestman source code while still collaborating with the SRM team at LBNL. (They will host the source code and provide limited guidance on proposed changes.) 
      * We have made updates to Bestman since it was released. 

---++ Deployment of OSG Software 3
We know that the new RPM-based OSG Software 3 has been deployed at:

   * SMU_HPC
   * !GridUNESP_CENTRAL
   * RENCI-Blueberry
   * CMS Tier2 at Wisconsin (worker nodes, HDFS, Xrootd, SRM & !GridFTP, but not yet the CE)
   * Nebraska: Firefly, Red & Prairiefire (7 Compute Elements total)

Representatives from CMS and ATLAS have told me that they have asked their sites to update by April 2012. So far we have not had much feedback from individual sites other than SMU and RENCI, but I expect it will increase in the next two months.
