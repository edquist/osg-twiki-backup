---++ Accomplishments

   * Prepared updates for release this week: CA certificates (IGTF 1.50), graphtool, javascriptrrd, osg-build, and mash.
   * Determined that GUMS 1.3.18 works with SHA-2 certificates!
   * Had a very useful conference call about the state and future of GUMS.
   * Packaged osg-pki-tools again; it is being tested further this week during Digicert training.
   * Patched LSF jobmanager with xcount option to support HTPC — waiting for test results from Horst et al.

   * Upgraded to !XRootD 3.2.5 (in osg-testing).

---++ Issues

   * SHA-2 testing: Winding down, still investigating !XRootD and !BeStMan/jGlobus.
