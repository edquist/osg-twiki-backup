---++ Meeting Notes

---+++ 12 February 2015

1:00–2:00 p.m. CT%BR%*Attending:* Bo, Chander, FKW, Jeff, Tim, !RobG, Ilija, Lincoln, Anna, Tanya, Robert

   * FKW gave high-level charge.
   * Reviewed high-level deliverables in [[SW023_XrootdAcrossOsg][the project plan]]
   * Chander: is there a set of constraints on the project?
      * Can we say that “no compute is required to do anything to participate”?
      * Users do not see Xrootd protocol details - only our defined interfaces (cp, file transfer, posix).
      * “Do we make VOs register their source endpoints?"
         * Yes - we have this be “invite only” right now (OSG VO [XD allocation, Connect], Simons Foundation, and IF).  Not open to other VOs until the system is delivered.
         * Only thing required is Xrootd API; we can open up in the future.
      * Suggestion from Chander: Look at the notes from the !iRODS project.
      * How many origin servers can a site have?
   * !TimC: How does this look to the user?
      * All software and environment variables are setup by the pilot; possibly pulling software from OASIS.
      * Pilot will need to figure out the location of the nearest cache (or skip it altogether if it’s running at the source site!).
   * Anna:  Updates since Xrootd workshop:
      * Improve monitoring information from stashcp itself.
      * Waiting on software update from Xrootd.
      * 7 caches: UC (one testing, one production), IU, BU, UNL, UCSD, Illinois
      * All underneath https://github.com/OSGConnect/StashCache
   * Note to self: Need to make diagrams!
   * Milestones:
      * Beta version: AHM.  All components (RPMs) in place at some level.
      * Version 1: HTCondor Week.
      * After that, move out to “regularly scheduled areas”.
   * Review of responsibilities: see updated twiki pages.
   * Try to squeeze this to a 30 minute meeting (1:30–2:00?)
