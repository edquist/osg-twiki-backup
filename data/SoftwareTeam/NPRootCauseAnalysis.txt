---+ Native Packaging Root Cause Analysis

This document attempts to answer a question posed by Miron:

<blockquote>
Why have our native packaging efforts taken so long? Where did we go wrong, and what did we do right?
</blockquote>

Dan Fraser and Alain Roy worked on this question. As input, Alain and Tim Cartwright put together a lot of the [[NativePackagingHistory][history of our native packaging efforts]].

---++ Major Findings
   * We did not have clear requirements (evidence: chasing changes)
   * We had a limited understanding of community expectations for how native packages are used. (And this means there are unstated requirements stemming from these community expectations.)
   * We did not have a requirements repository for tracking changes to requirements. 
   * We did not have a clear plan against which we can track the work done to meet requirements. 
   * We had a limited understanding of just how different RPM and Pacman packaging are (this is a major restructuring), and limited external guidance to help us through the process. We needed more input from stakeholders. 

---++ Minor findings
   * We didn't appreciate how significant community work on native packaging was (Mattias Ellert, EPEL…)

---++ What will we do differently in the future?

Primary Change: We will get requirements and putting them into a repository that can be tracked.
