---+ OSG Software Component: GUMS

---++ Purpose

GUMS is a service that authorizes and maps users from their global identity to a local (Unix id) identity. It is not a required service (some sites use the simple =edg-mkgridmap= to construct a =grid-mapfile= instead), but it is commonly used. It is helpful when you have more than one resource (Compute Element, Storage Element, etc.), because they can share authorization and mapping data. It is particularly helpful when using !gLExec at a site, because !gLExec runs on every worker node and needs authorization and mapping information.

GUMS is a web application that runs in Tomcat.
