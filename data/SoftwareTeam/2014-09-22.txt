*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * HTCondor-CE: See joint update in the Software section of this report
   * !GlideIn Scale Tests:
      * First level (Idle Scaling is done),
      * Second level (maxing running jobs at schedd) in progress). More details [[http://www.t2.ucsd.edu/twiki2/bin/view/Main/GlideinScaleTests2014][GlideInScaleTests]].
         * 10k parallel running jobs passed no problems
         * 20k parallel running jobs passed with no problems
         * At 30k we start to see a decrease in the job submission success rate. Although node resources were still available. Still investigating with HTCondor team ticket htcondor-support #8479.
   * OASIS 2.0.0 ITB version made progress but not done. Finished the “all in one node” install; still working on splitting across two nodes (like production install).
   * Network data store reinstalled at GOC. Waiting for RSV probe to be installed / tested at GOC.
