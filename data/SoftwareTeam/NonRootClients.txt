---+ Project 20: Install Clients Anywhere by Anyone (aka Non-Root Clients)

---++ Description

---+++ Background

Users often need to install client tools in a way that does not work well with RPMs, either because the install must be performed without =root= access or because the entire install must be contained within a single, separate directory hierarchy. These needs correspond to two very common use cases:

   * An end user (or their system administrator) installs the client tools, to allow job submission into the OSG, but does not have root access to the submit machine.
   * A site administrator installs the worker node client tools on a shared filesystem, which is then mounted on all worker nodes.

The project is often called the “non-root client” project, but that is a misnomer, because it covers both the non-root user and single-directory use cases.

---+++ Goal and Scope

The main goal of this project is to provide packages of client tools that can be installed anywhere by anyone. Specifically, each package should install into any single directory on a filesystem and the install process should work for any user with appropriate permissions.

The project is limited to the contents of two existing RPM metapackages: =osg-wn-client= (the worker node client) and =osg-client= (the full client, a strict superset of the worker node client).

---+++ Risks

The main risk for this project is the schedule and its effect on the End-Of-Life (EOL) date for OSG 1.2.

While most sites (> 60%) have moved to OSG 3.1 on their Compute Element, there are still many sites that have not upgraded their worker nodes, because they use a shared filesystem to distribute the worker node client tools.
