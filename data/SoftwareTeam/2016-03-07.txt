*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

!GitHub plans converging. No major open issues that are holding things up.

!BeStMan, VOMS API Java, etc. At the point of setting up a reproducible environment in !FermiCloud for testing. Next step is to tune the log4j properties to get good logging. Also, there was discussion about moving to VOMS API Java v3 — !BrianB thinks that this would be fairly easy for !BeStMan and GUMS, but well nigh impossible (or at least impractical) for VOMS Admin itself. We will continue to investigate both threads.

---+++ Support Update
   * Clemson (!BrianL) - Mem requests not being forwarded to batch system. Troubleshooting session with admin today, suspected bug in the BLAHP.
   * Colorado (Marian) - Awaiting reponse about transfering SGE parameters into BLAHP ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-2199][SOFTWARE-2199]]). Issues with BLAHP and lcg-cp SAM tests
   * FIU (!BrianL) - Assisting admins set up new CE for CMS Tier3
   * Harvard (Marian/!BrianL) - Troubleshooting BLAHP SLURM submission
   * MIT (!BrianL) - Neha assisting with GUMS issues
   * OU (!BrianL) - Setting up new CentOS7 CE in front of their SLURM cluster
   * Purdue (!BrianL) - Help Erik Gough investigate lengthy pool fill times

   * !StashCache:
      * Working to get "all green" in monitoring - i.e., using the probes we already developed.
      * Submitting jobs using !StashCache through !NoVA production system.
   * CE-View (part of HTCondor-CE): got OK from AGIS team, now need to confirm with Scott that the update was successful.
