*Attending:* Mat, Tim, Doug, Neha, Suchandra, Marco, Xin, Brian

---++ Announcements

*Triage Duty:* Doug this week, Suchandra next week; %RED%14 open tickets%ENDCOLOR%.

*OSG Deployments:* OSG 3.x: 56 (0) last week; 12 (+11) using 3.1.11; OSG 1.2: 45 (–3) sites, 0 using 1.2.31.

---++ Accomplishments

---++ Issues

%RED%Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are resolved/closed when done.%ENDCOLOR%

   * !BeStMan/jGlobus: test failures, broader testing, release timing, etc.
   * !XRootD GSI fix and 3.3 update (which affects plug-ins). At this point we do not know if we want to ship 3.3 or 3.2.6 with the December release.
   * Pakiti: currently being tested by security team.
   * SLURM
   * GUMS, list of issues
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * Help debug Texas Tech (Alan Sill et al.), Caltech (Steven Lo), and  Oklahoma (Horst). These sites should be pinged about their status. #SOFTWARE-851, #SOFTWARE-852, #SOFTWARE-853 created as 'umbrella' tickets to keep track of these.
   * !GlideinWMS: Needs more testing. Unfortunately we have few testing sites, since many do not use our RPMs to install.
   * OSG-Configure changes
   * voms-api-java: Should be ready in a week or two.

---+++ Coming Soon(ish)

   * HTCondor name change (pending, eventually)
   * CVMFS (for OASIS) (December)
   * HTCondor-CE (February)

---++ Notes

Brian thinks we may be able to get a demo license for LSF which should allow us to do testing without waiting for others as much.
Brian thinks the base hadoop 2.0.0 is ready to be deployed, but in unsure about aux. components such as gridftp and xrootd. He will test it on a tier 2 in a week or two. Brian proposes a drop-dead date of next Monday to decide which version of xrootd goes into the next release.

We should have a page or set of pages on the twiki containing checklists for manual testing of packages (for those that we do not have sufficient automated tests for).
These lists should be used to determine when a certain component can be declared "ready for production."
Does not need to be very detailed (i.e. no step-by-step instructions needed), but should be concrete--something we can do and know when it is done.
In addition to adding our own tests to the lists, we should ask collaborators to give us summaries of what they test, and add those to the list as well.
