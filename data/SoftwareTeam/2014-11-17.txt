*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Code Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

---+++ Scaling Tests
---++++ HTCondor Pool Tests
   * We are trying to make SHARED_PORT work at the glidein level. We discovered a bug, so it does not work out of the box since all glideins end up listening on the same port (9618) and choke each other. 
---++++ HTCondor CE Tests
   * New limit reached at 10.5k when using longer running jobs (~6 hours). The knob is at the !JobRouter. And we are waiting for UNL to see if we can further increase it.
