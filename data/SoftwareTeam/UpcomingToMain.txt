---+ Promoting Packages from Upcoming to Main

Sometimes we move packages from Upcoming to the Main repositories in the
middle of a release series. Once the Release Manager has given tentative
approval for such a move:

If needed, move the software from upcoming to trunk and release using
the usual process:

   1. Merge changes to the package in SVN from branches/upcoming to trunk.
   %BR%
   2. Build the package from trunk.
   %BR%
   3. Follow the normal process to prepare a build for release (including
      development testing, promotion, etc.).

On release day, when the package has been released in the Main
production repository, clean up the package from the upcoming repos:

   1. <p>Untag from *all upcoming repos* the version of the package
   corresponding to the version that was released in main.
   %RED%(Do NOT untag from the osg-upcoming-elN-release-X.Y.Z tags).%ENDCOLOR%
   </p>
   <p>Also, untag all equal or lesser NVRs (minus the dist tag) from all
   upcoming repos.
   </p>
   <p>If you do not have the privileges to untag from upcoming-release,
   someone on the Release Team can help.
   </p>
   <p>(These steps are necessary to make sure Koji builds can't mistakenly
   use an older build from the upcoming repos).
   </p>
   2. Unless there's a newer build in branches/upcoming than what was
   released, remove the package directory from branches/upcoming.
