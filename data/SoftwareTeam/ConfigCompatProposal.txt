---+ Proposal — Project 3 — Configuration Compatibility RPM

---++ Requirements

---+++ Concise Statement

Produce an RPM that contains a version of the VDT configuration infrastructure that is compatible with both Pacman installs and RPM installs.

---+++ Deadline

No specific deadline has been requested.

---+++ Stakeholders

???

---++ Proposed Scope of Work

Convert all Perl modules and scripts in the Pacman VDT-Core and VDT-Configure-Base packages, then package as a single vdt-compat RPM.  Incorporate other, existing functionality in vdt-compat.

---++ Proposed WBS

*Note:* For our estimates of effort, we are using “FTE weeks” according to Chander’s definition: “1 FTE week (at CS UW-Madison) is the amount of work that can be reasonably completed by 1 person in one week working on one task (at CS UW-Madison). This implicitly covers all the overheads and interrupts that occur in this environment.” Thus, actual calendar time may be greater, if other projects or delays intervene.
