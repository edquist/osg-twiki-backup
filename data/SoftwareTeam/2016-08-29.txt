*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

There seem to be problems with the Globus Toolkit updates:
   * !GridFTP - writing data in ordered mode seems to be broken
   * !MyProxy / GSI - basic !MyProxy operations break with latest GSI, but not current OSG one

The CVMFS 2.3.0 update has a lot of issues — is it really ready for *production*? Or would it be best to keep it in Upcoming another month? Sites that need it can easily get it from there.
   * Decision: Wait a month.

September tickets due today:

|  6 | Brian Lin - mostly HTCondor-CE |
