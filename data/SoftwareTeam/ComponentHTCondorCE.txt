---+ OSG Software Component: HTCondor CE featuring blahp

---++ Purpose

HTCondor CE is a gatekeeper, like Globus' gatekeeper, that acts as a site's entrace to their computational cluster. Users can submit grid jobs to an HTCondor CE and it transforms them via the HTCondor job router into jobs that can be submitted to HTCondor, PBS/SLURM, LSF and SGE backends that a site may utilize.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

Source: [[https://github.com/bbockelm/condor-ce]]

HTCondor CE uses the blahp heavily to submit jobs to non-HTCondor backends and its upstream can be found at https://github.com/prelz/BLAH. The HTCondor team should be made aware of any changes to the blahp since they package it in their externals. Derek Weitzel manages the OSG version of the blahp (https://github.com/osg-bosco/BLAH), which is a fork of an updated version of the Italian grid's with HTCondor's patches applied and some additional python scripts that HTCondor CE uses.

---++ Packaging

Since the OSG owns HTCondor CE, the spec file is updated often in the source (config/htcondor-ce.spec). The tarball can be generated with:

<pre class='screen>
%UCL_PROMPT% git archive --prefix=%{name}-%{version}/ v%{version} | gzip > %{name}-%{version}.tar.gz
</pre>
