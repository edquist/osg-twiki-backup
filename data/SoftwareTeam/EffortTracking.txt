---+ Effort Tracking

This page describes a simple plan for tracking effort in the OSG Software and Release teams.

<p style="color: #F60;">As of 13 February 2014, this document is a draft. The goal is to pilot, refine, and settle on the details prior to 1 March.</p>

---++ Basic Ideas

At its simplest, we would like to understand how much effort is spent on various types of work over time. The focus is on having reasonably accurate, unbiased data. We might use the data later, for example, to hone future OSG proposals. And of course, all federal funding is subject to effort tracking, so it should not be anything new for anyone.

There are just a few simple ideas to keep in mind:

   * *Each week, report your effort on OSG Software and Release activities* \
     <p>Just include a section in your weekly status report with this information (see sample below).</p>
   * Follow standard federal regulations for calculating effort (e.g., OMB Circular A-21)\
     <p>The main point here is that all of your job-related activity for a week counts as 100%, whether that is exactly 40 hours of work, a little less (subject to your local institution’s rules), or more. This implies that, say, 4 hours of effort could result in different percentages of effort from week to week; for a 40-hour week 4 hours is 10%, but for a 50-hour week (which I hope is exceedingly rare!) 4 hours is 8%.</p>
     <p>Report 100% of your effort each week, but note that all effort outside of the Technology area falls into a single category. Unless you work at UW–Madison, we do not need to know any details about your effort outside of the Technology area.</p>
     <p>If you are assigned to the Technology area for less than 100%, please report your actual effort for Technology accurately. Workloads vary from week to week, even if you are assigned to Technology for, say, 50%, but you actually work 24 hours in a 40-hour week, you should report 60% effort for that week.</p>
   * Effort is reported as *integer* percentages, no less accurate than 5% intervals\
     <p>So please do not report percentages like 43.21% and please do not round to the nearest 10%.</p>
