---+ OSG Software Component: !GlideTester


---++ Purpose

This package can be thought as a "specialized" [[ComponentGlideinWMSVOFrontend][Glidein Frontend]]. It is used to perform scalability measurements of web faced services at exact concurrency points (parallel running clients).
 

---++ Usage

Typical usage is to install the glideTester and HTCondor Schedd on same node and "connect" it to an HTCondor Collector/Negotiator. And connect it to a glideIn Factory. Although not required it makes a best use of resources when is used on a sleeper pool.

Detailed instructions on how to install it can be found here:
