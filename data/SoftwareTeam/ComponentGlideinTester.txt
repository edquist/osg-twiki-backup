---+ OSG Software Component: ! Glidetester


---++ Purpose

This package can be thought as a "specialized" [[ComponentGlideinWMSVOFrontend][Glidein Frontend]]. It is used to perform scalability measurements of web faced services at exact concurrency points (parallel running clients).
 

---++ Usage

Typical usage is to install the glideTester and HTCondor Schedd on same node and "connect" it to an HTCondor Collector/Negotiator. And connect it to a glideIn Factory. Although not required it makes a best use of resources when the test is run over a sleeper pool.


---++ Source

The source code can be found in sourceforge:

svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/osgscal/code/load_generators/glideTester/trunk glideTester

---++ Packaging

Not yet packaged always installed from the tarball or directly from the svn trunk.
