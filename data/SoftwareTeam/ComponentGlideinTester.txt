---+ OSG Software Component: !GlideTester


---++ Purpose

This package can be thought as a "specialized" [[ComponentGlideinWMSVOFrontend][Glidein Frontend]]. It is used to perform scalability measurements of web faced services at exact concurrency points (parallel running clients).
 

---++ Usage

Typical usage is to install the glideTester and HTCondor Schedd on same node and "connect" it to an HTCondor Collector/Negotiator. And connect it to a glideIn Factory. Although not required it makes a best use of resources when is used on a sleeper pool.

Detailed instructions on how to install it can be found here:

[[http://sourceforge.net/p/osgscal/code/HEAD/tree/load_generators/glideTester/trunk/doc/README][GlideTester README]]


---++ Source

The source code can be found in sourceforge:

<pre class="screen">svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/osgscal/code/load_generators/glideTester/trunk glideTester</pre>

And it is currently owned and maintained by Edgar Fajardo in the trunk of sourceforge svn repo.


---++ Packaging

Not yet packaged &ndash; always installed from the tarball or directly from the svn trunk.

---++ History

GlideTester was originally written by Igor Sfiligoi in 2009. It was designed based on the code of the GlideinWMS tester in order to test the scalability of a storage element.

During Summer/Spring 2014 was used on the efforts to test the scalability of the AAA system by Carl Volsualo and Edgar Fajardo.
