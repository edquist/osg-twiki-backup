*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.

Work with !TimC to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are correct state. %RED%Be sure to mark active work as _In Progress_.%ENDCOLOR%

   * SLURM support (Suchandra): so far, so good … any blockers for release in 3.1.22?
   * OSG Software 3.2 project: finish initial design document and start incorporating feedback (!TimC, Mat)
   * OSG WN client in OASIS: need to deal with CA/CRLs before 3.1.22? documentation; testing (Release) (Mat &rarr; !TimT)
   * osg-test improvements (!BrianL): help Srini finish the Gratia changes and possibly release them; possibly release the configuration file work; get back to GUMS tests, once …
   * GUMS (!BrianL, !JohnH): force GUMS build to use !jGlobus RPM, not its own copy
   * Running osg-test in VM universe in CHTC (!TimC): start experimenting with running in VM universe itself; figure out how to get and use a host certificate

---+++ HTCondor Projects

   * Unification of HTCondor RPMs (Carl): get feedback on final punch list; work on completing final tasks
   * Take on HTCondor Debian packaging (!BrianL): follow up with !BrianB and Alan about 8.0.1 build failures on Debian 7

---+++ Coming Soon

   * Big round of Globus Toolkit updates? (waiting for patches to be moved upstream, then subsequent release)
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure

---+++ Notes


---++ OSG Release Team

Today is the testing freeze for 3.1.22.  Think of this one as soft serve ice cream.  At this point, I would like to know about all tickets that are intended to go into 3.1.22.  In JIRA terms, be sure they are labeled 3.1.22.  If possible, they should be marked ready for testing.  This is to ensure that we can plan for the testing.  Please have tickets marked by the end of the day.

When marking tickets "Ready for Testing", please also mark them "Unassigned".

---+++ Accomplishments

   * Released [[InstallSoftwareWithOpenJDK7][Installing OSG Software to Use OpenJDK 7]]
   * CVMFS 2.1.12 tested (it is enough testing?)

---+++ Projects

   * Working on 3.1.22 (31 tickets targeted, 2 Ready for Release, 23 Ready for Testing, 6 In Progress)
   * Testing many tickets
   * Plan to release [[InstallOsgUpcomingSoftware][OSG Upcoming Software Repositories Installation Guide]]
   * Will add one more ticket for update VO data.

   * Document testing expertise on wiki as well as ITB site capabilities.

---+++ Notes

*JIRA Tickets:* !BrianL may be able to mark tickets "Unassigned" automatically on transition to "Ready for Testing".

*CVMFS 2.1.12 Testing:* Xin's testing of CVMFS is adequate. !BrianB noted that the code has already been tested well by the EGI folks.  Also, it is late minor release in a stable package.

*RSV Updates:* RSV should be tested by anyone running a CE or an SE. Neha should be able to test SE; Suchandra should be able to test CE and SE. Neha will ask Steve Timm if FNAL might have an ITB instance we could use for testing. RSV probes for ITB instances send data to the GOC, same as for production instances.

*OpenJDK 7:* Will formally announce deployment plan for Java 7.

*Testing expertise:* !TimT putting together a testing expertise and ITB site capability wiki page. Please send him your testing experience list.

*dCache-SRMClient:* Neha having trouble with dCache-SRMClient. Should talk to Mat -- very high priority.
