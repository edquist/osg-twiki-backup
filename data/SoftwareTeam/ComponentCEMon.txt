---+ OSG Software Component: CEMon

---++ Purpose

The CEMon service provides a common interface for publishing information about a Computing Element (CE). The framework can be configured with multiple sensors for collecting data from different sources, such as the [[ComponentGIP][Generic Information Provider]]. The information can be published in multiple formats, such as LDIF and !ClassAds. Conceptually, one can think of CEMon as being a cron job and a script that periodically pushes a data file to a web server, but in fact it is a giant Tomcat web application that implements similar functionality.

Currently in OSG, CEMon invokes the [[ComponentGIP][GIP]] every 5 minutes (or is it 10 minutes?).

---++ Usage

---++ Source

[[https://wiki.italiangrid.it/CEMon CEMon]] comes from EMI. Parag Mhashilkar from Fermilab used to work with CEMon and knows a lot about it.

---++ Packaging

---++ History

---++ Future

CEMon and GIP are stable and reliable, but people are not very happy with the setup. There is an alternative to CEMon called “osg-info-services” which is a relatively simple Python script. It has not been hardened for production use, but a few brave sites use it anyway.
