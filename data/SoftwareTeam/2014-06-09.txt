*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

   * Working on GUMS request from IF to return GIDs (REQUEST-62).  To 'warm up' toward this task and (re-)acquaint with the source code, a simplified interface for banning users was added .
      * This work will likely continue for this week; expect patches for lcmaps and bestman2.
   * Starting to plan, organize, and assist the rollout of HTCondor-CE.  Worked with the FNAL and Florida sites; hope to start with AGLT2 next week.
