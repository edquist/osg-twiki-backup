---++ Details

   1. All the packaged may be installed as root, but will be run by a user with non privileged account. This admin user  should be able start/stop the system and change configuration files. It should not require that root be used in any manner except for machine configuration. Configuration files should be in /etc/xrootd directory.
   1. The RPM should be installed in FHS locations, /opt/xrootd, or be relocatable.
   1.  For the time being the simple authentication is enough but eventually (date unspecified) X509 authentication will be required 
   1. The installed package should be functional out of the box , e.g it should be no need to change anything to have functional xrootd data server and cmsd running on the node. The client should be able to copy and retrieve file accessing node directly.
   1. The start and stop scripts and configuration of the following daemons should be available on each xrootd node:
      A. xrootd
      A. cmsd
      A. frm
