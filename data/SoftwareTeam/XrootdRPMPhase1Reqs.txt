---+ Xrootd RPM Phase 1 Requirements

---++ Packages needed
   * xrootd-server 
   * xrootd-client 
   * xrootdfs
   * !GridFTP with xrootd DSI plugin

---++ Platforms

   * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (and compatible, particular Scientific Linux 5)
   * Both 32 and 64 bit. 

---++ Details

   1. Xrootd should be provided as an RPM. (And therefore it's okay to install as root.)
   1. The xrootd daemons should run as a non-privileged user. (If we choose a non-standard user such as the xrootd user, that user may need to be created as part of the installation.)
   1. ATLAS system administrators need to be able to configure their system such that they can provide a non-root user with the ability to start and stop the xrootd processes and change configuration files. 
   1. The RPM should be installed in FHS locations.
   1. The package should support Xrootd's "simple" authentication.
   1. Upon completion of the RPM installation, the client should be able to copy and retrieve file accessing node directly.
   1. The start and stop scripts and configuration of the following daemons should be available on each xrootd node:
      A. xrootd
      A. cmsd
      A. frm
      A. xrootdfs
