---+ Xrootd RPM Phase 1 Requirements

---++ Packages needed
   * xrootd-server 
   * xrootd-client 
   * xrootdfs
   * !GridFTP with xrootd DSI plugin

---++ Platforms

   * Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (and compatible, particular Scientific Linux 5)
   * Both 32 and 64 bit. 

---++ Details

   1. Xrootd should be provided as an RPM. (And therefore it's okay to install as root.)
   1. The xrootd daemons should run as a non-privileged user. (If we choose a non-standard user such as the xrootd user, that user may need to be created as part of the installation.)
   1. It should be relatively easy for ATLAS system administrators to configure their system such that they can provide a non-root user with the ability to start and stop the xrootd processes and change configuration files. (Perhaps via sudo or permissions--details here are left to ATLAS Tier-3s.)
   1. The RPM should be installed in FHS locations, /opt/xrootd, or be relocatable.
   1.  For the time being the simple authentication is enough but eventually (date unspecified) X509 authentication will be required 
   1. The installed package should be functional out of the box , e.g it should be no need to change anything to have functional xrootd data server and cmsd running on the node. The client should be able to copy and retrieve file accessing node directly.
   1. The start and stop scripts and configuration of the following daemons should be available on each xrootd node:
      A. xrootd
      A. cmsd
      A. frm
      A. xrootdfs
