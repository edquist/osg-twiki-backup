---+ Project 24: Consolidate OSG Software Distribution Repositories

The goal of this project is to consolidate all public OSG software distribution repositories on a single host (repo.grid.iu.edu) to reduce user confusion and maintenance costs.

---++ The Problem

As of October 2015, OSG software is distributed from at least two hosts:
   * repo.grid.iu.edu contains the OSG Yum repositories (at least)
   * software.grid.iu.edu contains OSG CA certificate tarballs and Debian packages (at least)

This situation confuses users, operations, support, and even developers, especially because software.grid.iu.edu is used lightly and often by automated tools only. Further, OSG Operations is maintaining two public software distribution hosts when one would suffice.

---++ Deliverables

   * Consolidate all public OSG software distribution repositories on a single host (repo.grid.iu.edu)
   * Remove the software.grid.iu.edu host
   * Document for OSG internal use the top-level filesystem/URL hierarchy of the software host

---++ Scope

   * This project is *not* about evaluating the worth of the contents of software.grid.iu.edu. If we encounter files and directories on software that are obviously no longer necessary, we will not copy them to repo.grid.iu.edu. But any such decisions that are beyond trivial are out of scope for this project.

---++ Risks

   * We have done a poor job of keeping track of who uses software.grid.iu.edu and for what purposes, so there is the risk of breaking an existing but unknown use case. To mitigate, we will survey the contents of the software host carefully, check with OSG teams about known use cases, and work with identified stakeholders to ensure a smooth transition.

   * This project is low priority, so there is a risk of schedules slipping due to higher priority work. At the moment, there is nothing critical about the schedule so this risk is acceptable as is.

---++ Milestones and Schedule

I propose an iterative scheduling approach, in which we settle on a schedule for each major WBS section as the preceding section wraps up.
