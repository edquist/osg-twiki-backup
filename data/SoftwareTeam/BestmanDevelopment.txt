---+ Bestman development process

---++ Subversion repository

The Subversion repository is hosted at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and owned by the SRM group there. 

The Subversion repository for Bestman can be browsed online at: https://codeforge.lbl.gov/scm/?group_id=54

It also has instructions for doing anonymous checkouts. If you need commit privileges, talk to Alex Sim.

As of today, OSG Staff Neha Sharma, Doug Strain, and Alain Roy all have commit privileges. 

---++ Development process

The LBNL team will rarely make commits to the Bestman repository. When they do, they will inform us. 

The LBNL team would like to look over our commits for the foreseeable future,  so they can be sure there are no unintended consequences. They do have more experience with the code base. Therefore, the process to commit is:

   1. We develop whatever change we need.
   1. We email the patch to srm@lbl.gov for review. 
   1. The SRM team will provide feedback. 
   1. When approved, we can directly commit to the repository. 
   1. If the patch requires further work, the SRM team will either commit that work, or let us know what we should do.

---++ Cutting a release
When we want to cut a new release, we will:

   1. Agree on a new version number with the SRM team at srm@lbl.gov
   1. Commit any needed changes (including version number changes) as above.
   1. Use Subversion tags to label the release.
