---+!! Proposal for repository of upcoming software (osg-upcoming)

Underlying ticket: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-883][SW-883]]

%TOC%

---++ Overview

TODO


---++ Process for packaging upcoming software

   1. Put package files in the upcoming software svn area ( =$SVN/native/redhat/upcoming= )
   1. osg-build the package, passing the =--upcoming= flag
   1. Install osg-release, and osg-upcoming-release; install and test the package.%BR%
      The main osg repos still need to be enabled so the package can get prerequisities.
   1. Package follows the same promotion cycle that regular packages follow (development &rarr; testing &rarr; prerelease &rarr; release), use osg-promote to promote

It hasn't been decided whether or not "upcoming" should be released in sync with the regular osg releases.

---++ Initial list of software to be placed in upcoming

   * hadoop 2.0
   * java packages rebuilt as part of Java6MigrationProject

---++ Todo lists


---+++ What to do in Koji

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* |
| Make and document the following tags: =el[56]-osg-upcoming-{release,prerelease,testing,development,build}= | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Make and document the following targets: =el[56]-osg-upcoming= ( =el[56]-osg-upcoming-build -> el[56]-osg-upcoming-development= ) | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Get GOC to use mash on the new tags | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | ? |
| Add appropriate policies (ACLs) for various actions on the upcoming tags/targets <sup>1</sup> | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 2&mdash;4 hours |
   
1. Proposed ACLs:
   * packages in &#42;-upcoming-development can be tagged &#42;-upcoming-testing
   * packages in &#42;-upcoming-testing can be tagged &#42;-upcoming-prerelease
   * packages in &#42;-upcoming-prerelease can be tagged &#42;-upcoming-release
   * allow tagging from &#42;-upcoming-release; to &#42;-osg-testing only.

---+++ What to do in SVN

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* |
| Make =$SVN/native/redhat/upcoming/{branches,trunk}= and copy or move packages that are going to be in upcoming; document this | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Create an =osg-upcoming-release= rpm with the new repos; document this | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |

---+++ What to do in osg-build

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* | 
| Add and document promotion paths to =osg-promote= | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Add easy way to specify building in upcoming (for example a =--upcoming= flag); document this | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 4&mdash;8 hours |
| Add some way of making sure builds don't use the wrong target by default <sup>1</sup> | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 4&mdash;8 hours |

1. This can be done perhaps by selecting target based on SVN branch (unless otherwise specified).
Koji can't automatically do this for us

---+++ What to do in osg-test

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* | 
| Go through each of our test cases and make sure they handle which version of the software they are testing properly. \
  E.g. do the hadoop tests either work with both 0.20 and 2.0.0 or at least test which one is installed and make the right configs | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;3 days |
| Create and document an =osg-tested-internal= equivalent for packages we test in upcoming; it may be smaller than the original =osg-tested-internal= because we shouldn't have to test components that we've already tested in the regular nightlies and haven't been affected by anything in upcoming | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 2&mdash;4 hours |
| Add upcoming to our nightlies <sup>1</sup> | %ORANGE%Recommended%ENDCOLOR% | | 4&mdash;8 hours |

1. This doubles the number of tests we run, but currently, our tests take under an hour to run and are given two-hour time-slots, so this is doable.

---+++ What to do in documentation

| *Task* | *Priority* | *Status* | *Time Estimate* | 
| A separate SoftwareTeam.PreReleaseNotes page for packages promoted to upcoming-testing | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| An addition to SoftwareTeam.UpcomingReleases for upcoming changes to upcoming | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Update to our development instructions, for example SoftwareTeam.RPMDevelopmentGuide, SoftwareTeam.OSGBuildTools, SoftwareTeam.ReleasePolicy, and others | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 4&mdash;8 hours |
| Instructions on how to enable the upcoming repos that can be included in instructions for specific software much like Documentation.Release3.YumRepositories currently is | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | 1&mdash;2 hours |
| Instructions for specific software that we place in upcoming, e.g. hadoop-2.0.0; these should also contain migration instructions if possible | %RED%Required%ENDCOLOR% | | ? |
