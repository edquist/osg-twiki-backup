---+++ Notes

---++ Bonus Discussions

---+++ Software triage duties

Need to figure out what to do about software triage since we are splitting the team. Obvious options:

   1. Software team only
   2. Software and release teams
   3. Investigations, software, and release teams

!TimT said that he was fine with option #2, so we just need to check with !BrianB about option #3.

---+++ JIRA

The Release team “owns” the FixVersion field now — they will set it once a ticket is certainly assigned to a release.

Everyone else can propose releases in the Label field, i.e., marking when we hope to release a ticket.
