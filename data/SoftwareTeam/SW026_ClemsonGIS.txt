---+ Flock Clemson GIS Jobs to UW–Madison

---++ Milestones

   * Set ACTIVE = &mdash;&nbsp;<span style="color: white; background-color: #0A0; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;">in&nbsp;progress</span>
   * Set DONE = &mdash;&nbsp;<span style="color: white; background-color: #000; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 3px;">done</span>
-->

---+++ Phase I - Networking

The goal is to ensure that there is connectivity between relevant HTCondor nodes at UW and Clemson.

   * UW Moate talk to !DoIT about allowing Clemson jobs and firewall changes %ACTIVE%
   * Clemson provide IP address range(s) %DONE%
   * UW !DoIT open firewall holes for Clemson machines
   * UW provide IP address range(s) %ACTIVE%
   * Clemson open firewall holes for UW machines
   * UW create condor_ping commands to test connectivity from UW to Clemson and back
   * Both test and repeat until all connections work

---+++ Phase II - Basic flocking

The goal is to run trivial, non-GIS jobs from one Clemson submit host on the UW pool.

   * UW suggest basic flocking configuration (FLOCK_TO)
   * UW make local configuration changes to accept flocking from Clemson submit hosts
   * Clemson add flocking configuration to one submit host
   * Both test flocking of “Hello World” job(s) from single submit host

---+++ Phase III - Make flocking opt-in (only)

The goal is to require an extra attribute in a Clemson submit file to enable flocking to UW.

   * UW suggest configuration for making flocking opt-in
   * Clemson add configuration for making flocking opt-in
   * Both test opt-in flocking from single submit host

---+++ Phase IV - Run a GIS job

The goal is to identify and run at least one Clemson GIS job at UW.

   * Clemson work with CHTC, ACI-REF, and users to prepare jobs to run remotely
   * Clemson identify a pilot user
   * Clemson run one real(istic) GIS job at Wisconsin

---+++ Phase V - Complete the deployment

The goal is to finish deploying the flocking changes to all Clemson GIS submit hosts.

   * Clemson expand flocking configuration to multiple submit hosts
   * Both test opt-in flocking from additional submit hosts
