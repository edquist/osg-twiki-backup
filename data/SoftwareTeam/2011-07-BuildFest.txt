---++ Primary Goals

   1. Get the OSG Software Team synchronized and working towards our strategy for packaging the OSG Software Stack as RPMs. 
   1. Train members of the team so they are all capable of making RPMs with the VDT's infrastructure

---++ Secondary Goal
We also want to package as much of the VDT as we can. How much is realistic to do during a three day meeting? We'll see.
