---+ Mass RPM Rebuilds in Koji

Whenever we move to a new OSG series (OSG 3.3) and/or a new RHEL version (EL7), we want to make new builds for all of our packages in the new koji build target (osg-3.3-el7).

Due to tricky build dependencies and unexpected build failures, this can be a messy task; and in the past we have gone about it in an ad-hoc manner.

This document will discuss some of the aspects of the task and issues involved, some possible appoaches, and ultimately a proposal for a general tool or procedure for doing our mass rebuilds.
