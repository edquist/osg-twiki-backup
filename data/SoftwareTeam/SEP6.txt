---++ Note on this SEP
This SEP is being written before the idea of SEPs has been explored and accepted in OSG. Acceptance of this SEP is contingent upon the SEP idea being accepted.

---++ Proposed changes in OSG 1.2.10.

This is the list of changes we propose to have in OSG 1.2.10. (That is, these are the differences from OSG 1.2.9.) 

The precise versions may change as we proceed with testing.

   * RSV Updates
      * Add rsv-control, a new tool to simplify management and configuration of RSV
      * Add new information services (GIP) metrics
      * Add new !ReSS metrics 
   * Add FTS clients [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/Ticket/Display.html?user=guest&pass=guest&id=6048][VDT Ticket #56048]]


---++ Schedule
We plan to begin testing OSG 1.2.10 in mid to late April, after OSG 1.2.9 is released.
