---+ OSG Software Component: Generic Information Provider (GIP)

---++ Purpose

The GIP gathers information about the current state of a Compute Element (CE). This is information such as, “the site is running OSG 3.1.8, uses Condor, has 1000 batch slots of which 959 are in use”. Of course, there is a ton more data than that. You can think of it as describing what a site offers.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

The GIP comes from CMS. Our main contacts for the GIP are Burt Holzman and Tony Tiradani at Fermilab. The GIP is pretty straightforward Python code. Brian used to hack on GIP and knows a lot about it.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

---++ Future

CEMon and GIP are stable and reliable, but people are not very happy with the setup. There is an alternative to CEMon called “osg-info-services” which is a relatively simple Python script. It has not been hardened for production use, but a few brave sites use it anyway.
