*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions


---+++ Support Update

   * Cancer Computer (!BrianL) - CE up and running! Still some solutions to be fleshed out on the UW frontend so that VO sub-projects are recognized
   * Caltech (!BrianL) - Found that jobs removed at the CE-level count as 'failed' jobs in the job routing table, which leads to job throttling ([[https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/tktview?tn=5968][Gittrac#4968]])

---+++ Discussion

   * Problem: HTCondor 8.5.7 does not interact properly with HTCondor-CE 2.0.9. We will investigate and possibly not release HTCondor 8.5.7.
   * CVMFS 2.3.2 will probably need to be promoted so LIGO can utilize it on the OSG.

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Busy with CHEP.
   * GIP publishes queue information, but that's not available from HTCondor-CE -- need to convince people that it's not necessary or come up with an alternate solution.

---+++ Last Week

   * Work done with USATLAS to help them replace SRM at one of their sites -- maybe OU or SLAC
   * USATLAS looking at AGIS compatibility layer for the collector.  GOC Collector is now working!  Atlas needs some queue information though.
   * !BrianB considering using a lightweight container API called Singularity as a replacement for glExec;
     opened a ticket for testing their packaging, and writing a wrapper for Condor jobs to use

---+++ Ongoing
   * Gratia V2: Derek will be working on this.  Jira project is starting to take shape: [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/GRACC/][GRACC]].  Project documentation located at https://opensciencegrid.github.io/gracc.
   * !StashCache monitoring and testing has been vastly improved.  Thanks to summer student at !UChicago.  Still ongoing!
