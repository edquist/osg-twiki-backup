*Attending:* Anand Padmanabhan, Brian Bockelman, John Hover, Marco Mambelli, Neha Sharma, Suchandra Thapa, Tim Cartwright

The initial list of topics to discuss:

   * SHA-2
   * GUMS config file
   * Interoperability / SAML
   * Pre-RFC proxies
   * XACML interface
   * Hibernate
   * Status of GUMS 1.4
   * Logging issues
   * Binary !JARs
   * Shortcut link
   * Upgrade problems from Pacman
   * Strategy for banning
   * Timing of changes

Each topic was discussed and is documented in a section below.

---++ SHA-2 Certificate Handling

As part of his [[Sha2Support][ongoing SHA-2 testing]], Suchandra has completed some basic GUMS tests using SHA-2 certificates (host and user proxy). At first, he encountered fatal errors, which were initially attributed to the aged copy of the EMI trustmanager that ships with GUMS. However, further effort revealed that the errors resulted from misconfiguration. In the latest tests, GUMS works fine with the SHA-2 certificates, even in cases when GUMS contacts a VOMS server (with or without SHA-2 certificates itself). So at this time, we believe that GUMS is ready to handle SHA-2 certificates. However, our installation (and especially the upgrade) documentation needs to be updated to reflect current configuration practices.

Also, Brian noted that the old !jGlobus and !gLite trustmanager !JARs that ship with GUMS are not used for SSL, just (relatively) harmless utility functionality. The GUMS package ultimately depends on =emi-trustmanager=, which is fairly up-to-date at version 3.0.3.
