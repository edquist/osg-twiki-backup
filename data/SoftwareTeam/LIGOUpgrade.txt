---+ Requirements: LIGO Upgrade to SL6 and Debian 6

---+++ Background

LIGO is updating their supported platforms to Scientific Linux 6 and Debian 6, and they need the VDT to move with them. They will primarily use packages that now ship with EPEL and Debian, but need the VDT to fill in the gaps.

---++ Requirements

   1. For Red Hat 6, we are going to provide GSI-OpenSSH with mechglue.
   1. For Debian 6, we are going to provide GSI-OpenSSH with mechglue, MyProxy, and UberFTP
   1. %RED%Tim--Can you fill in details on init script here?%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Timeline (Tentative)

We are going to start this work in mid-August (now), and provide you with these by mid to late September.
