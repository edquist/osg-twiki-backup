---++ Job Environment

For any Globus-based job run on a OSG CE resource, the following must be true of the environment:
   1 $OSG_GRID must be defined.
   1 After sourcing =$OSG_GRID/setup.sh= or =$OSG_GRID/setup.csh=, the contents of the OSG worker node software must be in the job's environment.
      * Here, the "contents of the OSG worker node software" must match the software packages deployed by some version of the OSG wn-client package.
      * The major version number of the wn-client package must match the major version number of the OSG CE service.  Examples are given below.
   1 The environment must be such that Condor-G grid_monitor functions.
      * Practically, this means that for jobs running in jobmanager-fork, $GLOBUS_LOCATION must point to the $GLOBUS_LOCATION of the CE.

---++ Motivation 

Experience has shown that sites are very responsive to the needs of a VO which owns the resource.  However, as opportunistic usage of the OSG has begun to accelerate, we have found that each VO has a slightly different interpretation of the job environment (for both batch system jobs and fork jobs).  This results in many VOs asking sites for different customizations to suit their needs.  Feedback from sites shows they can find these multiple, differing requests confusing - there's no clear guidance from the OSG on whether the VO requests are considered reasonable.

The primary motivation of this SEP is threefold:
   1 Manage expectations for the opportunistic VO.  This will help VOs moderate requests and understand what they can expect from an opportunistic site.
   1 Inform sites of the OSG's policy.  This will provide guidance on how they should deploy OSG software in such a manner that they can satisfy most VOs.
   1 Keep OSG's policy consistent.  Wiki-based documentation changes with time and policies can inadvertently be reversed.  This SEP is meant to serve as an official statement.

---++ Actionable Items.

The OSG does not like to "punish sites" or make central decisions for them.  However, in order to be fair to users, we do ask sites

If a VO encounters a site that doesn't follow this policy, we recommend they file a ticket with the OSG GOC.  The GOC will follow the following actions:
   1 Work with the site to deploy their software in such a manner that it meets this policy.
   1 Help the site to stop advertising access to opportunistic VOs.

We believe OSG sites are not malicious; we find them to usually be helpful and responsive.  If not in compliance with a policy or best practice, it is usually due to poor communication or documentation from the OSG, and they are happy to make changes if the OSG is willing to help them.

If a site does not want to change their software environment or remove access in the information services, OSG Operations will defer to the Executive Board to determine what action to take next.

---++ Anti-Examples

We want to narrowly restrict the purview of this proposal.  This proposal
   * Does not propose to add or remove packages from the OSG WN-client.  The contents of the WN-client is a separate issue.
   * Does not say how the software should be installed.  The software components should be made available - we did not say that the pacman wn-client package must be installed.
      * For example, if a site wants to hand-install the necessary software, and hand write their own setup.sh file, they may.  However, the OSG wouldn't be able to provide software support in such a case!
      * A site might want to meet these requirements by exporting the CE install via NFS to the worker node.  THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  However, this would meet the requirements.
   * Does not require $OSG_GRID to be in the same location on the CE and worker node, or even in the same directory on all the worker nodes.

---++ Example software configurations

Here are different ways that a site might meet the SEP requirements:
   1 (Recommended)  Install the wn-client package locally on every worker node.  Install the ce package locally on the OSG CE.  Install the wn-client package into the same directory on the OSG-CE.
   1 Install the wn-client package into the CE install directory, and export the CE install directory via NFS to all worker nodes.
   1 If wn-client cannot be put into the same directory name on all the worker nodes, the site may use batch-system provided hooks in order to change the value of OSG_GRID on a per-node basis.  For Condor, this can be done in the job wrapper; for PBS, this can be done in the job's prologue script.
