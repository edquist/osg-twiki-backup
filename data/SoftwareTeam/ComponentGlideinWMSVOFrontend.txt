---+ OSG Software Component: !GlideinWMS VO Frontend

---++ Purpose

Think of this as a Condor submit host (that is, it runs the =condor_schedd=). Through magic (i.e., the Glidein factory), it can create a Condor pool using various worker nodes in OSG sites. Quite a few VOs now use !GlideinWMS.

---++ Usage

---++ Source

OSG owns the !GlideinWMS software, mostly Igor Sfiligoi and Doug Strain.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.
