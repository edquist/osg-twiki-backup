*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

Late Monday, we decided to do a "emergency" release for osg-configure, due to the fact the we introduced a bug and wanted to limit exposure.  (2 GOC tickets already.)  The focus of the release is osg-configure and pulled and missing testing from the 3.1.23 release.  No new rebuilds (except osg-configure), if testing reveals a problem, ticket gets pushed the next release.

Need input from !BrianB on SOFTWARE-1172 to move forward.
