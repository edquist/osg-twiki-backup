---+ OSG Software Team Meeting, 3 December 2012

*Attending:* Mat, Tim, Suchandra, Marco, Doug, Neha, Jeff Dost

---++ Announcements

*Triage Duty:* Neha this week, Mat next week; %RED%17 open tickets%ENDCOLOR%.

*OSG Deployments:* OSG 3.x: 55 (–2) last week; 15 (+2) using 3.1.11; OSG 1.2: 48 (–1) sites, 1 (+1) using 1.2.31.

*Request: Upcoming time off*

---++ Accomplishments

GUMS: Mandatory dependency sorting-out is done; there are extras we can tackle, but depends on time.


---++ Issues

%RED%Work with Tim to make sure work is reflected in JIRA and that tickets are resolved/closed when done.%ENDCOLOR%

   * !BeStMan/jGlobus: test failures, broader testing, release timing, etc.
   * GUMS: jGlobus dependency (see notes)
   * !XRootD: 3.2.6 has broken GSI on el5; 3.3.0 update delayed until January. Insufficient demand for xrootd on el6 to justify releasing 3.2.6 on el6 only.
   * !GlideinWMS (see notes)
   * osg-configure bug fixes; need to be tested in ITB first.
   * voms-api-java: is it needed? why? should we ship it?

---+++ Ongoing

   * Upgrade to fetch-crl3 on el5 (for January release?)
   * Pakiti (in testing)
   * SLURM
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure
   * Help debug Texas Tech (Alan Sill et al.), Caltech (Steven Lo), and Oklahoma (Horst)

---+++ Coming Soon(ish)

   * New “Upcoming” repository, initially for HDFS 2.0 (January)
   * HTCondor name change (pending, eventually)
   * CVMFS (for OASIS) (January)
   * HTCondor-CE (February)

---++ Actions

   * Refine December release goals and target date (Tim)
   * !BeStMan: %RED%Resolve test failures%ENDCOLOR% (Neha)
   * !BeStMan: Identify documentation changes in a ticket or declare that there are none (Neha)
   * !BeStMan: Scalability testing (Jeff)
   * !BeStMan: Get commitments for ITB testing (Suchandra, with help from others as needed)

   * SLURM CE: Continue development and testing (Suchandra)
   * GUMS: Work on library improvements (Doug)
   * HDFS: Work on bugs in 2.0.0 (Doug), finish new HDFS tests (Doug)
   * Request !jPackage archive at Wisconsin (Mat)
   * Write new VOMS Admin automated tests (Mat)
   * Design next step for testing infrastructure (Tim, Mat)
   * Help with TTU and Caltech debugging as needed (Suchandra)
   * Write a more explicit proposal for dealing with the LCMAPS packaging changes (Tim)
   * Triage Globus patches for upstream (Tim, Brian)

---++ Notes

---+++!! GUMS
GUMS currently depends on the old package =cog-jglobus=, which is now replaced by =jglobus=, but =bestman= depends on =gums=.
This results in both =cog-jglobus= and =jglobus= being installed.
It's possible to work around this with classpath magic, but a better solution would be to replace the =cog-jglobus= dependency in GUMS, but that might require modifications in GUMS.
We should run it past John Hover and/or Brian.

---+++!! !GlideInWMS
Version 2.6.2 is in =osg-testing=.
UCSD has tested the software for a month, but they didn't install it from the RPM.
The package has two parts: the VO frontend, and the factory; the frontend gets more use, so it's more important to test, but both come from the same SRPM.
Therefore, light testing of both RPMs is necessary.
Doug suggests recruiting Derek for the testing.
Suchandra can also test the VO frontend.
ITB testing is not needed (since it would just go to Suchandra anyway).
