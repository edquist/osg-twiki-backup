---+ RPM Transition Timeline

<!--   Define clearly! -->

This is a high-level view of our timeline for the RPM transition with links to details for interested parties. 

---++ Release Process 

For each functional unit in the VDT, we will proceed through a series of steps, shown here:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/rpm-package-process.png" alt="rpm-package-process.png"/>

The tables below show when we complete each step--they are milestones, not periods of time for each state. 

---+++ Definition of steps
%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_MORE%}%
*1. Package* <br>
This is the time where we will construct the set of RPMs for the given functional unit. *Note:* We expect some very basic documentation at this point.

*2. Internal Testing* <br>
This is the time where we do basic, hands-on developer testing of the RPMs.

*3. Fix known problems* <br>
We are allocating time to fix problems. While it is hard to know what problems we will encounter, we recognize that we will make an educated guess so that when we run into the inevitable problems, fixing them fits into our schedule. 

*4a. Documentation* <br>
This is the time when we move the existing basic documentation to something that fits into our documentation structure and is usable by end-users.

*4b. Evaluation* <br>
Two kinds of evaluations might happen here. First, we might do an extensive internal evaluation for scalability or readiness. (For instance, evaluating the scalability of GRAM 5.) Second, we will work with friendly external testers to get feedback. 

*4c. Integration Testbed* <br>
Testing by the integration testbed. 

*5. Release* <br>
The production release.

---++ Weekly Highlights

| *Date* | *Note* |
| 3-Aug-2011 | We have completed internal testing on the OSG client and the VOMS server!<br>We are nearly ready for the OSG site admin meeting, except for some minor glexec issues and basic docs for glexec and the OSG client |

<!-- Add Documentation  --> 

---++ Functional Unit: glexec

---++ Functional Unit: GUMS
We will package GUMS before the end of the year if possible. This is a low priority goal: we will focus on the CE and exclude GUMS if necessary. For the short-term this is acceptable because GUMS can still be installed via Pacman.

|  *Milestone*  |  *State*  |  *Target*  |   *Actual*  |  *Notes*  |

---++ Functional Unit: Gratia Collector
This is a low priority goal: we are not aiming to have progress on it during 2011 unless we have spare time.

|  *Milestone*  |  *State*  |  *Target*  |   *Actual*  |  *Notes*  |
