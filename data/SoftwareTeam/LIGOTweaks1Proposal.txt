---+ Proposal — Project 4 — LIGO Debian Packaging Tweaks

---++ Requirements

---+++ Concise Statement

After an initial release to production of Globus Toolkit 5.0.2 and related packages, subsequent use turned up a few minor issues with the Debian packages. This project aims to fix the issues.

---+++ Deadline

No specific deadline has been requested.

---+++ Stakeholders

LIGO

---++ Proposed Scope of Work

Make the following updates:

   * Add an ld.so.conf.d file to vdt-globus-common, so that Globus Toolkit shared libraries can be found by Python bindings.
   * Run ldconfig as appropriate during install and removal to pick up the ld.so.conf.d change.
   * Change version dependency declarations to use a variable instead of a hard-coded number.

After the changes are made, the following source packages will need to be rebuilt, tested, given to LIGO for testing, and ultimately promoted to production.

   * vdt-globus-toolkit
   * vdt-myproxy

---++ Proposed WBS

*Note:* For our estimates of effort, we are using “FTE weeks” according to Chander’s definition: “1 FTE week (at CS UW-Madison) is the amount of work that can be reasonably completed by 1 person in one week working on one task (at CS UW-Madison). This implicitly covers all the overheads and interrupts that occur in this environment.” Thus, actual calendar time may be greater, if other projects or delays intervene.

| *WBS* | *Task* | *Estimate* | *Notes* |
| *1* | *Make changes* |||
| 1.1 | Update Globus Toolkit to use ld.so.conf | 3 FTE hours| Includes metadata updates, test build, and test install |
| 1.2 | Update !MyProxy dependency | 1 FTE hours| Includes metadata updates, test build, and test install |
| *2* | *Build packages* |||
| 2.1 | Do final build of vdt-globus-toolkit | 1 FTE hours| |
| 2.2 | Do final build of vdt-myproxy | 1 FTE hours| |
