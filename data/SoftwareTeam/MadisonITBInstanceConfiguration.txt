---+ Configuration for the Madison ITB Instance


---++ Overview


Configuration for the Madison ITB Instance is handled using [[http://docs.puppetlabs.com][Puppet]].
We are using a Puppet Master that is run by the UW Center for High-Throughput Computing.
The master is shared by multiple sites, but we will have separate environments for the ITB site.


---++ Environment Setup


The Puppet Master we use is hosted on _wid-service-1.chtc.wisc.edu_.
All Puppet environments on _wid-service-1.chtc.wisc.edu_ are located in the directory =/etc/puppet/environments/=.

*Note*: _wid-service-1_ is a shared resource, and there are Puppet environments for other machines and clusters managed by the !CHTC.
Please be careful when making changes!

The =vdt= environment holds the Puppet configuration for the ITB site;
it is located in =/etc/puppet/environments/vdt/=.

In addition to the =vdt= environment, team members will have their own environments for testing.
Your environment will be named after your UW CS login name;
if you do not have an environment, you should mail Tim C or Mat.
You can manage your own environment however you want,
but it is recommended to store the configs in the [[https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/puppet][/puppet/ directory tree in SVN]].

A Puppet environment is a directory with a specific layout.
All Puppet configs in an environment are organized into modules and placed in the =modules/= subdirectory.
The [[http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/2.7/reference/modules_fundamentals.html][Puppet docs on modules]] describe this.

The special module =nodes= contains the configs for each specific host in the site.
Each node-specific config file is named after the hostname of the host it refers to.
For example, the config for _itb-worker1.chtc.wisc.edu_ is in the =itb-worker1.pp= file.
It contains a single "node" resource, which must be named after the !FQDN of the host.


---++ SVN Setup


The canonical location for files in the =vdt= environment is in the [[https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn][VDT SVN repo]],
in the directory =/puppet/production/=.
All changes to the =vdt= environment must be committed there.
The =vdt= environment on _wid-service-1_ updates from SVN every 10 minutes.

*Note* that this is a publicly accessible SVN repository.
Do not store any sensitive data such as passwords or private keys in it.

There are directories in the =/puppet/= tree for the ITB site admins' personal environments.
You should commit your changes to your environment into your area in SVN and from there merge the changes into production.
There is no automatic process to update admins' personal environments.
Use whatever method fits your workflow the best.


---++ Puppet Agent Setup


The puppet agent is installed on each of the nodes in the ITB site.
It is not running persistently, but instead runs once a night from root's cron.
The agent will pull from the =vdt= environment.


---++ Example Workflow


Suppose I (matyas) want to make a change to _itb-worker1_.
This is the procedure I would follow:
   1. Merge any changes that are in =/puppet/production/= to =/puppet/matyas/= to make sure my branch reflects the current state of the configs.
   1. SSH to _wid-service-1_, cd into the checkout at =/etc/puppet/environments/matyas/= and update from my branch.
   1. Make changes (right there in the checkout).
   1. SSH to _itb-worker1_ and run <code>puppetd -vt --environment=matyas</code> to run Puppet once, pulling from my environment.
   1. Repeat the previous two steps as necessary to get my changes working.
   1. Commit my changes to =/puppet/matyas/=.
   1. Acquire permission to merge to production.
   1. SVN merge my changes to =/puppet/production/=.
   1. Wait up to 10 minutes.
   1. SSH to _itb-worker1_ and run <code>puppetd -vt --environment=vdt</code>.
   1. Verify my changes work in production.
