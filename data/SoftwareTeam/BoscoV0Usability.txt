---+ Plan for Usability Testing of Bosco Version 0

%RED%This is not yet a plan!!%ENDCOLOR% Alain is studying and working on it. This is accumulating his ideas until they are crystallized.

---++ %RED%Risk to timeline: Human Subjects Research%ENDCOLOR%

<b>%RED%Please Note:%ENDCOLOR%</b>This may fall under Human Subjects Research. If it does, it's subject to regulations. Alain is investigating. This could have a serious impact on the plan

---++ What is usability?

From [1]:

<blockquote>
Usability is not a quality that exists in any real of absolute sense. Perhaps it can be best summed up as being a general quality of the <i>appropriateness to a purpose</i> of any particular artefact.
</blockquote>

---++ Limits to current phase of usability testing

Thorough usability testing is an art and a science. Given the short time-frame and lack of in-house experience, we are going to limit the scope of usability testing. Good usability testing should include a fair number of candidate subjects, multiple rounds of testing, etc. Our goal is to gain insight into the usability we have in a cost-effectie way.

---++ Inputs for the usability testing

Our usability testing requires are few things to be in place before it can begin.

   1. The software must be ready for usability testing.
   1. An initial round of beta testing should be complete. The goal of usability testing is not to find bugs (though we welcome bug reports) but to understand the usability. Therefore basic bug fixing should be complete before usability testing begins. 
   1, There must be sufficient documentation for the user to be able to do all of the tasks required for the usability testing.

---++ System Usability Scale

I read about the System Usability Scale in [1] and [2], and it seems likely to be an excellent tool in our arsenal. It's a ten question questionnaire that can be used to determine the usability of an artifact. According to [2], it's been well studied and people have found it to consistently be a reliable measure of usability. Given that people more expert than me have studied it and agreed on it's utility, we should use it if we want to use a survey. 

   1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently	
   1. I found the system unnecessarily complex
   1. I thought the system was easy to use                      	
   1. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system	
   1. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated
   1. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system
   1. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly			
   1. I found the system very cumbersome to use
   1. I felt very confident using the system
   1. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system 	

This can be converted into a single number (0-100) to rate the usability. 

---++ Open Questions

   * Can we watch people while they use the system? 
   * What must be done before we can start the usability testing? (Documentation, product, beta testing... ?)
   * Who finds the testers?
   *
