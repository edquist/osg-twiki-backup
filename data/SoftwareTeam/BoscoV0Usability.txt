---+ Plan for Usability Testing of Bosco Version 0

%RED%This is not yet a plan!!%ENDCOLOR% Alain is studying and working on it. This is accumulating his ideas until they are crystallized.

---++ What is usability?

From [1]:

<blockquote>
Usability is not a quality that exists in any real of absolute sense. Perhaps it can be best summed up as being a general quality of the <i>appropriateness to a purpose</i> of any particular artefact.
</blockquote>

---++ Human Subjects Research

This may fall under Human Subjects Research. If it does, it's subject to regulations. Alain is investigating. 

---++ System Usability Scale

I read about the System Usability Scale in [1] and [2], and it seems likely to be an excellent tool in our arsenal. It's a ten question questionnaire that can be used to determine the usability of an artifact. According to [2], it's been well studied and people have found it to consistently be a reliable measure of usability. Given that people more expert than me have studied it and agreed on it's utility, we should use it if we want to use a survey. 

   1. I think that I would like to use this system frequently	
   1. I found the system unnecessarily complex
   1. I thought the system was easy to use                      	
   1. I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system	
   1. I found the various functions in this system were well integrated
   1. I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system
   1. I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly			
   1. I found the system very cumbersome to use
   1. I felt very confident using the system
   1. I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system 	

This can be converted into a single number (0-100) to rate the usability. 

---++ Open Questions

   * Can we watch people while they use the system? 
   * What must be done before we can start the usability testing? (Documentation, product, beta testing... ?)
   * Who finds the testers?
   *
