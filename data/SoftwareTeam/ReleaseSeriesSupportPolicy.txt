---+ OSG Software Release Series Support Policy

As of November 2013, the OSG software is available in multiple, parallel release series. For example, in early 2014 there are OSG 3.1 and 3.2 series of RPM releases available from separate repositories. This document describes the OSG policy for supporting release series, especially older ones. <span style="color: #F60;">As of 20 February 2014, this document is still in draft status.</span>

   * <p>For the first 3 months following a new release series, the Software team manager will _prefer_ to backport all changes into the old release series, except for disruptive updates.</p>
   * <p>For the first 6 months following a new release series, the Software team will backport changes into the old release series by stakeholder request or by the discretion of the Software manager.</p>
   * <p>After the first 6 months following a new release series, the Software team will backport fewer changes; specifically, they will backport bug fixes at the request of Production or critical security fixes.</p>
   * <p>6 months following a new release series, the Production manager will propose and seek consensus on an End-Of-Life date for the old release series, to be no less than 6 months later than the date on which the EOL is formally announced to the community.</p>
