|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">*</span> Due to the Labor Day federal holiday, the freeze date for 3.1.23 is delayed by one day.
