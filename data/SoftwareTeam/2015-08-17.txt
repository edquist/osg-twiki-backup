*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month.

---+++ Notes

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * Progress in testing !StashCache - increasingly good test results w.r.t. concurrency and performance under load. \
     Performance is so good it messes up the graphs
   * OASIS progressing fine; \
     Switching to some new storage targets in the ITB
   * José working on making !AutoPyFactory use the Condor Python bindings
