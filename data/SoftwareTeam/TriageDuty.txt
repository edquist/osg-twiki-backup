---+ Software Team Triage Duty

---++ Triage Rotation

We rotate triage duty for everyone who is on the team at least 50%. That is:

   * Alain Roy
   * Doug Strain
   * Matyas Selmeci
   * Neha Sharma
   * Suchandra Thapa
   * Tim Cartwright

Maxim will be on the list when he has a bit more experience. 

Open questions:
   * Is someone from UCSD on this list?
   * Is someone from BNL on this list?
