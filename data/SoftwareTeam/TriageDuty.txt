---++ Weekly email

An email goes out every Monday at 6 a.m. (Central Time) with the names of the staff on triage duty that week and on the following week. The script that sends out the email lives in SVN as =software/tools/email-triage-duty= and there's a checkout in =/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools= from where a cronjob runs it. The cronjob runs as the =cndrutil= user on =tonic.cs.wisc.edu= which is a RHEL 5 machine at UW-Madison. It looks like this:<pre>
