---+ Software Team Triage Duty

---++ Triage Rotation

We rotate triage duty for everyone who is on the team at least 50%. That is:

   * Alain Roy
   * Doug Strain
   * Suchandra Thapa
   * Neha Sharma
   * Matyas Selmeci
   * Tim Cartwright

Maxim will be on the list when he has a bit more experience. 

Open questions:
   * Is someone from UCSD on this list?
   * Is someone from BNL on this list?

---++ Triage Duty Calendar

The calendar is hosted on Alain Roy's Google Calendar account. If you need privileges to edit, just ask Alain.

---++ Weekly email

An email goes out every Monday at 6am with who's on triage duty that week and on the following week.
The script that sends out the email lives in SVN as =software/tools/email-triage-duty= and there's a checkout in =/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools= from where a cronjob runs it.
The cronjob runs as the =cndrutil= user on =tonic.cs.wisc.edu= which is a RHEL 5 machine at UW-Madison.
It looks like this:<pre>
0 6 * * 1 /s/std/bin/runauth /usr/bin/python /p/condor/workspaces/vdt/tools/email-triage-duty -u 'https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/dno3jlu8udb3pcj5c817flql1o%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics' -e osg-software@opensciencegrid.org</pre>
