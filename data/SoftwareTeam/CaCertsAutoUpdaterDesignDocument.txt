---+ Proposed Design for CA-Certs Auto-Updater package

A Python script running from cron is suitable enough for this. (Condor-Cron had been considered, but we decided that it is too heavyweight and most of cron's deficiencies can be solved by the script).

The main mechanism for doing the update is doing "yum update" on the individual ca-certs packages (such as =osg-ca-certs= or =igtf-ca-certs= ).
If the named package is not already installed, yum update will do nothing for that package, but give a warning.
Because of this, we are safe from a potential error caused by the software trying to install one ca-certs package on top of a different ca-certs package.

We maintain the ca-certs packages, so we have full control over the dependencies they bring in.
Because of this, we insure that no other parts of the user's system are touched by updating the ca-certs packages.

In order to reduce load on the repositories caused by multiple sites' systems all trying to update at the same time, the script will have a "random delay" option.
If this option is set, the script will wait for a random amount of time before trying to update.
=fetch-crl= also does this.

=yum= comes with locking built-in; if an existing yum process is running, a new yum process will wait until the previous one is finished before starting.
Because of this, we are not susceptible to problems caused by multiple copies of the script running simultaneously.

The updater script will write the time of the last successful update into a file.
Upon running, the script will compare the current time with the time of the last successful update.
The script will have a "minimum age" option to have a minimum elapsed time before attempting to update.
This allows us to avoid problems caused by (a) the system/crond being down when the update is scheduled, or (b) transient errors when the update is scheduled.
We can also have the script raise an error if an update was unsuccessful and the last successful update was too far in the past (as determined by a "maximum age" option).
=fetch-crl= also does the latter.

The RPM will install the cron job into =/etc/cron.d=.
There will be an init script in =/etc/rc.d/init.d= which, if started, creates a lock file under =/var/lock/subsys=; and if stopped, will remove the lock file.
The cron job will check for the existence of the lock file and it will not start the script if the lock file is missing.
This will make the updater look to the user as if it is a service, i.e. they start it via =service ca-certs-updater start=, or enable it on boot with =chkconfig ca-certs-updater on=.
=fetch-crl= also does this.

There will be a file in =/etc/sysconfig= that contains configurable parameters, as well as comments explaining their purpose and the parameter's default values.
