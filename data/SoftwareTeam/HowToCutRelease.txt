---+ How to Cut a Release

Due to the length of time that this process takes, it is recommended to do the release over two days to allow for errors to be corrected and because some of the koji commands take a long time to run when a large number of rpms are being released.

This document doesn't discuss the policy for deciding what goes into a release. [[SoftwareTeam.ReleasePolicy][The release policy is discussed elsewhere]].

%RED% *NOTE* Interactive scripts can be found at https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/release-tools/ and can be checked out with SVN.%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Pick the version number

This page will help you get the various commands exactly right. To do this, enter the exact version number (such as %RED%3.0.5%ENDCOLOR%) and click submit. If you do not do this, the commands below will be missing essential text.

<form action="https://www.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/SoftwareTeam/HowToCutRelease">
Version: <input type="text" name="version" size="10" value="%URLPARAM{"version"}%"/>
%IF{"$ 'URLPARAM{upcoming}'='true'"
then='Upcoming: <input type="checkbox" name="upcoming" value="true" checked="checked"/>'
else='Upcoming: <input type="checkbox" name="upcoming" value="true"/>'}%
<input type="submit"/>
</form>

---++ Day 0

---+++ Step 1: Update the osg-version RPM

Edit the osg-version RPM's spec file to update the version number to %VERSION%. Build it in koji:

<pre class="screen">
%RED%# If building for the latest release out of trunk:%ENDCOLOR%
osg-build koji osg-version
%RED%# If building for an older release out of a branch:%ENDCOLOR%
osg-build koji --repo=%MAJORVERSION% osg-version
</pre>

---+++ Step 2: Generate the tentative release list

The release manager often needs a preliminary list of packages slated for the next release a few weeks in advance. This is done by finding the package differences between what's in testing and what's in the current release. There is a script in SVN that handles this:

<pre class="screen">
%IF{"defined 'upcoming'"
then='./0-generate-pkg-list -u %VERSION%'
else='./0-generate-pkg-list %VERSION%'}%
</pre>

---++ Day 1: Populate Pre-release and Testing

---+++ Step 1: Test Pre-Release in VM Universe

Make sure you meet the [[SoftwareTeam.TestRunsAsVMs][pre-requisites]] required to submit VM Universe jobs on =osghost.ctc.wisc.edu=. After that's done, you can prepare the test suite by running:

<pre class="screen">
osg-run-tests -sl 'Testing OSG pre-release'
</pre>

After you =cd= into the directory specified in the output of the previous command, you will need to edit =test-parameters.yaml= to reflect the tests that you will want to run i.e. clean installs, upgrade installs and upgrade installs between OSG versions. 

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT% showlink="Click to expand an example test-parameters.yaml"}%
<pre class="file">
platform:
  - centos_5_x86_64
  - centos_6_x86_64
  - rhel_5_x86_64
  - rhel_6_x86_64
  - sl_5_x86_64
  - sl_6_x86_64

sources:
  - 3.1; osg-prerelease                      # Tests clean installs of 3.1 pre-release
  - 3.1; osg > osg-prerelease                # Tests update installs of 3.1 pre-release
  - 3.2; osg-prerelease                      # Tests clean installs of 3.2 pre-release
  - 3.2; osg > osg-prerelease                # Tests update installs of 3.2 pre-release
  - 3.1; osg-prerelease > 3.2/osg-prerelease # Tests update installs between 3.1 and 3.2 pre-release

packages:
  - [osg-tested-internal]
</pre>
%ENDTWISTY%

Once you're satisfied with your list of parameters, submit the dag:

<pre class="rootscreen">
condor_submit_dag master-run.dag
</pre>

%RED% *NOTE:* If there are failures, consult the release-manager before proceeding.%ENDCOLOR%

---+++ Step 2: Create the client tarballs

Create the client tarballs using the scripts in software/tarball-client/trunk from our SVN, and then copy them into the UW's AFS.
Do this as root on an EL6 fermicloud machine.
Change the username and machine name as appropriate.
Note: the prerelease repos must have been populated and regenerated for this to work;
normally that happens in Step 2.
<pre class="rootscreen">
ruser=%RED%matyas%ENDCOLOR%
rmachine=%RED%library.cs.wisc.edu%ENDCOLOR%
</pre><pre class="rootscreen">
mkdir -p /tmp/tarball-client
cd /tmp/tarball-client
svn export https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/tarball-client/trunk
trunk/make-client-tarball --osgver=%MAJORVERSION% --prerelease --all
scp *.tar.gz $ruser@$rmachine:/p/vdt/public/html/tarball-client/
</pre>
You should get 8 tarballs, 20-45 megs each.
They should all have %VERSION% in the name.

---+++ Step 3: Briefly test the client tarballs

As an *unprivileged user*, extract each tarball into a separate directory.
Make sure osg-post-install works. Make sure 'osgrun osg-version' works.

<pre class="screen">
for client in osg-client osg-wn-client; do
    for rhel in el5 el6; do
        for arch in i386 x86_64; do
            file=$client-%VERSION%-1.$rhel.$arch.tar.gz
            mkdir -p $rhel-$arch
            pushd $rhel-$arch
            tar xzf ../$file
            $client/osg/osg-post-install
            $client/osgrun osg-version
            popd
        done
    done
done
</pre>

If you have time, try some of the binaries, such as grid-proxy-init.

*NOTE:* We need to automate this and have it run on the proper architectures and version of RHEL.

---+++ Step 4: Update the UW AFS installation of the tarball client

The UW keeps an install of the tarball client in =/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client= on the UW's AFS.
There is a script to update it called =afs-install-tarball-client=. Run it as follows:
<pre class="screen">
/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/afs-install-tarball-client %VERSION%
</pre>

---+++ Step 5: Wait

Wait for clearance. The OSG Release Coordinator (in consultation with the Software Team and any testers) need to sign off on the update before it is released.  If you are releasing things over two days, this is a good place to stop for the day.

------

---++ Day 2: Pushing the Release

%RED% *NOTE:* For the second phase of the release, try to complete it earlier in the day rather than later. The GOC would like to send out the release announcement prior to 3 p.m. their time (Eastern time zone), which means that our procedure needs to be completed before then.%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Step 1: Push from pre-release to release

This script moves the packages into release, clones release into a new %VERSION% specific release repo, locks the new repo and regenerates it. Afterwards, it produces &#42;release-note* files that should be given to whomever's writing the release notes. 

<pre class="screen">
%IF{"defined 'upcoming'"
then='./2-create-release -u %VERSION%'
else='./2-create-release %VERSION%'}%
</pre>

*.txt files are also created and it should be verified that they've been moved to /p/vdt/public/html/release-info/ on UW's AFS.

---+++ Step 2: Upload the client tarballs

Ask Mat or someone with privileges on the grid.iu.edu repo servers to upload the tarballs with the following procedure:

---+++ On a CS machine
<pre class="screen">
cd /p/vdt/public/html/tarball-client
ssh jump.grid.iu.edu mkdir /tmp/%VERSION%/
scp *%VERSION%*gz jump.grid.iu.edu:/tmp/%VERSION%/
</pre>

---+++ On jump.grid.iu.edu
<pre class="screen">
scp -r /tmp/%VERSION% repo1:/tmp/
scp -r /tmp/%VERSION% repo2:/tmp/
rm -rf /tmp/%VERSION%
</pre>

---+++ On repo1/repo2 (as root)
You can ssh to repo1 and repo2 from jump.grid.iu.edu; you will need to do this procedure on both systems.
<pre class="screen">sudo su -</pre>
<pre class="rootscreen">
mv /tmp/%VERSION% /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/%MAJORVERSION%/
rm -f /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/%MAJORVERSION%/*latest*
/root/mk-sims.sh
ls -l /usr/local/repo/tarball-install/%MAJORVERSION%/*latest* # verify the symlinks are correct
</pre>

---+++ Step 3: Install the tarballs into OASIS

%RED%You must be an OASIS manager of the 'mis' VO to do these steps.%ENDCOLOR%
Known managers as of 2013-08-13: Mat, Tim C, Tim T.
Get the uploader script from SVN and run it with osgrun from the UW AFS install of the tarball client you made earlier.
On a UW CSL machine:
<pre class="screen">svn cat file:///p/vdt/workspace/svn/software/tarball-client/trunk/upload-tarballs-to-oasis &gt; /tmp/upload-tarballs-to-oasis
chmod +x /tmp/upload-tarballs-to-oasis
/p/vdt/workspace/tarball-client/current/sys/osgrun /tmp/upload-tarballs-to-oasis %VERSION%
</pre>
The script will automatically ssh you to oasis-login.opensciencegrid.org and give you instructions to complete the process.

---+++ Step 4: Announce the release

<ol>
<li>The release manager writes the release announcement and send it out. Here is a sample:

<div style="background: #E0F0E0; border: 1px solid gray; padding-right: 2px; padding-left: 2px; padding-top: .5em; padding-bottom: .5em; margin-bottom: 1ex;">
