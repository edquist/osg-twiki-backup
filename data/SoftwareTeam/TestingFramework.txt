---+ OSG Software Testing Framework

Ideas, needs, design, etc.

---++ Requirements

   * What makes our usage different from normal unit testing? Component interconnections are the focus, not tests of isolated functions.
   * Need way to express sequence dependencies (DAG) and state dependencies (e.g., service on/off).
   * Framework should be as minimal as possible and (ideally) unaware of our specific contents.
   * Atomic unit of work is a test.
   * All operations are expressed as tests, including installation, configuration, service start/stop, etc.
   * Tests should express requirements clearly and simply, so that distributed team of developers can work independently and with minimal confusion.
