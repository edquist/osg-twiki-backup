---+ Project 18: Fetch CRL 3 on EL 5 - Technical Details

---++ Work required for OSG Software team (and others?)

---+++ Package Changes

Packages in our SVN that have =fetch-crl= as an explicit dependency:

| *Package* | *Who* | *Status* | *Notes* |
| =cms-xrootd= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | In the contrib repo |
| =dcache-gratia-probe= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | |
| =glite-ce-cream= | blin | In Progress | Never in production, do not release |
| =osg-gridftp= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | Metapackage |
| =osg-gridftp-hdfs= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | Metapackage |
| =osg-gridftp-xrootd= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | Metapackage |
| =osg-se-bestman= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | Metapackage |
| =osg-se-bestman-xrootd= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | Metapackage |
| =osg-se-hadoop= | blin | In Progress | Plus =-gridftp=, =-srm= subpackages; Never in production, do not release |
| =osg-wn-client= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | Metapackage |
| =rsv-metrics= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | See note below |
| =voms-admin-server= | blin | %GREEN%DONE%ENDCOLOR% | |

*Note on rsv-metrics:* =rsv-metrics= says it requires =fetch-crl= but does not run it anywhere, so that dependency can be removed. Looks like it was for an old probe that is no longer used.

RPMs _outside_ of our SVN that have =fetch-crl= as an explicit dependency:

   * =nordugrid-arc-ca-utils= (EPEL)
   
*Note on nordugrid-arc-ca-utils:* We do not use this package, but we should mention it in the announcement anyway. A (hopefully) minor problem with this package is that because we do not ship it, its dependency on =fetch-crl= will not be changed to =fetch-crl3=. Since =fetch-crl3= does not “provide” the =fetch-crl= dependency, the user will have to keep both =fetch-crl= and =fetch-crl3= installed as long as they use =nordugrid-arc-ca-utils= and one of the OSG packages mentioned above.

RPMs that have =/usr/sbin/fetch-crl= as a dependency: none.

---++++ Proposed change

Prior to the change, a spec file that depends on Fetch CRL declares a simple dependency:

<pre>Requires: fetch-crl</pre>

Following the change, each spec file must conditionally depend on the correct Fetch CRL package name:

<pre>%if 0%{?rhel} < 6
Requires: fetch-crl3
%else
Requires: fetch-crl
%endif</pre>

---+++ Software Changes

Some of our software specifically runs the =fetch-crl= executable. These programs must be changed, ideally so that they run =fetch-crl3= if it exists, or =fetch-crl= if it does not. See the =osg-test= code for an example of how to do this carefully. Software to update:

| *What To Change* | *Who* | *Status* | *Notes* |
| =osg-configure= (=osg_configure.modules.utilities.fetch_crl()=) | Suchandra | In progress | |
| =osg-test= (=test_06_fetch_crl.py=) | Tim | %GREEN%Done%ENDCOLOR% | |
| =osg-ca-scripts= (=osg-ca-manage=, =osg-ca-certs-status=; checks if fetch-crl is enabled and when last run) | Tim | In progress | old Perl code |

---+++ Documentation Changes

!TWiki pages to update:

   * Documentation.Release3.InstallBestPractices
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallCertAuth
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallBestmanXrootdSE (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallGratiaService (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallGridFtpXrootd (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallGums
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallHadoopSE
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGBestmanSE (install transcript only)
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallOSGClient
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallRSV
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallVoms
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallWNClient
   * Documentation.Release3.InstallXrootd
   * [[Documentation.Release3.OSGServices]]
   * Documentation.Release3.OsgCaManage
   * <s>Documentation.Release3.RsvPigeonTools</s> (OSG 1.2 only, don't bother)
   * Documentation.Release3.SrmTester
   * Documentation.Release3.UnderstandingComputeElement (note: looks a lot like [[Documentation.Release3.OSGServices]], is one of those two superfluous?)

Pages marked “install transcript only” have transcripts (“screen dumps”) of the output of a full installation procedure.

Pages marked as "included only" have references only in included fragments form other documents

---++ Change Plan / Social Engineering

   1. Need the blessing of Security (%RED%done%ENDCOLOR%), Technology, and Production
   1. Need the upgrade instructions ([[Documentation.UpgradeFetchCrl2to3_draft]]) reviewed and tested
   1. Send a pre-announcement of the change a few weeks in advance; include whether or not this is something to worry about, how much effort migration will take, etc.
   1. Do the release; highlight this change in the release notes and announcement, and link to the upgrade instructions
