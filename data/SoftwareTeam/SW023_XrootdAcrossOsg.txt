---+ Distributing and Caching User Data with !XRootD

Below are whiteboard notes from a brainstorming session about this project. The <a href="%ATTACHURLPATH%/xrootd-stash-whiteboard-20150129.png"/>original whiteboard photo</a> is attached for reference. The meeting was on 29 January 2015 at UCSD and included Frank Wuerthwein, Rob Gardner, Rob Quick, Brian Bockelman, and Tim Cartwright.

90 TB Stash with !XRootD at University of Chicago &rarr; Custodian A

Proxy caches:
   * University of Chicago, UCSD, Indiana University, Boston University
   * (BNL, UNL, UW, SLAC)

Namespace [as agreed upon by all present]:
<pre class="file">/stash/
/osgxd/
/<em>VO-NAME</em>/</pre>
where allowable VO names (<code><em>VO-NAME</em></code>) are according to OIM.

Changes:
   * Add OSG redirector
   * Each cache has some HTCondor information to push info to collector at Indiana University:<br>(OSG Software team will write cron/Python to do this)
      * Total size of cache
      * Amount of data in cache
      * “Heartbeat” [= Timestamp of last report?]
      * Amount of data written today
      * &hellip;
   * HTCondor master runs the !XRootD server
   * Explicit HTCondor group within OSG VO pool
      * Business rule for !ClassAd attribute that declares “I want to use data federation”
   * Use chirp in combination with =stashcp= to put success/failure/performance [information] into !ClassAd
   * Plugin for HTCondor such that files from cache can be used as part of HTCondor file transfer
   * Streamline the setup scripts that establish OSG runtime environment
   * AAA to do a code review of preload library

Brian B. and Tim C. will take care of all of the above changes except for the first one (“Add OSG redirector”)
