---+ Proposal for transitioning to GOC Ticket System

---++ Goal

The OSG Software Team should use a single ticket system for providing user support. This system should allow easy access by other OSG staff so we can share expertise when solving tickets. 

---++ Background

Historically, the OSG Software Team has not had a consistent method for providing support. We've had two systems:

   1. The UW-Madison portion of the team used [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/][RT hosted at the UW-Madison]]. The GOC can assign tickets from their system to RT with ticket interchange software they developed. 
   1. The Fermilab-based Storage Group (which no longer exists as a separate group) used the GOC Ticket System

Problems we have:

   1. Not everyone has accounts on both systems.
   1. Not all tickets can be easily assigned to one of those systems because sometimes they cross boundaries. 
   1. Some tickets should involve other staff in OSG, but it's not easy to bring them in. 
   1. The GOC assigns tickets to one of the systems, but they don't always know which system to assign too.
   1. We no longer have the Storage Group. 

Clearly, we need a solution. Sooner is better.

---++ The Solution 

We should use a single ticket system. We already have a single system that all OSG Staff can already use or easily gain access to: [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open][GOC Ticket]]. This is a custom front-end to Footprints developed by the GOC. No one needs to use Footprints directly. Authorization happens using standard mechanisms (X.509 certificates & OIM). 

It's arguable that there are better ticket systems than GOC Footprints. However, GOC Footprints is already usable by all OSG Staff and is already the ticket system used by OSG Operations. We claim that GOC ticket is good enough to meet our needs and does not require us to implement a new ticket system. 

---++ The Transition

We have existing tickets in RT (at the UW-Madison) that should still continue to work while they are resolved. Therefore we can't simply switch over. We propose the following timeline.
