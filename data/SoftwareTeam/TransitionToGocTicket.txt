---+ Proposal for transitioning to GOC Ticket System

%RED%DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT%ENDCOLOR%

---++ Goal

The OSG Software Team should use a single ticket system for providing user support. This system should allow easy access by other OSG staff so we can share expertise when solving tickets. 

---++ Background

Historically, the OSG Software Team has not had a consistent method for providing support. We've had two systems:

   1. The UW-Madison portion of the team used [[http://crt.cs.wisc.edu/][RT hosted at the UW-Madison]]. The GOC can assign tickets from their system to RT with ticket interchange software they developed. 
   1. The Fermilab-based Storage Group (which no longer exists as a separate group) used the GOC Ticket System

Problems we have:

   1. Not everyone has accounts on both systems.
   1. Not all tickets can be easily assigned to one of those systems because sometimes they cross boundaries. 
   1. Some tickets should involve other staff in OSG, but it's not easy to bring them in. 
   1. The GOC assigns tickets to one of the systems, but they don't always know which system to assign too.
   1. We no longer have the Storage Group. 

Clearly, we need a solution. Sooner is better.

---++ The Solution 

We should use a single ticket system. We already have a single system that all OSG Staff can already use or easily gain access to: [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/goc/open][GOC Ticket]]. This is a custom front-end to Footprints developed by the GOC. No one needs to use Footprints directly. Authorization happens using standard mechanisms (X.509 certificates & OIM). 

It's arguable that there are better ticket systems than GOC Footprints. However, GOC Footprints is already usable by all OSG Staff and is already the ticket system used by OSG Operations. We claim that GOC ticket is good enough to meet our needs and does not require us to implement a new ticket system. 

---++ The Transition

We have existing tickets in RT (at the UW-Madison) that should still continue to work while they are resolved. Therefore we can't simply switch over. We propose the following timeline. 

%RED%<b>Please note:</b>%ENDCOLOR% These dates are proposed, and have not been agreed on by all parties. In fact, the required steps have not been agreed upon. Details here _will_ change.

---++ Managing OSG Software Tickets

(This probably belongs in a separate document, because it's about how we will do support after the transition is complete. It's hear for now to have a single place to talk about things, and it will become a separate document later.)

---+++ Triage duty

All OSG Software Team members who are at least 50% on the software team will share triage duty. Each week (Monday through Friday), there will be one person on triage duty. Incoming tickets will be labeled by the Operations staff as being software tickets. This person will be responsible for triage, which means:

   * Watching the software incoming tickets after they have been labeled by the Operations staff. (i.e. check the queue at least twice a day) You only need to do this during your regular work hours. No weekend or holiday triage is required. The person for triage is responsible for triaging all incoming tickets that haven't be assigned. This includes tickets that arrived over the weekend or were not handled by the previous person on triage duty.
   * Handling incoming tickets where possible. Many tickets are common problems that most team members should be able to solve. For harder tickets, initial details (versions, logs, etc...) can be collected before passing the ticket to someone else. 
   * Assigning incoming tickets to the most appropriate software team member as needed. Where appropriate, include people from other teams (i.e. security, operations, glidein...)
   * Looking at assigned tickets. For tickets that are not being handled in a timely fashion, please reminder the person that owns the ticket. 
   * %RED%What is missing?%ENDCOLOR%

Please note: being on triage duty does _not_ mean that you must personally solve all new tickets. It means that you handle the easy tickets and assign the other tickets appropriately. 

There will be a Twiki page that lists the upcoming triage duty. (If we're clever, we'll make an ical subscription so you can see it in your calendar program. And we'll send a weekly email letting people know they are on duty.)

---+++ Handling tickets

   * We need to take good care of our users. We are in a small community. Please be friendly and patient.
   * The GOC ticket system doesn't clearly show who has responded to a ticket. _Always* sign your ticket with your full name, so people know who is responding.
   * If it's easy for you, include a signature at the bottom of your response. Alain uses: <pre class="file">

OSG Software Support
vdt-support@opensciencegrid.org</pre>
   * If people think we needed it, we'll make a list of "experts" on certain topics.
   * Remember that you can tell people to use the =osg-system-profiler= to collect information. It can shorten the number of times you ask for information because it collects quite a bit for you. 
   * If you run across a problem that has a chance of being hit by other users, consider:
      * Is there a bug we should fix in the software? Or something we could improve in the software?
      * Is there a way to improve our documentation?
      * Can you extend our troubleshooting documents to help people track this down more quickly? Consider the troubleshooting documents to be as much for us as for our users. Also note that as of this writing (January 2012) the troubleshooting documents are not yet deep. We can and should make them deeper.

---+++ Direct email vs. support

If someone emails you directly for support, you have the choice of when to move it to a ticket. The recommended criteria are:

   1. If it's easy to handle and you can definitely do it yourself, leave it in email.
   1. If there is a chance you can't do it in a timely fashion, or a chance that you might lose track of the ticket lose it, or a chance that you might need help from others, turn it into a ticket.
   1. If it's an unusual topic and other people would benefit from seeing the ticket (now or in the future), turn it into a ticket.

---+++ GOC ticket vs. JIRA

GOC Ticket is for user support. This is where we helping users debug, understand their problems, etc.

JIRA is for tracking our work. It's meant for internal usage, not for user support. 

In general, users should not ask for support via JIRA. A single user support ticket might result in zero, one, or multiple JIRA tickets. The user ticket may be closed even though the related JIRA tickets are open. ("Hi, this is a bug that we can't fix for the next six months, but I've made an internal bug report you can se...")

---++ Open Questions

   * Can we have support@opensciencegrid.org as an alias for goc@opensciencegrid.org ? It's a bit more natural of a name.
