---++ Issues

---+++ !jPackage Fire

Or at least, smoke. Here is the heart of Mat’s proposal:

   * The !jPackage !RPMs that we need to build other software with (and only those) will be added to the OSG SVN and upstream cache. They will be put into a separate area of SVN to avoid cluttering up the main repo. I suggest =$SVN/native/javadeps/{trunk,branches}=.
   * We will have an archive of !jPackage !RPMs/SRPMs that we do not use, in case we need to use them later. This archive will be backed up.
   * These RPMs will be built into separate Koji tags, not =el[56]-osg-development=. I suggest =el[56]-osg-javadeps=. I will attempt to make Koji policy to enforce this.
   * The =el[56]-osg-build= tags will inherit from these Koji tags, so we will be able to build using these packages. They will not go into =el[56]-osg-{development,testing,release,contrib}= since we do not want users to download these.

---+++ Regular Issues

   * VOMS: ITB testing
   * CA certificate updater: Testing
   * New Digicert tools release?
   * GUMS: Work on !JARs for next release
