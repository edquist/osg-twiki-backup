---+ Git software development workflow


This document describes the development workflow for OSG software packages kept
in !GitHub. It is intended for people who wish to contribute to OSG software.


---++ Git and !GitHub basics


If you are unfamiliar with Git and !GitHub, the !GitHub website has a good
series of tutorials at https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/


---++ Contribution workflow


We use the standard !GitHub [[https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/][pull request]] workflow for making contributions to OSG software.

If you've never contributed to this project on !GitHub before, do the following
steps first:
   1. Using the !GitHub web interface, <!-- or curl if you're Carl -->fork the repo you wish to contribute to.
   1. Make a clone of your forked repo on your local machine.<pre class="screen">
git clone git@github.com:<em>USERNAME</em>/<em>PROJECT</em></pre>

Once you have your local repo, do the following:
   1. Create a branch to hold changes that are related to the issue you are
      working on. Give the branch a name that will remind you of its purpose,
      such as =sw2345-pathchange=.<pre class="screen">
git checkout -b <em>BRANCH</em></pre>
   1. Make your commits to this branch, then push the branch to your repo on
      !GitHub.<pre class="screen">
git push origin <em>BRANCH</em></pre>
   1. Select your branch in the !GitHub web interface, then create a "pull
      request" against the original repo. Add a good description of your change
      into the message for the pull request. Enter a JIRA ticket number in the
      message to automatically link the pull request to the JIRA ticket.
   1. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a software team member.
      * If the team member accepts your changes, they will merge your pull
        request, and your changes will be incorporated upstream. You may then
        delete the branch you created your pull request from.
      * If your changes are rejected, then you may make additional changes to
        the branch that your pull request is for. Once you push the changes
        from your local repo to your !GitHub repo, they will automatically be
        added to the pull request.


---++ Release workflow

This section is intended for OSG Software team members or the primary
developers of a software project (i.e. those that make releases). Some of the
steps require direct write access the !GitHub repo for the project owned by
=opensciencegrid=. (If you can approve pull requests, you have write access).

<!--
Before you release, you need to make sure your local clone is in sync with the
AFS backup of the !GitHub repo at UW. This requires a UW CS login.

   1. If you haven't already, add the UW repo as a "remote" to your repo:<pre class="screen">
git remote add uw <em>USERNAME</em>@<em>MACHINE</em>:/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/git/repo/<em>PROJECT</em>.git</pre>
      (where <em>USERNAME</em> is your UW CS username (e.g. "matyas"),
      <em>MACHINE</em> is a machine you have access to (e.g.
      "library.cs.wisc.edu"), and <em>PROJECT</em> is the name of the project
      you are releasing (e.g. "osg-configure"))
   1. Fetch changes from the UW repo:<pre class="screen">
git fetch uw</pre>
   1. Compare your branch you are releasing from (probably =master=) to its copy in the UW repo:<pre class="screen">
git checkout master; git diff uw/master</pre>
      There should be no differences.
-->
A release of a software is created from your local clone of a software project.
Before you release, you need to make sure your local clone is in sync with the
!GitHub repo owned by =opensciencegrid= (the OSG repo):

   1. If you haven't already, add the OSG repo as a "remote" to your repo:<pre class="screen">
git remote add upstream git@github.com:opensciencegrid/<em>PROJECT</em></pre>
   1. Fetch changes from the OSG repo:<pre class="screen">
git fetch upstream</pre>
   1. Compare your branch you are releasing from (probably =master=) to its copy in the OSG repo:<pre class="screen">
git checkout master; git diff uw/master</pre>
      There should be no differences.
   1. Once this is done, release the software as you usually do. This process
      varies from one project to another, but often it involves running
      =make upstream= or similar. Check your project's =README= file for
      instructions.
   1. *Test your software.*
   1. Tag the commit that you made the release from. Git release tags are
      conventionally called <code>v<em>VERSION</em></code>, where
      <em>VERSION</em> is the version of the software you are releasing.
      So if you're releasing version 1.3.0, you would create the tag =v1.3.0=.
      %BR%
      <strong>Note:</strong> once a tag has been pushed to the OSG repo, it
      should not be changed. Be sure the commit you want to tag is the final
      one you made the release from.
\
      1. Create the tag in your local repo:<pre class="screen">
git tag <em>TAG</em></pre>
      1. Push the tag to your own !GitHub repo:<pre class="screen">
git push origin <em>TAG</em></pre>
      1. Push the tag to the OSG repo:<pre class="screen">
git push upstream <em>TAG</em></pre>
