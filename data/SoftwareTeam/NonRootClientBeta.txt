---+!! OSG Tarball Clients

%TOC%

---++ Overview

Tarball-based installs for the OSG client and OSG worker node client are now available.
These are for setting up an OSG client either without root privileges or onto an NFS share or nonstandard directory.
They are built from the osg-client and osg-wn-client packages from the 3.1.16 release of the OSG Software Stack.
They are currently in beta state.

For more background, see the [[NonRootClients][non-root clients project page]].

---++ Downloads
Please pick either the osg-client or the osg-wn-client tarball that is appropriate for your distribution and architecture.
The available ones are:

---++ Installation

   1. Unpack the tarball.
   1. Move the directory that was created to where you want the tarball client to be.
   1. Run <code><em>/path/to/client/</em>osg/osg-post-install</code> to fix the directories in the installation.<br/> \
      Note that after this, you will not be able to relocate the install again.
   1. Download and set up CA certificiates using <code>osg-ca-manage</code>
   1. Download !CRLs using fetch-crl (EL6) or fetch-crl3 (EL5)

Example install:

<verbatim class='screen'>
$ mkdir $HOME/test-install
$ cd $HOME/test-install
$ wget http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/tarball-client/osg-client-tb-3.1.16-4-el6.x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar xzf osg-client-tb-3.1.16-4-el6.x86_64.tar.gz
$ cd osg-client
$ osg/osg-post-install
$ . setup.sh
$ osg-ca-manage setupCA --url osg
$ fetch-crl
</verbatim>

---+++ Auto-updating certificates and CRLs

You must create cron jobs to run fetch-crl/fetch-crl3 and osg-update-certs to update your !CRLs and certificates automatically.

Here is what they should look like. (Note: fill in <em>&lt;OSG_LOCATION&gt;</em> with the location of your tarball install).

<pre class='file'>
# Cron job to update certs.
# Runs every hour by default, though does not update certs until they're at
# least 24 hours old.  There is a random sleep time for up to 45 minutes (2700
# seconds) to avoid overloading cert servers.
10 * * * *   ( . <em>&lt;OSG_LOCATION&gt;</em>/setup.sh && osg-update-certs --random-sleep 2700 --called-from-cron )
</pre>

<pre class='file'>
# Cron job to update CRLs for EL5:
# Runs every 6 hours at, 45 minutes +/- 3 minutes.
42 */6 * * *   ( . <em>&lt;OSG_LOCATION&gt;</em>/setup.sh && fetch-crl3 -q -r 360 )
</pre>

<pre class='file'>
# Cron job to update CRLs for EL6:
# Runs every 6 hours at, 45 minutes +/- 3 minutes.
42 */6 * * *   ( . <em>&lt;OSG_LOCATION&gt;</em>/setup.sh && fetch-crl -q -r 360 )
</pre>

You might want to configure proxy settings in $OSG_LOCATION/etc/fetch-crl.conf (EL6) or $OSG_LOCATION/etc/fetch-crl3.conf (EL5)


---++ Usage
A user must set up their environment before running any of the software provided in the client.

There are two way to do this: either source =setup.sh= or =setup.csh= before
running a command, or use the =osgrun= wrapper. All three files are located in
the top-level directory of the client.

*Note:* If =setup.sh=, =setup.csh=, or =osgrun= are missing, then run
=osg/osg-post-install= to (re)create them.

Example usage with =setup.sh=, assuming an install in =$HOME/test-install/osg-client= :

<pre class='screen'>
$ . $HOME/test-install/osg-client/setup.sh
$ grid-proxy-init
$ globus-job-run <em>GATEKEEPER</em> /usr/bin/id
</pre>

(If using =csh= or =tcsh=, source =setup.csh= instead of =setup.sh=)

The user might find it convenient to create a shell alias to =setup.sh= to avoid having to type the full path every session.
For example by adding the following to their =~/.bashrc=:
<pre class='file'>
alias source_setup=". $HOME/test-install/osg-client/setup.sh"
</pre>

Example usage with =osgrun=:

<pre class='screen'>
$ $HOME/test-install/osg-client/osgrun grid-proxy-init
$ $HOME/test-install/osg-client/osgrun globus-job-run <em>GATEKEEPER</em> /usr/bin/id
</pre>

The advantage of =osgrun= is that the environment of the user is left
unchanged, whereas sourcing =setup.sh= or =setup.csh= will modify variables
like =PATH=, =LD_LIBRARY_PATH=, and others, until the user exits from their
shell.

The user might find it useful to set up a shell alias to =osgrun= to avoid having to type the full path every command.
For example by adding the following to their =~/.bashrc=:
<pre class='file'>
alias osgrun="$HOME/test-install/osg-client/osgrun"
</pre>
