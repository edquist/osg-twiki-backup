%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Name* | *Version* | *Development Freeze* | *Package Freeze* | *Release* | *Notes* |
| March | 3.2.21 | 2015-02-23 | 2015-03-02 | 2014-03-10 | |
| April | 3.2.22 | 2015-03-30 | 2015-04-06 | 2015-04-14 | Last possible regular release of 3.1 |
| May | 3.2.23 | 2015-04-27 | 2015-05-04 | 2015-05-12 | 3.2 only&hellip; unless we ship 3.3! |

*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Development Freeze* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.


---++ OSG Software Team

---+++ Discussed
   * %HI%Edgar%IH% IPv6 evaluation of OSG software ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1525][SW-1525]])
      * Are we doing enough to test a component (e.g., !XRootD) before telling the world that it is OK?
      * The actual testing mechanisms (ntop, GUI or not, etc.) are really not that critical as long as they are accurate
      * We should use our own testing recipes, which exist for about 10 components today, most with just 1 test case
      * Also, we should contact each developer, if possible, and ask if IPv6 is supported and/or how to test for it
      * If we generate new test cases in this process, they should be added to the test case repository
   * GFAL exploded this weekend
      * We will try to contact the developer and/or packager to see if the issue is known and has a fix coming
      * Check with ATLAS to see how much they even use GFAL yet
      * Probably need to let at least some sites know not to upgrade yet
   * %HI%Marian%IH% !XRootD 4.1
      * Priorities, in order: support all possible OSG updates seamlessly, make xrootd-4.1 “less special” (ideally passthrough), keep remaining solution as simple as possible
      * Marian has lots of work this week, will do what he can, leave notes in ticket, and transition to !TimC
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Update to Globus Toolkit 6 and !MyProxy 6 in OSG 3.2 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1761][SW-1761]])
      * Builds are done and went very smoothly
      * Will need to rebuild all packages before promotion (still need tool support for mass rebuilds, generally)
      * PBS and SEG is broken

---+++ Updated
   * GIP reporting of HTCondor CE attributes to BDII for ATLAS ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1754][SW-1754]])
   * %HI%Carl%IH% HTCondor security updates ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1774][SW-1774]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1775][SW-1775]], [[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1776][SW-1776]])
   * %HI%BrianL%IH% HTCondor CE
      * Waiting for Horst to schedule OSG 3.2 updates at OU, then to test HTCondor CE with LSF
      * Revising HTCondor CE overview
      * Ongoing: monitoring and supporting HTCondor CE sites, especially LSF and SGE
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Koji OS upgrade ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1442][SW-1442]])
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Fix tarball client creation system for scriptlets ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1769][SW-1769]])
   * %HI%Edgar%IH% RSV perfSONAR probe
   * %HI%Edgar%IH% RSV VO glideinWMS probe
   * %HI%Carl%IH% !PanDA ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1762][SW-1762]]): tested, ran into many hardcoded ATLAS items, sending report to ATLAS developers
   * !StashCache (OSG input data distribution using !XRootD)
   * %HI%TimC%IH% GRAM and !MyProxy transition to TLS-only (due 1 April 2015): Started working on communication plan to sites
   * Other

---+++ In Progress
   * %HI%Mat%IH% EL 7: Working on components for full client and CE (except !BeStMan and GUMS)
   * %HI%Carl%IH% GUMS: Learning more about log4j to address a set of tickets
   * %HI%Jeff%IH% HDFS healing with !XRootD
   * %HI%Carl%IH% Add RSV probe to test batch system submission ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-793][SW-793]])
   * %HI%Jose%IH% OASIS 2: complete draft packaging
   * %HI%TimC%IH% OSG 3.3 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1485][SW-1485]]): Still have a few major points to discuss
   * %HI%TimC%IH% Documentation
      * TODO: Finish 3 prototype documents as exemplars of document types
      * TODO: Continue working on simple documentation tracking mechanism
      * TODO: Continue drafting site installation overview as a draft for organizing home page
   * %HI%BrianL%IH% Automated testing: TODO: Continue designing new test scheduling subsystem (with !TimC, Mat)
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Move OSG software source code (not packaging) to git(hub): discuss plan and timing with !TimC
   * UW ITB site: build machines with Puppet! (all)
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Offsite backups: add some monitoring?
   * %HI%Edgar%IH% !HTCondor CE and PBS: setting up about 700 cores with PBS and an !HTCondor CE front-end
   * %HI%Mat%IH% Checking local backups with Nagios: waiting for help from Aaron
   * Support

---+++ Upcoming
   * Koji software upgrade: harder than OS upgrade due to database schema migration

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * (Finally!) Got a successful “at scale” test of the new OASIS S1 blanking scripts. This allowed the new oasis-config to get into this week’s release.
      * Near Future: significant overhaul of oasis-config to allow for automated distribution so new default configs are not tied to the release cycle.
   * Working with USCMS, starting to get serious about next HTCondor CE steps: turn off GRAM and talk to T3s about transition plans.
      * We’ve asked all USCMS Tier-2s to turn off GRAM to save effort on debugging.
   * Another meeting with CERN IT, planning on how to get CMS off the BDII for HTCondor CE sites.
   * Started work on the foundations of the Xrootd caching service.  Concretely, started work to make sure Xrootd server can be managed by the condor_master (which will allow for remote restarts and eventually automated config updates).
   * Upcoming next week: Figure out CHEP paper and attendance plans.
   * Upcoming next week: Deploy new S-0 and login server at GOC ITB.
