You will need:

   1. An account on a UW-Madison CS machine with AFS access (for example library.cs.wisc.edu)
   1. An account on the new batlab submit machine (submit-01.batlab.org)
   1. An account on the new batlab mock build machine (mock-1.batlab.org) (2 and 3 are different accounts for the moment, in the future we hope to combine them).
   1. SSH host keys set up so that you can ssh to the CSL machine from submit-01 without typing a password.
   1. An SVN checkout of software/vdt-build/trunk to run vdt-build from.

---++ 1-3. An account on a UW-Madison CS machine with AFS access
Talk to one of the UW VDT team members.
UW VDT team members: For 1, they should email the CSL (lab@cs.wisc.edu) to request an account. For 2 and 3, they should email condor-inf@cs.wisc.edu.

---++ 4. SSH host keys (assuming your UW CS machine is library.cs.wisc.edu)
<pre>
ssh submit-01.batlab.org
ssh-keygen -t dsa
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_dsa
scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub library.cs.wisc.edu:
ssh library.cs.wisc.edu
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
cat id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm -f id_dsa.pub
</pre>

If everything works, you should be able to ssh from submit-01.batlab.org to library.cs.wisc.edu without typing a password.

---++ 5. SVN checkouts on your CS machine (assuming library.cs.wisc.edu)
<pre>
svn checkout https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/vdt-build/trunk vdt-build
svn checkout https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/native/redhat/trunk redhat
</pre>

You can run vdt-build directly from your svn checkout. For example, to rebuild vdt-release:
<pre>vdt-build/vdt-build batlab redhat/vdt-release --yum-base /p/vdt/public/html/repos/3.0/el5/development</pre>
If you don't want to pass --yum-base every time, copy =vdt-build/sample-vdt-build.ini= to =$HOME/.vdt-build.ini=
