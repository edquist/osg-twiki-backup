---+ OSG Software Component: OSG Display

---++ Purpose

The OSG Display software generates usage reports for the number of jobs, cpu hours, and transfers on the Open Science Grid, and is displayed on http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Usage

See http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Source

The OSG's packaging of osg-display-data (previously named OSG_Display_Data) is based on the upstream source from the VDT Software repo under https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/osg-display-data/ (migrated from its original home at svn://t2.unl.edu/brian/osg_display).

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

The original software was written by Brian Bockelman, and then later maintained by Ashu Guru. Soichi Hayashi was apparently involved at some point with maintaining this also.

In December 2013, Carl Edquist worked with Brian Bockelman to migrate the source from UNL to UW SVN, where it currently lives for future maintenance work.
