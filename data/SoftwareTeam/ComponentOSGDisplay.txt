---+ OSG Software Component: OSG Display

---++ Purpose

The OSG Display software generates usage reports for the number of jobs, cpu hours, and transfers on the Open Science Grid, and is displayed on http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Usage

See http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Source

The OSG's packaging of osg-display-data (previously named OSG_Display_Data) is based on the upstream source from svn://t2.unl.edu/brian/osg_display .  We may consider making the VDT svn repo the official home at some point for future maintenance work.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

The original software was written by Brian Bockelman, and then later maintained by Ashu Guru.   Soichi Hayashi was apparently involved at some point with maintaining this also.  Future ownership of the software is yet to be discussed, but it will most likely be taken over by someone on the OSG Software Team.
