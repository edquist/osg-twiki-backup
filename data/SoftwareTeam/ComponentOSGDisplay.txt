---+ OSG Software Component: OSG Display

---++ Purpose

The OSG Display software generates usage reports for the number of jobs, cpu hours, and transfers on the Open Science Grid, and is displayed on http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Usage

See http://display.grid.iu.edu/

---++ Source

The OSG's packaging of osg-display-data (previously named OSG_Display_Data) is based on the upstream source from svn://t2.unl.edu/brian/osg_display .  We may consider making the VDT svn repo the official home at some point for future maintenance work.

---++ Packaging

*Repository:* OSG.

---++ History

The original software was written by Brian Bockelman, and then later maintained by Ashu Guru. Soichi Hayashi was apparently involved at some point with maintaining this also.
