---+ Running Tests as VM Jobs

This page is my (cat) collected notes and ideas about running osg-test runs as VM jobs, either locally (e.g., CHTC) or in OSG.


---++ HTCondor VM Universe

For HTCondor 8.0, the documentation for VM universe is in [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.0/2_11Virtual_Machine.html][section 2.11]] of [[http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/v8.0/ the manual]].

Some quick notes:

   * =universe = vm=
   * =executable= is just a label
   * Omit =input=, =output=, and =error=, as they are not used and will cause submit failures
   * Must select a =vm_type= of =vmware=, =xen=, or =kvm=


---++ Creating VM Images

   * John Hover has used [[http://boxgrinder.org BoxGrinder]] to do his virtualization work. It has not received an update since mid-2012, but may be sufficient.
   * A newer project is [[http://imgfac.org imagefactory]], although it is unclear whether it support the simple case of creating an image to be deployed without a commercial cloud.
