---+ Plan for Handling CA Certificates in RPMs

---++ Existing work

   * We have agreed that we want both osg-ca-certs RPM and vdt-ca-manage packaged as a separate RPM.
   * GOC currently hosts osg-ca-certs, v1.19 (about to be 1.20) in a stand-alone repository.
   * OSG Software has created osg-ca-certs and placed it in its repository
      * Unfortunately, this is *not* the same as the GOC one, as the packager didn't have access to their SRPM.  They versioned as version "3", and made it a meta-RPM that pulls in vdt-ca-certs
   * vdt-ca-manage has not been packaged into an RPM.

---++ Requirements / Issues

   * We need to unwind the versioning mistake made in the OSG Software osg-ca-certs. (This can be done with epoch or just blocking the old RPM.)
   * We should have one RPM for osg-ca-certs, one RPM for IGTF-only certs, and one RPM for vdt-ca-manage
      * All RPMs should have a virtual provides of "grid-certificates".  Hence, any package that needs certificates will add "Requires: grid-certificates", not a specific method.
      * It should not be possible to install vdt-ca-manage and one of the CA certificates
   * We need a short documentation page explaining how to install and manage certificates.  This will be included into other install documents *prior* to the first "yum install" call to make sure the admin knows what they are getting.
   * OSG Security must be able to control the contents of the CA certificates in the repository.
