---++ Packaging

---++ History

Originally packaged by Lincoln Bryant at University of Chicago, we expanded on his initial work and separated the package into multiple sub-packages. The main package, =cctools=, only included the docs so according to standard packaging conventions we separated them out into =cctools-doc= package and no longer build a binary rpm for =cctools=

---++ Future

We should think about making =cctools= a metapackage that requires =cctools-doc= and potentially other sub-packages.
