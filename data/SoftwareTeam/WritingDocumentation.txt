---+ Tips for Writing Software Documentation

---++ Writing Procedural (Step-by-Step) Instructions

   * <p>Title the procedure with the user goal, usually starting with a gerund; e.g.:</p>\
      <p><strong>Installing the Frobnosticator</strong></p>
   * <p>Number all steps (as opposed to using bullets)</p>
   * <p>List steps in order in which they are performed</p>
   * <p>Each step should begin with a single-line instruction in plain English, in command form; e.g.:</p>\
      <p>3. Make sure that the Frobnosticator configuration file is world-writable</p>
   * <p>If the means of carrying out the instruction is unclear or complex, include clarification, ideally in the form of a working example; e.g.:</p>\
      <pre class="command">chmod a+x /usr/share/frobnosticator/frob.conf</pre>
   * <p>Put clarifying information in separate paragraphs within the step</p>
   * <p>Put critical information about the *whole* procedure in one or more paragraphs before the numbered steps</p>
   * <p>Put supplemental information about the *whole* procedure in one or more paragraphs after the numbered steps</p>
   * <p>Avoid pronouns when writing technical articles or documentation e.g., =install foo= rather than =install it=.</p>
