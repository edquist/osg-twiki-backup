---+ Switching Software Area (/software) to Git

---++ Objectives

   * The authoritative repositories must be hosted at Madison
   * We must have regular backups of the repositories
   * There must be a public mirror of our repository (!GitHub) and it must be kept up-to-date
   * Only authorized people (team members) can commit to the authoritative repos
   * Anyone should be able to submit a contribution
   * Team members must be able to quickly and easily add a contribution to the repo
   * The workflows for both contributors and team members must be clearly documented and robust
   * History must not be lost

---++ Architecture

---+++ Location of/Access to the Authoritative Repos (Options)

---++++ AFS (Matyas's preference)
Keep the repos on the UW's AFS. We'll use the UW CSL's kerberos authentication. External collaborators will ssh to e.g. =library.cs.wisc.edu= to push.
---+++++ Advantages
   * Existing team members already have access
   * No daemons to set up (except for a web interface)
   * Volumes will be backed up as-is
   * Precedent: HTCondor team does this
   * Not dependent on a single machine (any machine with AFS access is good)
---+++++ Disadvantages
   * Decent access control will require creation of new AFS groups, which are a pain to manage
   * Or we could make everything owned by =condor:vdt= like we do for the SVN repos. Then we won't have any fine-grained access control though
   * Need to ensure backup/mirroring cronjobs have AFS tokens
   * Might be slow
   * Some management (e.g. setting up the web interface) needs to go through the CSL

---++++ Local Drive on CSL Server
Same access method as with AFS, but the actual files will be kept in /scratch (and backed up to AFS, of course).
---+++++ Advantages
   * No daemons to set up (except for a web interface)
---+++++ Disadvantages
   * Existing team members will need access to the specific machine the repo is on
   * No fine-grained access control; we don't control Unix groups so we can't make any of those
   * Dependent on a single machine
   * Better hope our backups are good because the CSL won't be making any
   * Some management (e.g. setting up the web interface) needs to go through the CSL

---++++ CHTC-controlled Git server (git.chtc.wisc.edu)
Access via Gitolite. Users will need to use public keys and SSH.
---+++++ Advantages
   * Already set up, just need to add new repositories and public keys
   * Fine-grained access control
   * Precedent: CHTC infrastructure team does this
   * Web interface also already set up
---+++++ Disadvantages
   * OSG team has no login access to that machine
   * Dependent on CHTC infrastructure for all management (including setting up backups, cronjobs, etc.)
   * Dependent on a single machine
   * Shared resource with other CHTC members

---++++ OSG-controlled Git server (perhaps on osghost.chtc.wisc.edu?)
Access via Gitolite. Users will need to use public keys and SSH.
---+++++ Advantages
   * Full control over software, users, cronjobs, daemons, backups, everything
   * Fine-grained access control
---+++++ Disadvantages
   * Full responsibility for software, users, cronjobs, daemons, backups, everything
   * Dependent on a single machine
   * Nothing set up

---+++ Public (!GitHub) Mirror

We will create one !GitHub repo for each authoritative repo. The !GitHub repos
will be owned by the "opensciencegrid" organization. Team members will
need to have !GitHub accounts and be members of the organization.

We will have a dedicated !GitHub account for doing automated pushes to !GitHub.
We'll have a cron job that mirrors periodically, as well as a "post-receive"
hook for each repo that does a push to !GitHub after every push it receives.

---+++ Backups

Regardless of the other parts of the architecture, a rolling backup system like what we do for the SVN repos would be a good idea.
Here's a simple outline. For each repository:
   1. Lock the repo (probably via an "update" hook that does exit 1)
   1. Wait for git-receive-pack processes to exit
   1. Rsync to copy the repo (preferably to AFS)
   1. Unlock the repo (remove the hook)
   1. Delete the oldest backups until we have &lt;=10

---++ Contributions

People can fork or clone our !GitHub mirror and send pull requests. A team
member can examine the pull request, download it as a patch, then apply it to
their own repo, and push the commit(s) to the real repos.

Shouldn't take too long -- !GitHub provides copy-and-paste instructions, though
they will have to be slightly modified since they are providing instructions on
how to apply the change to the !GitHub repo, not your own.

---++ Migration

---+++ One-time Setup

   1. Set up a git server
   1. Create an authors file to map SVN user names to email addresses for Git (there is one at "/p/condor/workspaces/vdt/svn-access/authors.txt")
   1. Create a backup cronjob that reads a list of repositories to back up; should be run by cndrutil user if we care about AFS
   1. Create a !GitHub user that will be used for auto uploads; create a passwordless ssh key for it and store it somewhere safe; also store the !GitHub password for the user somewhere safe
   1. Create a mirror cronjob that reads a list of repositories and mirrors them all to github using the user from the previous step

---+++ Per-project Migration

   1. Schedule a switchover date with the owner
   1. Use subgit import to convert the repository (it's a lot nicer than git-svn)
   1. Add info about the repo to the gitolite config file (if using gitolite)
   1. Set up git hooks (copy them from another converted repository, or we may have a template)
   1. Update the backup cronjob
   1. Test the repo
      1. Test viewing via web interface
      1. Test making changes (you should test this, and then the owner should as well)
         1. Clone the repo
         1. Make a branch
         1. Make a change, commit it to the branch
         1. Push the branch
   1. Make a file in the trunk of the SVN dir called =MOVED-TO-GIT= that contains the following text:<pre>
The source code for this project is now contained in a Git repository located at:
<b>repo url</b>
Changes committed to SVN will be ignored.</pre>
   1. svn lock the project in SVN

---+++ Per-Project Mirroring to !GitHub

   1. Create an opensciencegrid/<em>PROJECT</em> github repo
   1. In the local (authoritative) git repo, do <code>git remote add --mirror github git@github.com:opensciencegrid/<em>PROJECT</em>.git</code>
   1. Add the repo to the list of repositories managed by the mirror cronjob
   1. Add a "post-receive" hook to the local repo to push to github -- might be as simple as <pre>
exec git push --quiet github &
</pre>

---+++ Notes

We will need to rewrite any hooks we have (the post-commit email for example).

We will not have information on full project renames (since each project dir will become a separate repo).

We need to keep the old SVN repo around to get the full history.

We may wish to omit dead projects or old names of renamed projects (vdt-build for example).




---+ Switching RPM area (/native/redhat) to Git (on hold)

---++ Additional Objectives
In addition to objectives listed in the software area migration topic,
these are also necessary:

   * Trusted contributors (people with Koji accounts) should be able to make scratch builds from non-authoritative repos
   * Only team members should be able to make non-scratch builds
   * Non-scratch builds should only be made from authoritative repos
   * Existing repo branch / tag safeguards (e.g. builds from =hcc= repo only accepted into the =hcc*= tags) must continue to function

---++ Architecture
Same architecture as the software area.

---++ Usage

---+++ Contributions
Same method as the software area.

---+++ Scratch Builds by Anyone From Anywhere

*TODO* Need to research how this is possible. We may not be able to enforce this
at the Koji level, but might have to do it in osg-build.

---+++ Non-Scratch Builds by Team Members Only From Authoritative Repos

This is how things currently are. We would need to make no changes other than
changing the repo URLs in the Koji configs. *TODO* Research if it is possible
to keep this restriction while still removing the scratch build restriction.

---+++ Repo / Tag Safeguards

Requires changes to osg-build. We can't completely lock things down, as all
osg-build safeguards can be bypassed by using Koji commands directly.

---+++ Documentation

We will need separate documentation for team members (read: people who
can merge pull requests), and for other contributors. We should have
information about branch layout, best practices, common workflows, etc.
Docs on how to submit builds might need to be updated.

---++ Migration

---+++ Difficulties

Our SVN repo contains many different projects, and generally each one has its
own set of =trunk/=, =branches/=, =tags/= directories. We can do this in SVN
because a branch or a tag is just another directory, and merges can happen
between any two directories.

In Git, such a structure is impossible. Branches and tags are global to the
entire repository and merges happen between branches, not between directories.
Therefore, the only way to migrate our SVN repo is to split it up into multiple
repos, one per project.

We should to create an =authors= file that maps the authors of SVN commits to
real names and email addresses.

We will need to rewrite any hooks that we have (such as the post-commit email).

We need to evaluate how well the conversion tools keep track of renames,
especially when an entire project gets renamed.

We will *not* remove the old SVN repo after conversion, but keep them for
historical reasons. We may disable commits to it, though. This also allows us
to skip migrating subtrees which are no longer in use.

---+++ Directories to Migrate

---++++ Software Area (/software/*)

The majority of projects here already have the standard SVN layout. Those that
don't have a single directory that corresponds to trunk. Git easily handles
either case.

---++++ /access, /pacman, /rsv.donotuse, /osg-edu, /sandbox, /utils


These will not be migrated. /access and /utils are empty. /pacman and
/rsv.donotuse may have historical value, but will not get new updates. /sandbox
is unnecessary: people have their own repos they can play around with.

---++++ /certs, /ligo, /nees-ft, /teragrid, /tests, /vdt

These are old projects and have not been committed to in years. We will evaluate
whether to migrate, not migrate, or defer migration to a later date.

---++++ /new-test

Has a standard SVN layout and will be its own repo.

---++++ /native

This directory has its own set of challenges. See "Migrating the Native Area"
below.

---+++ Available Software for Migration

---++++ git-svn

Part of the git suite. git-svn allows bidirectional communication between Git
and SVN, i.e. you can use git-svn to create a git repo from a subtree of an SVN
repo, make your changes in the git repo, and then push the changes back to SVN.
Some developers (Matyas Selmeci, Brian Lin) already do this.

The method, if we were to use this, would be to use git-svn to make Git repos
for each SVN subtree we want to convert, clone and commit to those repos and
_not_ push the commits back to SVN.

*Advantages:*
   * Package available in RHEL repositories, and also available in the CSL
   * Bidirectional support allows people to try it out before switching over
   * Lots of instructions on-line
   * This is more or less the way everyone does it

*Disadvantages:*
   * Apparently does not keep merge history
   * May be slow

---++++ !SubGit

A commercial software product specifically written to solve the limitations of
git-svn. Also bidirectional, but can do one-time imports as well. Free to
evaluate, has special licensing for Open Source projects. Matyas has used it
(albeit to do the reverse, convert from Git to SVN), and considers it very easy
to use.

The method, if we were to use this, would be to use their =subgit import=
command once per subtree. (This is their one-way conversion command).

*Advantages:*
   * Does everything git-svn does, but better

*Disadvantages:*
   * Not available everywhere -- Java app (though Matyas has been able to install it onto his CSL desktop)
   * Proprietary — may cost money and/or require proof of open-sourceness; however, there is an evaluation (nagware) version available, and if all we're doing is a one-time conversion, we could just install it, run it once, then uninstall it

---++ Migrating the Native Area

---+++ Background

The /native/redhat subtree of SVN is where we keep all of our packages and is
currently the most active subtree. Getting the migration and the layout of this
area right is therefore extremely important.

---+++ Problems

While on the surface, this subtree appears to have the standard SVN layout
(trunk, branches, tags), several of the "branches" here are used very
differently than in normal software projects.

In a normal software project, the contents of two branches are very similar --
they usually have the same set of files, plus or minus a few. This is true for
/native/redhat/trunk and /native/redhat/branches/osg-3.1, but *not* true for any
of our other branches.

For example, the upcoming branch contains only a handful of packages, each
package either specifically created in the upcoming directory, or copied over
from trunk. We completely empty the upcoming branch whenever we release a new
major version (after merging the changes into trunk).

The osg-internal branch contains a few packages that are used only for building,
and will *never* be merged into trunk. This is not at all how a branch in a
normal software project is used.

The advantage we have here is a mostly consistent mapping of packages in SVN and
packages in Koji tags.

Another advantage we get with SVN is the ability to do partial merges -- that
is, merge only a single directory. Git cannot merge between directories, only
between branches. While we encourage developers to make one commit per
directory, if case they do not, then it will take effort to split up their
commits.

---+++ Possible Layouts

---++++ 1. Normal project

In this layout, we treat the entire /native/redhat area as a normal
software project.  osg-3.1 will be a branch, as will upcoming. This is a
simple, obvious conversion to do. The problem will come with the
mostly-empty repos like upcoming. You won't be able to get an easy
overview of what is and what isn't in upcoming by doing an ls. At best
you can get a look at what has changed by doing 'git diff master'. We
lose the 1-1 correspondence.

---++++ 2. Separate repos for separate tags

In this layout, we put /native/redhat/trunk and /native/redhat/branches/osg-3.1
in one repo, and we make separate repos for upcoming, osg-internal, and the
other.

We mostly keep the 1-1 mapping. The tricky bit is merging from upcoming to main.
We could either use git format-patch/git am, or just copy files. Either way,
merging is going to be a pain and history won't be as complete. *TODO*
elaborate on this

---++++ 3. One repo per package

This may sound excessive, but it is the approach that Fedora takes. Each
package lives in its own repo that has its own set of branches that we
must keep synchronized. We would have to build a lot of tooling around
this to keep the branches consistent (make sure that the repo for each
package that's supposed to be in upcoming has an upcoming branch, for
example). This lets us make individual checkouts of packages. It also
makes merges from upcoming to trunk, etc., easy because that is the way
Git is designed to work.

The downside is that it's more to maintain, and it's hard at a glance to
do things across all packages in a tag (for example, touch everything in
upcoming).

*TODO* would we have to make one !GitHub repo per package? Is that
allowed? Can we automate it? I notice that Fedora doesn't have a !GitHub
mirror, maybe that's why...

---++++ 4. Keep native/redhat as an SVN repo, make a !GitHub mirror of that

*TODO* Derek Weitzel (I think) already set something like that up at one
point. See if it's still up, and how he synchronizes it.

---++++ 5. Keep most of native/redhat as an SVN repo, but turn the contrib branch into its own Git repo
