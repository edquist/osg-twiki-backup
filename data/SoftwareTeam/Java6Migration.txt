---+ Project 19: Migrate from Oracle JDK 6

---++ Description

---+++ Background

Currently, several of our packages are Java-based, and we build them against the Oracle JDK 6. Oracle is officially discontinuing public support for Java 6 at the end of February 2013, including security fixes. This is a problem for us due to the numerous security flaws in Java that people keep discovering. Therefore we must move away from Oracle JDK 6.

---+++ Goal and Scope

Migrate all active Java-based software components in OSG Software to the !OpenJDK 7 implementation of Java 7 for both build and runtime environments.

The scope of this project is necessarily broad, given the security implications of staying with Java 6. Not only will we rebuild nearly all Java-based packages that we include in OSG Software 3.1 and conduct functional integration tests on them, but also we will try to fix problems that we find with the software or builds. If we create software patches, we will submit them upstream as possible. If we cannot fix broken software, we will strive to work closely with the upstream developers to get the issues resolved quickly and to keep OSG management informed of roadblocks.

By default, the scope of this project does not include rebuilding or fixing of software packages that we do not include in OSG Software 3.1 but that our software depends on. However, if we must update external software packages to make our packages work, then we will copy the currently external ones into our system and make patches as needed. We consider this approach to be a last resort.

Also, the scope of this project does not include OSG Software 1.2 (Pacman) at all. Rebuilding and updating the Java packages therein would be very time consuming, and the End-Of-Life date for OSG Software 1.2 is approaching rapidly (mid-May, 2013).

---++ Tasks

The main tasks of the project are:

   * Identify all OSG Software 3.1 packages that depend on Java
   * Rebuild all Java packages against !OpenJDK 7
   * Test all rebuilt packages at the unit test level (if available) and at the functional integration level, manually and with our automated test suite
   * Coordinate ITB testing of beta-quality packages
   * As needed, patch software to build and/or function correctly
   * Promote all Java packages through the Upcoming repository series, ultimately up to Upcoming-production
   * Coordinate production testing of packages Upcoming-production
   * Promote final packages through the standard repository series, ultimately to production
   * Communicate the change process and known issues to the OSG community, especially site administrators
   * Report software bugs and submit patches upstream to external software developers
