---+ Project 19: Migrate from Oracle JDK 6

---++ Description

---+++ Background

Currently, several of our packages are Java-based, and we build them against the Oracle JDK 6. Oracle is officially discontinuing public support for Java 6 at the end of February 2013, including security fixes. This is a problem for us due to the numerous security flaws in Java that people keep discovering. Therefore we must move away from Oracle JDK 6.

---+++ Goal (and Scope)

Migrate all active Java-based software components in OSG Software to the !OpenJDK 7 implementation of Java 7 for both build and runtime environments.
