---+ Procedure for updating empty-* packages
---++ Background
The =empty-*= packages were introduced in EmptyPackageFixProposal as a workaround
for sites that install certain software (for example HTCondor or CA certs) from
tarballs or other means that do not involve Yum/RPM.

The packages contain no files, and exist merely to satisfy RPM dependencies so
that other packages can be installed. It is the admin's responsibility to make
sure that whatever component they installed the empty package for is
functional.


The empty packages are kept in a separate repository to prevent them from being
accidentally installed instead of the component they claim to provide. Because
of this, they do not go through the normal release process of development
&rarr; testing &rarr; prerelease &rarr; release, but are _moved_ straight from
=osg-development= into =osg-empty= after developer testing. It is important
that the packages do not stay in =osg-development= for only as long as
necessary to do developer testing.

---++ Procedure
   1. Coordinate with the Software and Release Managers to set aside a good
      time to update the package. An empty package should not remain in the
      development repos for longer than a few hours.
   1. Update the package as normal and build into development.
   1. Test out of development. _Be thorough_, as there is no separate acceptance
      testing for empty packages.
   1. In the JIRA ticket, document your testing procedure and request
      permission from _both_ the Software and the Release Managers.  (Since
      there is no acceptance testing, both of them have to sign off on the new
      build).
   1. After receiving permission, tag the builds into the =osg-empty= tags, and
      untag them from the =osg-development= tags. Then regenerate the
      =osg-empty= repos.
