*Notes:* Additional “urgent” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Discussions

*VDT website.* We (in Madison) are making some changes to ACLs in the vdt.cs.wisc.edu web area. They should not affect any use cases (that we care about), but if you notice any new issues, please let us know right away. Mostly, no one uses the old VDT website anyway.

*GRAM/PBS failures.* Any progress here?

*Repo consolidation.* There is [[SW024_ConsolidateRepos][a new little project]] to consolidate all of our public software repositories to repo.grid.iu.edu, thereby allowing the GOC to decommission software.grid.iu.edu. At the moment, it seems that this change will affect only certain CA certificate use cases and any software that depends on the old host.

*EL&nbsp;7 support.*

*EL&nbsp;7 on !FermiCloud.* Wrote Steve Timm, “We are dependent on the Scientific Linux team blessing Scientific Linux 7 for official use at Fermilab and official confirmation that it conforms to the Fermilab baseline.” In the meantime, contact Mat for help on how to do EL&nbsp;7 testing.

---+++ Major Activities
   * Support EL 7 ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1541][SW-1541]])
   * Fix routine automated test failures ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1996][SW-1996]])
   * Documentation
   * !StashCache ([[https://jira.opensciencegrid.org/browse/SOFTWARE-1815][SW-1815]])

---++ OSG Investigations Team

   * OASIS:
      * (old) New version goes out to ITB tomorrow (primary feature: ability to replicate any repository and still follow OSG-Security constraints).  Assuming successful production deploy, we will need to do a new client config RPM in November.
   * StashCache:
      * StashCache tester continues to gather good performance data at https://stashcache.github.io/
      * Prototype of CVMFS-over-StashCache continues to make progress.  CVMFS team is reviewing the pull requests.  All parts are now functional.
      * Making progress in puppetizing GOC configuration.  DNS alias still giving problems with XRootD rediretor.
   * CEMon (part of HTCondor-CE): 
      * Got first round of requests for improvements from AGIS.  Ball is in our court now, on going.
   * OSG-CE-BOSCO: No progress to report
