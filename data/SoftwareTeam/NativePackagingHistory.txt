---+ Native Packaging History

%RED%DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT%ENDCOLOR%

This document is being written in April of 2011. It is meant to provide input from the VDT team to Dan Fraser's root cause analysis of native packaging. 

---++ 1.0 Background

---+++ 1.1 Coherency principle
A principle we had from the beginning, and for a long time was:

<blockquote>
Principle: Maintain coherency between the Pacman and native package versions of the VDT. Share as much as possible. 
</blockquote>

This was not an optimization against saving time for future work, but was an effort to leverage our existing work. It lead to at least three decisions:
   * Create binary RPMs out of the build process that we use for Pacman packages. These were conversions of the tarballs we were already creating.
   * Improve our configuration system such that we can share configuration scripts between Pacman and RPM installations. 
   * Attempt to keep the organization of packages such that we have (or nearly have) a one-to-one correspondance of Pacman packages and RPMs. 

In retrospect, we do not think this was the right principle to adopt.

---+++ 1.2 Community

When we began this work, we did not have a good understanding of the existing communities, how they thought about packaging, and what they expected from packaging.

---++ 2.0 Timelines

(All dates should be presumed to be wrong--these sections barely deserve to be called drafts but will be updated soon.)

---+++ 2.1 LIGO packaging timeline

May/June 2009? LIGO request for GT 4.2

July/August 2009? Started?

Make sure to include ramp-up time. Meeting with Miron suggesting we don't keep in sync with Pacman/OSG for LIGO?

Early 2010? GT 4.2 release

Request for GT 5.0?

Various updates we did?

---+++ 2.2 Non-LIGO packaging timeline

Early 2010? Discussion about improved configuration scheme, with eye on keeping it compatible between Pacman and RPM. Involved Suchandra

May 2010? Blueprint at BNL re: configuration & native packaging

Fall 2010: Native packaging, Mat's infrastructure for binary RPMs, Tim's configuration prototype. Glexec mongo RPM. Note that glexec came before worker nodes.

February 2011: Clarified worker node RPMs
March 2011: Worker node RPMs

---+++ 2.3 Other interesting dates

June/July 2009: Tim's class

July 27, 2009 (verified): Mat's start date

March-July 2010: OSG Summer School

July 2010: Tim's class
