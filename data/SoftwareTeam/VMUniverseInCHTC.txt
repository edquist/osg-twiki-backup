---+ How to Run a VM Universe Job in CHTC

---++ Overview

This document describes how to prepare and run a job using HTCondor’s VM universe and CHTC’s pre-made VM images.

---++ CHTC Base Operating System VM Images

CHTC provides VM images with basic operating system installations. Each provides the following semantics, regardless of implementation details:

   * The operating system is up-to-date (within 7 calendar days)
   * The system supports installation of other packages from the operating system repositories (nb. RHN)
   * The operating system boots normally into an appropriate runlevel to run a user-supplied payload
   * The system is on a network with outbound access for reasonable, safe Internet activities, including:
      * Fetching and sending files via http, https, ftp, gsiftp
      * Synchronizing the system clock with NTP
   * Inbound network access to the virtual guest is severely limited (only ssh from hypervisor)
   * The system clock is accurately set with date, time, and local time zone (US Central)
   * There is at least 2GB of free disk space under / on the filesystem
   * SELinux is disabled
   * Following a successful boot, the system runs a user-supplied payload:
      * First, it attempts to mount =/dev/vdb= (ext2) at =/mnt/user=
      * If successful, it executes =/mnt/user/run-job= as root
      * The job environment for =run-job= is stripped down to just:<pre class="file">PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin
USER=root
PWD=/
LANG=en_US.UTF-8</pre>
      * All standard output and error from run-job is logged to =/mnt/user/run-job.log=
      * If the mount is successful, but the script cannot be run, informative error messages are logged to =/mnt/user/run-job-failure.log=

---++ Prepare a Job Payload

   1. Prepare your job to run in batch mode, as with any HTCondor job
      * All input files that you provide will be contained in the =/mnt/user/input= directory on the virtual machine
      * All output should be written to the =/mnt/user/output= directory on the virtual machine — all other output files will be lost!
   1. Select one (or more) base OS images to run your job payload; currently we have Tim’s SL 6.4 and !CentOS 6.4 images
   1. Prepare an executable, named =run-job=, that prepares the run-time environment of your job and runs it

The latter step is the hard part! The =run-job= executable is responsible for preparing a bare-bones OS install to run your actual job and thus may need to include steps such as:

   * Installing software packages that your job needs; these may come from the OS repositories or other repositories that you set up
   * Configuring the system or other software packages
   * Setting up environment variables
   * Downloading and/or preparing input files, directory structures, etc.

Further, the set-up steps may depend on the particular base OS image that you selected.

---++ Prepare an Input-Output Image

After writing the run-job script and collecting all input files, you package all of them into a small disk image that will serve as both input and output partition for the job.

---+++ One-Time Setup Tasks

Creating the image requires extra software on the machine with run-job and the input files. Install the following packages (RPM names verified on el6):

   * libguestfs-tools

After installing, verify that you have a command named =virt-make-fs=.

---+++ Making the Image

   1. Create a new directory:<pre class="screen">mkdir image</pre>
   1. Create input and output subdirectories:<pre class="screen">mkdir image/input; mkdir image/output</pre>
   1. Copy your =run-job= executable into the image directory:<pre class="screen">cp run-job image/</pre>
   1. Make sure that =run-job= is executable:<pre class="screen">chmod 0755 image/run-job</pre>
   1. Copy all input files for your job (=run-job= and the real job) into the input directory; e.g.:<pre class="screen">cp input-file-1 image/input/</pre>
   1. Make the image file from the image directory:<pre class="screen">virt-make-fs --size=<em>1M</em> input <em>my-vm-image.raw</em></pre>

In the last step, it is possible to customize the size of the image by changing the value of the =--size== option; the format is a number (decimal is fine) followed immediately by b/K/M/G/T/P/E to mean bytes, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes, Petabytes or Exabytes. The image size must be big enough to contain run-job, all of your input files, and all of your job’s output files. It is best to leave a little extra room, about 5–10% extra, but not too much extra because this file must be transferred over the network to the execute machine and back.

Also note that the name of the image, given as the last argument above, is arbitrary: Name it whatever you like, although it may be best to keep the =.raw= suffix as a reminder of the image format.

---++ Write a Submit File

Here is a sample HTCondor submit file to customize for your job:

<pre class="file">
executable              = name-of-job

universe                = vm
vm_type                 = kvm
vm_memory               = 2048
vm_networking           = true
vm_no_output_vm         = false
vm_vnc                  = true

vm_disk                 = cat-base-sl64-amd64-htcondor.dsk:vda:w:raw,my-vm-image.raw:vdb:w:raw
request_disk            = 5.5GB

log                     = run-cluster-$(CLUSTER).log

should_transfer_files   = YES
when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
transfer_input_files    = http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/cat/cat-base-sl64-amd64-htcondor.dsk,my-vm-image.raw
transfer_output_files   = my-vm-image.raw
transfer_output_remaps  = "my-vm-image.raw = my-output-image-$(CLUSTER).$(PROCESS).raw"

queue

# condor_submit will complain about some attributes not being used;
# ignore it until further notice
</pre>

Notes on customizing the submit file attributes:

| *Attribute* | *Usage* |
| =executable= | Unlike a typical HTCondor job, this value is completely arbitrary! It does not need to be =run-job= or your real executable name. It is simply a label to see in =condor_q= output. |
| =vm_memory= | The amount of RAM that your virtual machine will have, in Megabytes; thus, 2048 is 2 GB of RAM. Customize if you know what you are doing! |
| =vm_disk= | Both the base OS image filename and your input-output image filename are listed here. If the names change, change them here, but leave the remaining parts (e.g., =:vda:w:raw=) as in the sample. |
| =transfer_input_files= | These are the filenames of the base OS image and your input-output image. If you change them here, also check =vm_disk= and, for the input-output image filename, =transfer_output_files= and =transfer_output_remaps=. The two base OS image paths are:<br> =http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/cat/cat-base-sl64-amd64-htcondor.dsk= <br> =http://proxy.chtc.wisc.edu/SQUID/cat/cat-base-centos64-amd64-htcondor.dsk= |
| =transfer_output_files= | Names your input-output image as the *one and only* file to transfer back to the submit machine. That is, any changes made to the virtual filesystem *outside of* /mnt/user are discarded after the run. Be sure to use the same input-output image filename here as elsewhere. |
| =transfer_output_remaps= | Renames the input-output image filename upon its return to the submit machine, so that you can keep the job-modified copy separate from the original submitted file. Be sure to use the same input-output image filename here as elsewhere. |


---++ Submit and Monitor a Run

When everything is ready, submit your job to HTCondor as usual:

<pre class="screen">condor_submit my_submit_file.sub</pre>

Other normal HTCondor commands for monitoring and changing your job are available: =condor_q=, =condor_rm=, etc.

---+++ Troubleshooting (NEEDS MORE INFO!!!!!!)

   * If a job goes on hold, check the hold codes and reason:\
     <pre class="screen">condor_q -l <em>JOBID</em> | grep -i hold</pre>\
     <p>If the !HoldReason contains the text =VMGAHP_ERR_INTERNAL=, it probably means that the KVM hypervisor on the execute machine is having problems. Report the bad execute machine to =htcondor-inf@cs.wisc.edu= and release the job so that it tries to run on another machine:\
     <pre class="screen">condor_release <em>JOBID</em></pre>


---++ Extract Outputs

When your =run-job= scripts finishes, the virtual machine guest shuts down and HTCondor completes the job. The input-output image file is transferred back to the submit host and renamed according to the =transfer_output_remaps= attribute in the submit file. If your job produces output, you will need to extract files from the input-output image file to a directory. It is helpful to script this process — see below.

---+++ One-Time Setup Tasks

Creating the image requires extra software on the machine with run-job and the input files. Install the following packages (RPM names verified on el6):

   * libguestfs-tools-c
   * python-libguestfs

Then, write the following Python code to an executable file named, for example, =extract-image.py=:

<pre class="file">
#!/usr/bin/python

import guestfs
import os
import sys

blacklist = set(['/lost+found'])

def print_now(message):
    print message,
    sys.stdout.flush()

g = guestfs.GuestFS()

image_filename = sys.argv[1]
output_dir = sys.argv[2]

if os.path.exists(output_dir):
    print "Output directory '%s' already exists, will not overwrite, try again" % (output_dir)
    sys.exit(1)
os.makedirs(output_dir)

g.add_drive_opts(image_filename, readonly=1, format="raw")

print_now("Extracting files from '%s'..." % (image_filename))
g.launch()

g.mount('/dev/vda', '/')
paths = g.find('/')
for image_path in paths:
    full_image_path = os.path.join('/', image_path)
    if not g.is_dir(full_image_path):
        image_dir = os.path.dirname(image_path)
        local_dir = os.path.join(output_dir, image_dir)
        if not os.path.exists(local_dir):
            os.mkdir(local_dir)
        g.download(full_image_path, os.path.join(output_dir, image_path))

print "ok"
</pre>

---+++ Extracting Files

To extract files from your renamed input-output image file, run the Python command:

<pre class="screen">./extract-image.py my-output-image-<em>job-id</em>.raw my-output-dir-<em>job-id</em></pre>

As shown above, the command expects the renamed input-output image filename to contain the job ID (=cluster.process=). The second argument to the Python script is the name of a new directory to create with the extracted contents from the image.

Instead of the Python script, it is possible to work with the image file directly using the interactive =guestfish= command. [[http://libguestfs.org/ Its documentation]] is available online. Here is a sample invocation and interactive session:

<pre class="screen">
% guestfish --ro --add my-output-image-81.0.raw 

Welcome to guestfish, the libguestfs filesystem interactive shell for
editing virtual machine filesystems.
