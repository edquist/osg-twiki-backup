%TABLE{sort="off"}%
|  *Version*  |  *Testing*  |  *Freeze*  |  *Release*  | *Notes* |
| 3.1.24 | 2013-09-09 | 2013-09-16 | 2013-09-24 | osg-configure, frontier-squid in osg-ce|

*Notes:* Additional “emergency” releases may be scheduled for the 4th Tuesday of each month. The *Testing* date is when acceptance testing will be scheduled for releasable packages; if a package is added after this date, it may not be possible to schedule adequate testing time, thereby forcing it into the next release.

---+++ Notes

*OSG Next:* Carl, !BrianL and Mat need to do scripting for September before Mat leaves.

*osg-test:* We are planning to create a new library for all certificate-related code, which currently lives in the core library, in some tests themselves, and in a separate shell script.

*Test runs on VM universe:* Waiting for HTCondor infrastructure team to provide 6 base OS images.

*HTCondor RPM:* Carl finished script to make source RPM(s) — clean pass-through rebuilds work. Need to meet about how things will work in Batlab automated builds. Carl and !TimT will coordinate passing off this work to flightworthy.

*HTCondor Debian:* !BrianL will meet with !TimT to hand off work and sort out contrib packages.

Late Monday, we decided to do a "emergency" release for osg-configure, due to the fact the we introduced a bug and wanted to limit exposure.  (2 GOC tickets already.)  The focus of the release is osg-configure and pulled and missing testing from the 3.1.23 release.  No new rebuilds (except osg-configure), if testing reveals a problem, ticket gets pushed the next release.
