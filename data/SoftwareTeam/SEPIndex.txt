---++ What is a SEP?

SEP stands for Software Enhancement Proposal. (And it's modeled on the [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/][Python PEPs]].) It describes proposed changes to the OSG softwre stack.

---++ Motivation 

Because the Open Science Grid Software Stack is in use in production sites, we want to have a clear communication channel for proposed changes to the software stack. We should clearly announce what will happen in future versions and allow people time to comment on the proposed changes. The SEPs are the method we will use to communicate these changes. 

We intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing changes to the OSG software stack and for collecting community input on software issues

---++ SEP Types

There are two kinds of SEPs:

   1. *Software:* These propose changes to the software stack.
   1. *Process:* These propose changes to the SEP process. 

---++ SEP Workflow

---+++ Creating an SEP
Anyone in the OSG can create an SEP. The VDT team will create an SEP for every new version of the VDT that will document the proposed changes to the VDT. 

There is an SEP editor, Alain Roy. If you make a new SEP, you should notify him. 

---+++ SEP format
An SEP should have a preamble like the one above, containing the following information:

<pre>
SEP: <sep number>
Title: <the name of the SEP>
Last modified: The date the SEP was last edited.
Created: The date the SEP was created on.
Author: The list of names of people who have edited the SEP.
Status: Draft | Accepted | Rejected | Withdrawn
Type: Software | Process
</pre>
