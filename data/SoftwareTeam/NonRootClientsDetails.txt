---+ Non-Root Installs of OSG Client Software (WIP)

%TOC%

We currently have a large number of hosts across the OSG using the OSG-Client
software installed from Pacman or via some other non-RPM mechanism, due to the
requirement that these packages be installable by non-root users, or that they
may be installed into a non-standard location (such as an NFS share).

We must offer an official way of ensuring that these hosts can have up-to-date
versions of the client software. We must do this without creating a separate
distribution, to reduce the maintenance burden. So we should have some way of
leveraging our existing RPMs for this.

Note: in this document, the term "client" includes the worker node client,
since the =osg-wn-client= package is a subset of the =osg-client= package.


---++ User Interface

We will provide multiple tar archives downloadable from our site.  These
archives will be split up for architecture, distribution version (i.e. RHEL 5
vs. RHEL 6), and collection installed (i.e. worker-node client versus full
client).

The user will need to unpack the archive.  Afterwards, the user will need to
run a script (included in the archive) to configure the software that it will
work from the place where they have unpacked the archive.

Users may have to set environment variables before being able to use the
software. We will provide a file containing these environment variables that
can be sourced.

Example install:
<verbatim class="screen">
   $ tar xvzf osg-wn-client-3.1.14.el5.x86_64.tar.gz
   $ cd osg-wn-client
   $ ./osg-post-install
</verbatim>
and use:
<verbatim class="screen">
   $ . setup.sh
   $ grid-proxy-init
   $ globus-job-run ...
</verbatim>

The software _will not be_ guaranteed to work before running the
=osg-post-install= script, or without sourcing the =setup.sh= file.
Furthermore, the software _will not be_ guaranteed to be relocatable to a
different path_after_ running the =osg-post-install= script.  The software
_will be_ guaranteed to be usable even if running on a different host than the
one that it was installed on, so long as the paths are the same. (This is the
NFS share use case).


---++ Work Needed from the Software Team

In order to maximize maintainability, we will attempt to reuse the RPMs we
currently ship as part of the OSG 3.x software stack as much as possible.
This means that the tarballs will be based directly on the binary RPMs we ship
whenever possible.

However, the presence of hardcoded paths in binaries will require us to modify
and rebuild at least some of the packages to support relocation.

We may be able to (at least partially) reuse some of the scripts and techniques
that we had used for the Pacman-based OSG distribution.

It is hoped that once the basic principles of how we modify the packages are
laid down, the actual work of modifying individual packages can be spread out
over the team as a whole.

The tarballs will be created from the RPMs by a script that we will run as part
of the standard release procedure.

Lists of the packages that comprise the worker-node client and the full client
are provided below.

 
---+++ Packages

These package lists were generated on an sl5 fermicloud machine.  They include
the number of _binary_ files (compiled executables or libraries) that contain
either hardcoded or compiled-in FHS locations. The numbers were obtained using
the attached =find-hardcoded2.sh= script.

Note that in addition to binaries containing paths, there are a number of
configuration files and scripts that contain paths as well. Those are easier
for a post-install script to fix.

It is possible that Globus packages still respect the =$GLOBUS_LOCATION=
environment variable. If that is true, then those packages won't have to be
rebuilt to be relocatable.
