*SHA-2:* Need to do one last round of SHA-2 compliance testing; Neha and Suchandra to work on this. Need to test !DigiCert-signed host and user certificates. !BeStMan testing should wait until after the Tuesday release, just to be sure.

*Documentation:* Marco has some documentation projects assigned to software team members. There are generally JIRA tickets or GOC tickets for people that don’t have JIRA. People encouraged to spend some time on documentation.
