---++ Issues

   * SHA-2 testing: Final testing of !XRootD and !BeStMan/jGlobus. Somewhat delayed due to Fermi outage.
   * !BeStMan/jGlobus: Need to complete packaging and final testing
   * !XRootD: Update plugins for 3.3, possible code changes. !XRootD still does not support GSI authentication on EL6 due to the !OpenSSL version differences between EL5 and EL6. Doug is working with upstream to get these resolved, but we do not expect anything in the near future.
   * CA certificate updater: Complete initial draft and package, test, maybe move to osg-testing?
   * VOMS: ITB testing. Suchandra checking with John Weigand and Steve Timm if they have sites he could use for testing. Xin will do another update test from OSG 1.2 to OSG 3.x with the new VOMS. We would like to get this done by Wednesday so we can decide if we want to include it in the release.
   * GUMS: Read document!, start work on small issues for inclusion in next release
   * RSV bug fixes: In progress, some will be ready for next release
   * Automated testing: Still want more tests and improved infrastructure.
   * Texas Tech (Alan Sill)
