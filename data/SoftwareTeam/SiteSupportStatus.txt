| MIT | FIRE! MIT's CE schedd is thrashing for unknown reasons (they're on 8.3.4, hopefully updating to 8.4.0 today). Getting !JaimeF and !BrianL accounts on the CE for troubleshooting. They have had issues in the past that caused the admin to ban the OSG VO, he has done this again but is still seeing issues. | Max Goncharov | | 10/15/15 |
| FIU | Test pilots submitted but failing. May be due to WN firewall issues. | Mengxing Cheng | [[https://ticket.opensciencegrid.org/26901][GOC]] | 10/15/15 |
| Georgia&nbsp;Tech | Peter was on site to help add more nodes to their torque pool. This broke submission into their pool, qsub seems to be timing out, waiting on admins. .Also, new factory entries need to be added to differentiate AMD vs Intel CPUs. | Patty Carey, Mehmet Belgin, Peter Couvares | [[https://ticket.grid.iu.edu/26560][GOC]] | 10/15/15 |
