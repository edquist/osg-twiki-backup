---+ OSG Software Vulnerability Handling

_DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT_

Goal: Define a software vulnerability handling process separate from the [[IncidentResponseProcess][incident response process]].

---++ Open Issues
   * How are vulnerabilities reported? Via email to vdt-security@cs.wisc.edu?
   * How are vulnerabilities tracked? 
      * Use the [[http://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/support/tickets/][VDT Ticketing System]]?
      * Use the [[https://tick.globalnoc.iu.edu/MRcgi/MRentrancePage.pl][GOC Ticketing System]]?
   * We need a risk assessment methodology.
      * [[http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html][Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)]]
   * We need a disclosure policy/procedure.
      * When to issue a VDT security advisory?
      * When to issue an OSG security advisory?
      * When to send advisories to security contacts?
      * When to issue public advisory?
   * Do we every issue advisories for software not in the VDT (i.e., commonly-used system software, Linux kernel, etc.)?
   * What are the metrics associated with this activity? Who tracks them?
   * What OSG area does this fall under? Software Tools? Security? Software/VDT?
   * Who is in charge? 
      * Alain has overall responsibility as Software Coordinator?
      * Mine is responsibility for risk assessment as Security Officer?
