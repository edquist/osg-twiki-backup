%TOC%

---++ Security Office
Don Petravick is the OSG Security Officer with responsibility for developing the cyber security plan
and enssuring that it is executed.
---+++Security Plan
The OSG Security Plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG-Doc-389]]) 
is one of the deliverables of the OSG project jointly funded by DOE and NSF.
The first accepted version of the plan is delivered and may be revised in the future.  Such revisions may be developed at SecurityPlanning.

---+++ Risk Assessment
The security group has made a first pass at risk assessment and the resulting document is (someplace).

---+++ Awareness and Training Program
The OSG Security Plan ([[https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=389][OSG-Doc-389]]) describes the topics and purpose for security awareness and training for people involved with OSG.
There are two relevent [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/index.html][NIST documents]] that provide guidelines for developing computer security awareness and training programs,
which are [[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-50/NIST-SP800-50.pdf][NIST SP800-50]] and 
[[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-16/800-16.pdf][NIST SP800-16]].  
At present, this program is [[Security.SecurityPlanning#Developing_the_Awareness_and_Tra][being developed.]]

---++Security Technical Group

The Security Technical group is responsible for coordinating the OSG activities that relate to security policy, practices and services. These include:

   * Negotiation of common security principles and expectations for security across the Consortium.
   * Development and oversight of common requirements and architecture for security management across the Consortium.
   * Identification of necessary projects and work needed for a coherent, complete Security infrastructure on the common grid.
   * Published information about storage resources, including monitoring information, and agreements for their use.
   * Interoperability of Security infrastructure across different
      administrative domains, initially OSG and EGEE through the LCG Joint Security Group.

The chairs are Bob Cowles and Jed Dobson. Group membership is approximated by the current membership of the tg-security mailing list. (Send mail to listserv@fnal.gov, leave subject blank, add message contents: REVIEW TG-SECURITY to see current membership.) This list is open to general participation.  You can join or leave the list or review its previous messages via the list [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/tg-security.html][archive page]] if desired.
