---+ Security Email Lists

All email lists are in the opensciencegrid.org domain. 

*security*: Is the standard email address open to the OSG public %RED% for reporting of security incidents %ENDCOLOR%. Mail to *security* is received by the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC). It is 24x7 and filters for SPAM or other off-topic content. Emails to this address opens or updates a security incident ticket, and are forwarded to the INCIDENT-REPORT-L or INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L lists as appropriate (see below). The GOC acts immediately on all mail incoming to this address.

*osg-security-team* is the contact list for the OSG security team.

*tg-security* is open to all OSG members, partners and collaborators. This list includes public data. This list will be used for announcements to our partners and will have a decreased workload compared to the past. 

*security-discuss-l* (also known as *security-discuss-OSG_LIMITED_DISTRIBUTION) is limited to the OSG Security team and other designated staff. It This list is to discuss OSG security team's day-day activities and internal planning.  This list includes limited data, which is only related to OSG business. The limited data is classified as any data that should only be accessed by an authorized group of individuals. The recipients of limited data can re-distribute to third parties if the first recipient deems the third party trustworthy and the re-distribution does not break the use care agreement between the first recipient and the data owner. 

*incident-report-l* is a closed list comprised of the primary grid security contacts for all sites and support centers. The list is intended solely for initial incident reporting - not for incident discussion. All email to this list is echoed to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L and mail REPLY TO: is configured to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L. Because this list is restricted solely to the initial reporting of an incident, inbound communications to this list can be used to drive alerting mechanisms - e.g. alarms in support centers, level-1 messages to Blackberrys, etc. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.

*incident-discuss-l* is a closed list comprised of the same members as INCIDENT-REPORT-L plus other grid security contacts who are concerned with incident discussion. The list is intended for discussion of reported incidents. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.
