*incident-report-l* is a closed list comprised of the primary grid security contacts for all sites and support centers. The list is intended solely for initial incident reporting - not for incident discussion. All email to this list is echoed to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L and mail REPLY TO: is configured to INCIDENT-DISCUSS-L.

*incident-discuss-l* is a closed list comprised of the same members as INCIDENT-REPORT-L plus other grid security contacts who are concerned with incident discussion. The list is intended for discussion of reported incidents. Communications on this list should be PGP signed.
