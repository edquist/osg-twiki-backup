---+ Strategic Goals

---++ Overview

Our center of attention is focused around all ‘at large’ stakeholders (i.e., all Virtual Organizations in Open Science Grid Consortium except CMS, ATLAS, and LIGO). We will coordinate and organize an ‘at large’ Consortium Stakeholder Forum, and our goals for Year 3 fall into five categories.

First, we will make attempts to improve efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility. Second, we will provide an avenue for operational, organizational, and scientific discussions with each ‘at large’ stakeholder by organizing meetings and conferences, using a different scope at different frequencies. We will report and gather feedback in Facility meetings. Third, we will facilitate stakeholder participation in the OSG software engineering lifecycle and in the different areas of grid technology in OSG. This will include mutual exchange of requirements as well as operational needs. Fourth, we will make a strong attempt to enable tactical methods for sustenance of scientific communities that have a newly formed VO. Fifth, we will provide a platform for Storage team to work directly with all stakeholders and thus to strengthen the Data-Grid capabilities of OSG.

---++ Goals for Year3

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *1.	Organize and coordinate an ‘At large’ Consortium Stakeholder Forum, working with ‘at large’ VOs in making effective use of the OSG infrastructure.* </font>

*1.1.	Improve efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility.*
%BR%1.1.1.	Monitor efficiency and usage of all ‘at large’ Science stakeholders regularly, and initiate action for stakeholders that have markedly low wall efficiencies in utilization of OSG.
%BR%1.1.2.	Work with stakeholders, one or a few at a time, to understand known causes of low wall efficiencies, and to possibly suggest measures for improvement. If needed, follow through with Operations, Sites, Storage, Accounting, and peer OSG groups.

*1.2.	Organize meetings and conferences to enable communication.* 
%BR%1.2.1.	Organize a weekly VO forum meeting, often inviting select stakeholders for focused discussion on ongoing operational tasks. 
%BR%1.2.2.	Organize a monthly VO forum meeting, inviting representatives of all ‘at large’ stakeholders, for open “virtual round-table” discussions.
%BR%1.2.3.	Organize an annual face-to-face meeting, inviting representatives of all ‘at large’ stakeholders and key OSG staff, for extensive exchange of operational, organizational, and scientific experiences.
%BR%1.2.4.	On an ongoing basis, provide information to ‘at large’ stakeholders on different areas of grid technology in OSG. In turn, collect stakeholder feedback and operational needs; communicate back to different areas of grid technology in OSG. 
%BR%1.2.5.	If needed, serve as catalyst for transition of new grid technologies into productive use by ‘at large’ stakeholders.
%BR%1.2.6.	Continue to enable Security and Policy matters, related to all ‘at large’ stakeholders, and if needed, also ATLAS, CMS, LIGO.

*1.3.	Compiling of scientific publications by OSG ‘at large’ VOs that resulted from substantial use of the OSG infrastructure.*

*1.4.	Stakeholder participation in OSG software engineering lifecycle.*
%BR%1.4.1.	Toward planning and preparation of a new VDT release, solicit and collect requirements from ‘at large’ stakeholders. Assist in planning of new software features with Project Management and VDT/Middleware teams.
%BR%1.4.2.	Toward validation of a major new incremental OSG release, organize “stakeholder pre-release validation”. Coordinate with ‘at large’ stakeholders and ATLAS, CMS, LIGO to validate, and thus to officially approve, the pre-release using Integration Testbed (ITB).

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *2.	Provide a first stage of sustainment for newly engaged VOs.*  </font>

2.1.	Work with Engagement and Education teams to provide effective support to “new entrants”.
%BR%2.2.	Help Engagement assess readiness of a “new entrant” to officially form a new VO.
%BR%2.3.	Gauge progress of a new VO, suggesting improvement measures if needed.
%BR%2.4.	Help advance MPI resource advertisement for Engagement team. Continue ongoing coordination work with Engagement, GIP, !ReSS teams and MPI resource providers – NERSC, NCSA, Purdue.

%ICON{more}% <font color="#0066ff"> *3.	Help evolve and strengthen the Data-Grid capabilities of OSG.* </font>

3.1.	Enable provisioning of Opportunistic Storage by USCMS and USATLAS sites, by deploying and operating a functional Testbed.
%BR%3.2.	Subsequently, provide guidelines and procedures to enable ‘at large’ stakeholders to leverage usage of Opportunistic Storage.
%BR%3.3.	Identify and execute targeted campaigns of 4-8 weeks duration that allow an ‘at large’ stakeholder to transition from no use of opportunistic storage, to successful use at sites that support this stakeholder for opportunistic computing and storage.
