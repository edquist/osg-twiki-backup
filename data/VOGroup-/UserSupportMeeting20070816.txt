----+++ Users' Meeting <em>post mortem</em> and closeout

----++++ Discussion

   * Abhishek giving talk at a local meeting tomorrow. Will borrow content from the talk I gave at the Site meeting; need to keep it short, though.

   * Abhishek and Chris agreed that action items documented in wrap-up discussion slides should be tracked and escalated by us in consultation with EB.

----++++ Action

   * Chris: distill the wrap-up items into well-defined issues for discussion with EB.

----+++ User Survey

----++++ Discussion

   * Need to act on action items distilled from survey.

   * Lynn said she lacks the data to fill in the survey appropriately this time. Chris agreed this was an appropriate response for the nonce.

----++++ Action

   * Abhishek: Review surveys to distill action items.

---+++ Year 2 Plan

----++++ Discussion

   * Chris and Abhishek agreed that the plan had probably shifted during negotiations between Chander and Frank relative to that latest copy to which we have access.

----++++ Action

   * Abhishek: follow up with Frank and Chander.

---+++ VO application validation of ITB

----++++ Discussion

   * Abhishek agreed to handle this as per the pre-0.6.0 exercise. Right now not enough ITB sites up for meaningful application testing, but this is on the agenda for the ITB meeting this afternoon.

----++++ Action

   * Abhishek: handle coordination of application validation for pre-0.8.0 ITB.

---+++ Other current issues

---++++ MPI

   * From Mats by email:<blockquote>There are several things going on with the MPI effort. First thing is that we are waiting for some feedback from the executive team. The second thing is that we are forming a little interest group between Purdue, Notre Dame and Engagement who will work out issues together. More on this next week.</blockquote>

---+++++ Action

   * Mats: More on MPI next week.

---++++ CHEP demo.

   * From Mats by email: <blockquote>The CHEP demo is moving along fine. I have seen an early version of the visualization part, and will hopefully have a final version on Monday. I will then make a movie, and put it in the Powerpoint slides.</blockquote>

---+++ AOB.

   * Abhishek and Chris welcomed Britta and Maxim to the team.

   * Couple of question from Ligo via Britta:
      1. -- milestone -- run 1000 jobs simultaneously on OSG.<verbatim>Test runs -- idle, running, sites, workflows
             1060, 500,     17,    48
             1889, 807,     21,    84</verbatim><p>Data transfer bottleneck -- overloading data servers at PSU and Milwaukee. Need to increase site support and fix those sites which claim to support LIGO but don't.</p>
      2. How to get list of supported sites?

   * ILC -- Lynn -- User Survey; parallel application request, details in forwarded email.

   * Next week's meeting to be open agenda.

---++++ Action

   * Chris: send details of programmatic VORS listing to Britta and discussion of bottleneck problem.

   * Chris: receive email chain details from Lynn and start dialog with application requesters on technical details.

   * Chris: next Tuesday, advertise open agenda meeting on =osg-users= and =osg-general=.
