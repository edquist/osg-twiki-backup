---+ nanoHUB Notes & Plans 
---+++ 8/22/2008 
---+++ Goals
<pre>(1) Understand possibility of different conventions, and thus variations 
in job accounting; nanoHUB vis-a-vis Gratia. 
(2) Try to diagnose causes of low job success rates. 
(3) Suggest, and move forward, measures to improve job success rates, 
i.e., nanoHUB efficiency. This can be an extensive exercise. 
(4) Then, encourage nanoHUB to increase utilization of OSG Facility. 
(5) Solicit nanoHUB's citing OSG usage in publications and in scientific results.

Toward (1), work is again in progress with Philippe Canal, Steve 
Clark, Preston Smith. We are trying to collect job statistics from 
Purdue site.

Toward (2) and beyond, Steve explained that nanoHUB jobs have very 
high memory requirements. There is a possibility that, in past, jobs 
were not matched well with sites on OSG Facility. Looking at the 
statistics presented by nanoHUB at BNL Mtg in June'08 earlier, 
application performance for all 3 types (NANOFET, CNTFET, NANOWIRE) is 
indeed correlated with specific sites. I think, if this is true, 
changes in nanoHUB's workflow may be needed, and will suffice to bring 
noticeable improvement. Steve agreed, but mentioned that going about 
the process may be non-trivial within nanoHUB.

In sum, we agreed that we can move forward in sequence, and Steve is 
available for discussions every alternate week. Our current focus is 
(1). Philippe and Abhishek will keep everyone posted as we move forward.</pre>
