---++ Agenda

---+++ Issues from last week.

   * Chris spoke to Steve Clark: main discussion on last week's minutes; resulting action item:
      * Ticket 3060 brought to the attention of the troubleshooting team: Suchandra has taken ownership.
   * Mats' problems with UCSD and LIGO: both are due to his tests setting an attribute based on a fork test when it should have been done on the WN: UCSD's was writing to =OSG_APP=; LIGO was external network connectivity -- no formal follow-up although discussions are continuing with UCSD.
   * Parag reported to the troubleshooting meeting today: subject to one open ticket (3518) regarding storage access at UNL, D0 is running smoothly and usage is ramping down now.
