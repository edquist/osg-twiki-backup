---++ Agenda

---++ Status of Pending Action Items
   * [CG] From All Hands meeting - make matrix of VO vs Site from VO tests "hello world" execution.
   * [MA] Work through corrected VO contacts list and start contacting VOs for AUPs and Registration policies, think about VO Security Contact security training.
   * [AR] How do we get priorities and schedules for VO middleware requests?
      * Ball in Alain's court. Will be talking to Alain and Chander as soon as they are available.

---++ Meetings:

   * All-hands round-up, including Bio workshop.
      * Slides from Abhishek's talk at the Area Coordinators' meeting to be uploaded.
      * One particular point: Miron mentioned in Bio workshop that in the long run it might be advantageous to have a "biology club" within the OSG user community. What form would this take? Who would own?
         * Maxim -- not much commonality yet between the different groups.
         * Mats -- agree. Biology is a large field, with many differences. 
         * Abhishek -- Job submission flows are quite complicated.
      * Maxim: observations from workshop:
         * PANDA needs some minor work before CHARMM is ready to go.
         * !CompBioGrid engineer very impressive.
      * Chris: elements of commonality in portal approach?
         * Maxim: both !CompBioGrid and !SBGrid well advanced and probably divergent.
      * Mats: some people missing: couple of engagement users and other campus users.
         * Should stay in touch with !CompBioGrid and !SBGrid to keep momentum going and get early intervention on problems.
      * Ruth: email of users to try to target to get onto OSG?
         * Mats: OK.
         
   * "General" workshop at BNL.
   * Face to face at BNL.
