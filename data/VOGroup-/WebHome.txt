---++ Mission Statement

<table width="100%"><tr><td valign="top"></td><td valign="middle" width="50%">
OSG User Group serves as liaison between <font color=#003399><b>Science Communities</b></font>, commonly structured as Virtual Organizations (VOs), who use the OSG grid cyber-infrastructure and the OSG Executive Board. User Group works with the Middleware, Operations, Applications, Security, Storage, Sites coordination groups to address requirements, feedback, issues and roadmaps.

In this capacity, User Group aims to understand the <i>desiderata</i> - expectations and operational aspects - of running VO applications on OSG. As need arises, the group also provides accelerated support to enable VOs' science milestones, serves as an ad-hoc platform for communication across [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/VO_List][all the VOs]], and represents Users' requirements and interests to fulfill [[http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/Learn_About_Us/Our_Mission][OSG's mission]].

---++ Mailing Lists & News

The <u>OSG Users list</u> (=osg-users at opensciencegrid dot org=), [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-users.html][archived here]], consists of representatives of all officially registered stakeholding VOs in the OSG, and is the primary medium for circulation of important announcements and news items. This list also serves as a general VO/user discussion forum. Representatives of newly formed VOs are strongly encouraged to [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=osg-users&A=1][subscribe to the list]]. A very small subset of announcements is occasionally also posted on the [[UserGroupNewsItems][news page]].

The <u>OSG User Group Coordination list</u> (=osg-user-group at opensciencegrid dot org=) consists of the OSG User Group Coordinators, OSG Applications Coordinators, and the OSG Executive Director. A VO interested in communicating with the coordination team can feel free to [[mailto:OSG-USER-GROUP@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG][send an email to this list]] anytime.
