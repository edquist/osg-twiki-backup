---++ Mailing Lists and News

The <u>OSG Users list</u> (=osg-users at opensciencegrid dot org=), [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/archives/osg-users.html][archived here]], consists of representatives of all officially registered stakeholding VOs in the OSG, and is the primary medium for circulation of important announcements and news items. This list also serves as a general user discussion forum. Representatives of newly formed VOs are strongly encouraged to [[http://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=osg-users&A=1][subscribe to the list]]. A very small subset of announcements is occasionally also posted on the [[UserGroupNewsItems][news page]].

The <u>OSG User Group Coordination list</u> (=osg-user-group at opensciencegrid dot org=) consists of the OSG User Group Coordinators, OSG Applications Coordinators, and the OSG Executive Director. A VO interested in communicating with the coordination team can feel free to [[mailto:OSG-USER-GROUP@OPENSCIENCEGRID.ORG][send an email to this list]] anytime.
