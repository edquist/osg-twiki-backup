---++ Welcoming Stakeholders to year 3 (Miron, OSG Facility)
   * A key goal is to maximize utilization of OSG resources.

---++ Stakeholders' introductions, views, opinions (All VOs in attendance)
   * nanoHUB: Satisfied with job-accounting discrepancy resolution. Focus in near future is to look into site selection and job efficiency improvements.
   * Fermilab-VO: Consists of 12-14 sub-groups, all working well. Plan is to be active in future weekly VO forum meetings.
   * DES: Uses both OSG and !TeraGrid. Expects to have more uniform site configuration (Miron: unlikely to happen due to heterogeneity). Need is to gather more accurate information before jobs are submitted to OSG. (Gabriele: Can !ReSS help with information gathering?). Plan is to be active in future weekly VO forum meetings.
   * D0: Productivity has increased immensely. Looking for more storage sites to run on, hoping to see more improvements in near future. 
   * DOSAR: No specific requirements at this point. There is interest in MPI.
   * CDF: All working well. No specific requirements at this point. Plan is to be active in future weekly VO forum meetings.
   * NWICG: Primarily, a resource provider. No requirements at this point. Plan is to stay in communication with VO Group.
   * CIGI: Plan is to ramp up activity in next 6-12 months.

---++ Any Other Business
   * Next bi-monthly VO forum will be held beginning of December.
