---+!! OSG 1.0 Planning: Requirements set forth by VOs

---++!! Overview and Goal

The next major middleware release, OSG 1.0, is scheduled for a February 2008 rollout. This document is a compendium of <u>%MAROON%requirements%ENDCOLOR%</u> being set forth by the VO community, in view of <u>%MAROON%needs and expectations of running VO applications on OSG 1.0%ENDCOLOR%</u>. 

Immediate goals are: (1) To provide input to the OSG Executive Board, as well as to the Middleware, Operations, and the Sites coordination groups. (2) To encourage VOs to set and convey the expectations ahead of schedule.

If needed for reference, please see [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/SiteValidationTable#VO_validation][archived ITB 0.7 validation table]] with results of activity immediately prior to OSG 0.8 release.

*Modular packages/components*

   * Site admin can choose to install/uninstall a stand-alone component (such as GIP) without installing the whole OSG CE.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                 
*GUMS*                                                                                                                                                               

   * Map VOMS proxies from a particular user but different VOs to different pool accounts, even if all pool accounts are in one persistence factory.                                                                                             

*Globus Gatekeeper*                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                      
   * In general, improved gatekeeper scalability and fault tolerance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
   * Load balancing w/ LVS (?)                                                                                                                                       
   * High availability                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
   * Some kind of CE throttling to prevent CE from being impacted by !DoS.                                                                                               
   * Quota based on # jobs in batch system     
   * Quota by user and/or VO                                                                                                                                         
   * Throttling by CE load (?)                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                       
*Globus JobManager*
                                                                                                                                                                      
   * Some mechanism to add processing to condor.pm (plugin), e.g., to add custom site-specific flags based on user, group, etc.                                                                                                                
                  
*RSV/Service availability monitoring*

   * A complete set of baseline service availability probes to monitor LHC Tier 1/Tier 2 services (CE, SE/SRM, FTS, MyProxy, BDII).  The test results can be easily integrated into site admin monitoring server (such as Nagios).                                                                                                                                                             

   * OSG availability monitoring needs to inter-operate with WLCG.  
   * a single web interface (gridview) shows WLCG/OSG/EGEE availability metrics.
   * scheduled downtime should be recognized by OSG availability monitoring, and availability metric should properly reflect the service downtime.                                                                                                                                                            

*GRATIA / Accounting*                                                                                                                                                 

   * Add ability to define subclusters, and specify submission method such                                                                                             
 that an accounting record is a triple (subcluster, submit host, user-vo). Or                                                                                         
 at least have an implicit mechanism for multiple Gratia instances run on                                                                                             
 different submit hosts to report records as part of a single site.                                                                                                   

*GIP*       

   * Support SRM 1 and SRM 2 (dCache Cell information provider,  xrootd), and allow SRM admin to easily publish static/dynamic information to OSG.

*BDII and/or WLCG BDII*

   * Make plugin that allows the site admin to fine-tune reported info, e.g., reporting each Condor VM as job slot instead of dividing by 2 or 4.

*Network performance test*
                                                                                                                                                                      
   * iperf:  Authorized users can remotely start an iperf server by running globus-job-run to test the network performance.

   * A need to have extra RSL field(s) to run only on WNs with larger than 4GB memory.

---++ *CMS*   %Y%

*Compute services*

   * Multiple CE for a single site.                                                                                                                                     
   * Better logfile format for parsing.                                                                                                                                  
   * Better scalability (always).      

*GIP*

   * Advertising wall clock time and having gip advertise this.

*Packaging*

   * Alternative to pacman for installer.                                                                                                                                
   * A possible introduction of complete rpm based installation. 

*Storage clients*

   * Functional srmcp clients that work with srm v1 as well as v2. This does not have to necessarily be one client, but could be multiple. 
   * Ability to interoperate with LCG sites' storage, i.e., FTS clients would need to be distributed.                                                                                                                                  
   * A possible inclusion of lcg-utils-lite, which would bring in the LCG's set of (high quality) client bindings for SRM, RFIO, dCap, and GridFTP.

*CEMon and ReSS*

   * Get an up-to-date version of CEMon  (which, as is understood, the ReSS project will be working on shortly).                                                               
                    
*NMI build related benign error messages*
                                                                                                                                                   
   * Clean up the various ugly error messages such as those in voms-proxy-init which are due to artifacts in the NMI build                                                                                                            system used by the VDT.  We get lots of user questions about these "harmless" warnings and are spending lots of time on them.                                                                                                       
   
*WS-GRAM advertisement*
                                                                                                                                                                    
   * Some way in the information system, ad-hoc though it may be, to advertise the presence of WS-GRAM

   * A systematic way for campus grids to insert extra fields into the GIP without breaking LCG/OSG interoperability                                                                                                                
   * Ways to at least advertise compatibility-breaking site differences such as nfs-lite, initialdir, etc.                                                                                                                                     
  
*CA and CRL certificates management*
                                                                                                                                                                     
   * Addition of the "csync" package (written and submitted by us) to the VDT for CA/CRL distribution. 
            
---++ *LIGO*   %Y%

*Wider deployment of WS-GRAM and Squid*

   * LIGO is pursuing a new analysis to run on the OSG. This analysis has experiences on the German Grid (DGRID). From our communications with the developers in Europe, we believe that WS-GRAM and SQUID will be important technologies for accelerating the successful migration of                                                                                                    this new application onto the OSG. 
   * We are aware that there are already successes with SQUID and WS-GRAM at specific OSG sites. Any possibilities for making these successes more widely available would be of interest to LIGO. We are in early phases of this application port                                                                                                   so the timeline for the next OSG release would be most reasonable for larger scale running.
