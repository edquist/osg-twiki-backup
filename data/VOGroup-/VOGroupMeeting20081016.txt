---+ VO Group Weekly Forum | October 16, 2008

   * Thursdays 1:30 PM Central Time. 
   * Phone (510) 665-5437, Meeting ID 1111. 

---+++ Attending

Mine Altunay (OSG Security), Britta Daudert (VO group in OSG), Steve Clark (nanoHUB), Nikolay Kuropat (DES VO), Steve Timm (Fermi VO), Abhishek Singh Rana (VO group in OSG), Marcia Teckenbrock (OSG Communications) 

---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VOGroupMeeting20081009][Previous week's minutes]]
---++ 1) VOs in focus

---+++ nanoHUB
   * Step 2: efficiency 
   * site selectionjob scheduling/work-flow management: Steve talked to Brian Bockelman; the display to monitor site status is not sufficient. nanoHUB uses VORS first, but it doesn't reflect actual status of sites (Fermi VO agrees). LIGO uses ReSS--likewise, info not always accurate.
   * Suggestion is to form a task force w/ members from OSG Accounting, Metrics, a GOC members as needed, OSG Condor team. Abhishek will work to determine who's on it.
   * CA Cert transition: nanoHUB has not yet made the transition. Steve will talk to Mine offline.
---+++ DES

---+++ ILC

User eductionfor indiv. users is the current effort. It's unclear whether help is needed from OSG yet, but it was suggested that osg-edu VO may be appropriate to get new users started right away. Low job failure and wasted wallclock hours. They are not using any sit selection service, as they are funning on Fermigrid only.

---+++ Fermi VO

Steve feels Fermi groups are using OSG resources as much as possible. There's a lot of peaks and a lot of downtime for various experiments. Most Fermi users don't run offsite, but that will surely change in the future.

Issue? Fermi VO takes all VOs but all VOs don't take Fermi VO. They are worried that everyone at Fermi is automatically in the gridmap file. Upper managment will have to decide how to handle this.
---+++ CDF VO

---++ 2) Inactive VOs

Britta & Abhishek are classifying VOs into following categories:
   * active and doing science 
   * providing resources 
   * OSG-specific 
   * inactive 
      * inactive, but likely to ramp up effort 
      * inactive, unlikely to ramp up effort. 

   * CompBioGrid, Ion: expecting to ramp up within two weeks. 
   * Mariachi, John: is working towards greater usage; currently not using OSG facilities but using OSG software, hoping for utilization within 2 months. 
   * fMRI & Gadu: no response to e-mail query made by Britta. (Don't have contact anymore because individuals associated with VOs have left their positions. 
   * GPN: David Swanson at Nebraska said they were ramping up. 
   * ILC: ramping up. As they're learning how to use the infrastructure, their job submission rate is improving. 
   * Geant 4: no response to e-mail query. Maybe you have to go through the GGUC (European equiv. of GOC)? Abhishek will think about how to proceed. 
   * I2U2:hoping to do student project on the grid; project still active; don't know if they still want to use grid. Abhishek will think about how to proceed. 
   * SBGrid has task force at work 
   * I2U2: educational VO 
---++ 2) AOB

---++ Pending Action Items
---+++ Concerning Inactive VOs
   * Geant 4, I2U2 have been non-responsive, contact again at a later point 
   * Mariachi, ComBioGrid (likely ramping up), contact in two weeks to check on progress 
   * fMRI, GADU (likely ceasing operation) have been non-responsive, Ruth, Miron to be informed
