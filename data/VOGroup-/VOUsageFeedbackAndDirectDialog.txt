---+++ *How does this work?*
This is a <u>%MAROON%goal-oriented%ENDCOLOR%</u> and now biannual exercise, intended <u>%MAROON%to engage in a direct dialog with VOs%ENDCOLOR%</u> which derive science benefits from use of OSG resources. We provide each VO with a dedicated page complete with monthly usage plots for the last two quarters and a few questions. Usage plots are based on daily usage by site for a VO, as reported by Gratia OSG accounting. 

After each VO has answered the questions, we convey the results to the Executive teams. In response to your feedback, if any action is needed to improve your satisfaction, appropriate measures will be taken as soon as possible. <u>%MAROON%This is primarily for your, the VO's benefit!%ENDCOLOR%</u> We thank you in advance for taking out time to complete this exercise.

---+++ *What do we expect you to do?*

Please note the 'VO Participation table' below, and visit the twiki page of VO you represent. Analyze the usage plots we have provided and fill-in answers to the questions on your VO's own twiki page. You can fill-in by using the 'Edit' button beneath the 'Dialog Table' for this quarter. Use '%MAROON%br%ENDCOLOR%' with angle brackets to add line breaks if needed. If everything is in order, anticipated time needed to complete the answers is only a handful of minutes.
