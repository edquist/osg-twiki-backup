More details on Frank's idea:

<ul>
  <li>Frank wants to set up a !TWiki area showing plots with usage (or jobs) by site for each VO.</li>
  <li>UG will review plots and use to form useful target questions about previous usage patterns, possible problems and future plans, requirements and solutions.</li>
  <li>Gratia already has a plot that *almost* does the job: !UsageBySiteForVO. Currently difficult due to different VO names meaning (almost) the same thing. New release of Gratia will have VO correspondence table; expect this next week.</li>
