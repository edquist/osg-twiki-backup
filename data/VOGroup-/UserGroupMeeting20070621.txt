   * We learned a little bit more about Pegasus and LIGO: basically Pegasus have recently added several features aimed specifically at LIGO's OSG needs:
      * Workspace cleanup during workflow.
      * OSG site layout
      * Integration with VORS

   * Karan will be visiting !CalTech in July and will discuss with them.
   * Britta (surname) is the new David Meyers, also getting a new hire.

   * Attending for both days.
   * Chris asked Karan to register with Indico.

   * Karan to register.
   * Karan to visit !CalTech and discuss.
