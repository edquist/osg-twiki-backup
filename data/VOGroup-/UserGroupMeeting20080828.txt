---++ Agenda

---+++ D0 (Joel Snow & Andrew Baranovski), and related work with OSG Storage
   * [[D0Notes][View complete discussion as summarized by Abhishek]] 
   * Goal: Try to improve D0's efficiency of utilization of OSG Facility, and declare any final limitations. 
      * D0 encounters high job failure rates at many OSG sites. Main causes are SAM remote cache transfer failures, WAN latencies, and related timeouts during data stage-in and data stage-out. It has been demonstrated by D0 and OSG teams that use of SRM-based SE local to a site improves the job success rates significantly. 
      * OSG Storage has helped setup new SEs at Purdue and MIT sites. MIT has dCache pool nodes behind NAT. Andrew has found a solution. 
   * Ongoing D0 analysis:

   * Recommendation for USCMS sites: http://datagrid.ucsd.edu/opportunistic 

---+++ nanoHUB (Steve Clark), and related work with OSG Accounting

   * [[NanohubNotes][View complete discussion as summarized by Abhishek]] 
   * There is a discrepency between Gratia and Nanohub statistics 
      * work ongoing 
      * failure rates high; nanohub to look at cause of failures (application vs OSG site-related issue? 
         *
