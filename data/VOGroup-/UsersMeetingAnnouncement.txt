---+ !! Users' Meeting draft announcement 

This is the working draft of the Users' Meeting announcement email. Please edit as desired. The aim at this point is to have the completed draft to the EB Monday morning.

The draft below includes ideas for presentations; although very few potential speakers have yet been contacted.

---++ Draft

This is the first announcement of the Open Science Grid Users' Meeting, to be held at FNAL on July 26th and 27th 2007. This meeting / workshop is aimed at *all users* of the OSG who meet any of the following criteria:

   * are responsible for or develop applications that run on the OSG;
   * are VO managers or their delegates;
   * are involved in any aspect of VO-specific infrastructure for OSG use, for example: workflow, meta-scheduling or portal management;
   * are users or prospective users of the OSG in any capacity and are interested in discussing issues and their solutions; or hearing about others' issues and how they may have been solved.

The emphasis in this meeting will be on sharing issues and ideas and discussing current and future needs across the  users of and participants in OSG. The goal is to help each other and have ideas on how to help new entrants to the OSG.

While there will be some presentations we want to leave plenty of time for discussion and interaction. 
Anyone who has something to say which would fit in to one of the meeting's sessions should feel free to submit their talk, and we will have some space for short on-the-fly presentations as well. 

Some other pertinent facts about the meeting:

   * There is no registration fee.
   * Please [[https://indico.fnal.gov/confRegistrationFormDisplay.py/signIn?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Findico.fnal.gov%2FconfRegistrationFormDisplay.py%2Fdisplay%3FconfId%3D870&amp;confId=870][register]] at our Indico portal.
   * There will be a pay-as-you-go group dinner the evening of the 26th. Please indicate at registration whether you plan to attend.
   * The emphasis of this meeting will be on multi-directional information exchange -- discussion and collaboration, and less on monologues. We will allow time for discussion after each presentation; issue-oriented sessions will allow some dedicated time for discussion after all presentations in that session.
   * Wireless network access will be available; please see Indico for registration details and pre-requisites.
