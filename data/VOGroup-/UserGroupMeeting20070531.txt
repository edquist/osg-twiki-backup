   * Announcement email sent to OSG general, integration and user lists, cc'd to EB.

---+++ !MiniBooNE group of Fermilab VO

---++++ Discussion

   * Chris described work done over the last week with !MiniBooNE transferring their operations to a push model for their next large production MC run. Many problems, most of which stemming from (we think) a known bug in Condor 6.8.4 regarding handling of delegated credentials. Worked around by submitting from a machine _other than_ the executing CE; and by removing vestigial =myproxy= code in the user's startup profile. Frank, could your X509_CERT_DIR problem be due to something like this?
   * Also tripped over apparently well-known problems with GRAM not transferring condor / exec status code back to submitting node. Not known whether this is GT2-only or affects GT4.

---++++ Action

   * Chris: follow up with Frank to see if this applies to his problem also.
   * Chris: ascertain whether GRAM trouble also exists in WS.

---+++ Issues for OSG 0.8.0

---++++ Discussion

   * Discussed renewing call to VOs for requirements. Decided that time was getting short before 1.8.0 cut, so probably shouldn't advertise too loudly for stuff we probably couldn't deliver. Follow up with one or two specific groups.
   * Chris asked about version of Condor slated for 0.8; and whether glexec was to be packaged and a default install.
   * Chris also asked about WS plans.

---++++ Action

   * Abhishek: follow up with ATLAS.
   * Chris: ask about current Condor; <strike>glexec</strike> and WS plans.

---+++ Other current issues

None.

---+++ AOB.

   * New mailing list [[mailto:osg-user-group@opensciencegrid.org][osg-user-group]], owners me, Abhishek and Frank; members me, Abhishek, Frank, Torre and Ruth.
