|  *OSG User Satisfaction Survey Questions*  ||
| 1 |  Does Gratia accounting (attached usage plots) reflect your understanding of your use of OSG in the last 3 months?  |
| 2 |  Do you expect your usage pattern to remain the same for the next 3 months? If not, please comment on expected change.  |
| 3 |  Are you satisfied with your operations experience on OSG in the last 3 months? If not, please feel free to provide detailed comments.  |

| 1 |  To the best of my knowledge, these Gratia Plots reflect my understanding of LIGO usage on the OSG. Surprisingly, the third quarter plot shows more sites allowing LIGO access than I have previously thought possible. |
| 2 |  LIGO has a milestone to reach a peak job usage of 1000 jobs on the OSG sometime in September. If LIGO is to meet this milestone, it will need to run substantially more jobs than it has in the past. My understanding is that our historical peak utilization is at about 3-4 hundred jobs (from MonoLISA not Gracia). I don't know what renormalization has to be applied between the two tools to compare but I expect we will be pushing harder in the future. |
| 3 |  In the past three months LIGO has been struggling with a problem of having directory creation fail. The troubleshooting and the condor developers are working on this but after more than a month on this problem it has not been fixed, or even understood. I believe circumstantially that this problem showed up about the time of one of the globus security releases but this has not been proven to be related through troubleshooting or other debugging exercises. This has held LIGO back and made our experiences less than ideal. Also, I should point out that LIGO workflows are designed to move a lot of data and then do a lot of number crunching on the data once it is in place. The limited data storage availiable in the current "generic" OSG site model does not allow for a critical amount of data movement to spark interest in our user community to look deeper into the OSG resources for our data analysis needs. I'm optimistic that in the future, that a generic data storage evolution will turn this around for our user community. |
