---+ *Agenda*

---++ [[VOGroupMeeting20081016][Previous week's minutes]]
---++ 1) VOs in focus
---+++ D0

D0 is having infrastructure problems today, which people are working on. UNL SRM transfers are problematic; Joel will submit GOC ticket. There are no other OSG-specific issues from Joel.

D0 article in iSGTW did not mention D0 contributions (Marcia's original article did). iSGTW working on process for vetting. Qizhong appreciates that line was added to iSGTW article. She also appreciates the OSG contributions to increasing efficiency in MC production. 

---+++ nanoHUB

From Abhishek: Work has started w/ Miron, Jamie Frey & the Engagement team to look at job submission workflow (site selection, specifically). Abhishek coordinating effort b/t Condor and nanoHUB 
---+++ NYSGrid

NYSGrid has increased its activity as both a resource provider and running jobs.

Researchers across the state have various applications (not one single app), some open source, some commerical. There's an MPI app called AMBER and an commercial MPI app called COBALT, a lot of MPI apps. 

Plans a workshop in December to get more researchers online and to provide tutorials. They have put a cookbook together based on experiences.  

Their resouces are mainly at Buffalo, but also at Niagra, Albany & Syracuse. 

GRASE is being used more for testing purposes by Russ Miller and his students. If it is not being used for production, makes sense to limit access at some sites. 

---+++ DES

Requirements were conveyed to ET. Abhishek noted that DES doesn't show up as independent VO. He will discuss w/ Steve Timm.

Noted also: they are using SRM all the time on all sites where they are able to submit job (brings data back to Fermilab). People at NCSA were trying to copy data from FNAL and were successful.

In future, will probably want to increase number of sites they can run on. 

---+++ CDF

CDF is running various physics analysis applications, and only one class of these is capable of running offsite (Monte Carlo). Typical usage pattern is peaks and valleys. Last week were able to run 1000 jobs a a time, mainly on UCSD, MIT & Florida as part of a "CAF attack." It would be nice to pursue opportunistic compute resources for these circumstances (needed in December). Dennis & Abhishek will talk offline.
---++ 2) Security

Jim notes that all VOs present are registered in OIM. Encourages any security issues to be addressed to security @ opensiencegrid.org
