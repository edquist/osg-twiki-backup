---++ Goal
---+++ *How does this work?*

This is a quarterly exercise, intended to collect direct feedback from VOs which derive science benefits from use of OSG resources. We provide each VO with a dedicated page complete with monthly usage plots for the past quarter and 3 survey questions. Usage plots are based on daily usage by site for a VO, as reported by Gratia accounting. After each VO has answered the questions, we report the results to the Executive Team. In response to your feedback, if any action is needed to improve your satisfaction, appropriate measures will be taken as soon as possible. <u>This is primarily for your, the VO's benefit!</u> We thank you in advance for taking out time to complete the survey.
