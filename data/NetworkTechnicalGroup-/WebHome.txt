The Open Science Grid  relies on production and research networks to connect the resources accessible to the distributed facility.

To date we have relied on External Projects to work with us to provide the necessary network management, throughput and monitoring capabilities. 

This is a web-based collaboration area for (surprisingly) the Network Technical group.

The Network Technical Group coordinates OSG activities related to networks and their use in grids, to enable OSG to achieve the levels of routine end-to-end network performance and reliability required for present and future scientific grids.  Specific areas of focus include:

   * Consideration of the connectivity capabilities available and required amongst OSG sites

   * Determination of the needs of OSG Organizations, especially related to the need to import and export data of varying sizes and priorities to and from the grid sites.

   * Documenting networking needs of OSG sites and providing feedback to network providers.

   * Relating new networking concepts and capabilities (e.g., UltraLight http://www.ultralight.org, TeraPaths http://www.atlasgrid.bnl.gov/terapaths, Lambda Station http://www.lambdastation.org/, OSCARs http://www.es.net/oscars/, Internet2 HENP activities http://henp.internet2.edu, etc) to OSG deployments.

   * Developing and deploying new network services, applications and interfaces in support of OSG.

The Chairs are Shawn McKee and Don Petravick. Group membership is approximated by the membership of the tg-networks mailing list. (Send mail to listserv@fnal.gov, leave subject blank, add message contents: REVIEW TG-NETWORKS)
