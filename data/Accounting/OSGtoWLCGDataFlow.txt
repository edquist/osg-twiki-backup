---+!! Accounting data workflow from OSG to WLCG

%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%

---++ Introduction
There is some confusion about how the OSG accounting data is being collected, processed and sent over to WLCG accounting portal. This documentation is an effort to try to explain that process. Please also look at the <a href=https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/GratiaInterfacesApelLcg>APEL/WLCG document</a>, which explains the bulk of the process that is done in order to send data from OSG to the WLCG. Other useful references are also provided at the bottom of this page. 

---++ Accounting data workflow from OSG to WLCG

<ol>
<li> Every OSG site publishes its sub cluster information (CPU model, # of
cores etc.) in the "Subclusters" section of the OSG config.ini file.
This information is sent to the GIP.
          
<li> A normalization factor (NFgip) is arrived at based on the SI2K value
calculated for the different sub clusters. For example for WT2 NFgip is
3.197. This NF value is used to convert the raw CPU time and wall time
into a Normalized value representing a fair means of comparing data
across a wide variety of grid clusters.

<li> Simultaneously the gratia probes at the site collect job data (Number
of jobs, CPU time, Wall time, VO, time etc.) and send it over to the
central gratia collector.

 <li> The WLCG script that runs at FNAL extracts the gratia data, adjusts
(multiples to be exact) it using the normalization factor (not sure why
3.424 is used for WT2 instead of 3.197) and sends it over to WLCG. This
is done once a day. The data sent is cumulative for that month. For    
example here is the data that would be sent over to WLCG for WT2 if the
script executes now.

</td></tr><tr bgcolor=white><td>

</td></tr></table>
   
<li> More insight needs to be gained into the workflow on the WLCG side like   
how the data is being used to generate the reports etc. If the 
understanding is right, WLCG multiples the NF calculated using SI2K by
4 (13.696 for WT2) and uses it as the HS06 NF equivalent.
</ol>

---++Questions
<ul>
<li> Workflow on the WLCG side after receiving data from OSG and how this data is used to create the WLCG report
<li> Details about how gratia accounts for hyperthreaded or multicore jobs
<li> How exactly does GIP calculate the Normalization factor for a site?
<li> Why is WT2 using 3.424 instead of 3.197 as its normalization factor?
<li> Why is the normalization fator still calculated based on KSI2K and not HS06?
</ul>
