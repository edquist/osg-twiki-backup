Currnet List of Priorities for the Gratia Project.

We are planning on delivering to Fermilab and BNL a beta version of the Condor Probe and Probe library by April 14.
The features planned for this prototypes are:
	* Support of several releases/configuration of Condor (xml and non xml log files, with or without Quill).
	* Simple configuration (centralized collector at fermilab)
	* Semi-manual match between vos and users.

Still working on:
	* Packaging
	* Condor probe parsing/scheduling
	* Facility/Farm determination

For Fermilab we are also working on an adaptation of the fermi process accounting framework to the Gratia Framework.
This will be used to replace some manual steps and to cross check the information obtained from the Condor probe.

For OSG 0.6 (June 2006), we are planning on delivering a beta version of Probe and Collector.
The features planned for this prototype are:
	* Prototy of the detection of 'amount' of information not reported by the probe (due to failure of the probe and/or the batch system).
	* Better detection/discovery of the VO belonging to a user.
