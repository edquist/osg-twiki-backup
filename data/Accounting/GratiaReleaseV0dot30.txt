---++ Gratia Collector/Reporting Conversion Procedures
This document describes a general guideline for implementing Gratia collector/reporting upgrades with the following goals:
   * minimize downtime as perceived by probes and report browsers
   * test all collector and reporting functions

There are 2 major components of the Gratia collector/reporting services that reside on the 2 separate processors:
   * Tomcat services - %CURRENT_TOMCAT% (aliased as gratia.opensciencegrid.org)
   * !MySql DBMS - %CURRENT_MYSQL% (aliased as gratia-db01.fnal.gov)

---+++ Basic steps
The basic premise for these guidelines is the availability of a duplicate set of processors and available storage which will allow for continued operation of the  production services while the conversion and testing is taking place.  The 2nd set of hosts will be updated from production.  Any conversions (software and dbms) are performed.  The upgraded system is then tested. Then, once the conversion and testing is complete, The replication feature of Gratia can then be utilized to bring the converted components up-to-date.  When this is complete, the aliases can be changed to point to the upgraded hosts.

The procedure below has specific references to the conversion of the current Gratia database schema's from !MyISAM to !InnoDB and also contains software upgrades to Gratia:
<ol>

<li>For the new !MySql DBMS:
<ol type="a">
<li>Configure a new !MySQL instance on %NEW_MYSQL% with the desired INNODB and default engine parameters.
<li>Shutdown the _ALL_ collectors on %CURRENT_TOMCAT% and allow all threads to complete any database updates including the replication services.
<li>Take a standard tree copy of the mysqldb tree on %CURRENT_MYSQL% and copy it to %NEW_MYSQL%
<li>On %NEW_MYSQL%, convert all tables to INNODB, timing the exercise.</li>
</ol>

<li>For the new Gratia Tomcat services:
<ol type="a">
<li>Install a new Gratia collector on %NEW_TOMCAT%.
<li>Connect the  new collector/reporter (%NEW_TOMCAT%) to the converted !MySql DB (%NEW_MYSQL%).</li>
</ol>

<li> Test the collector and reporting services on the new instances (%NEW_TOMCAT%, %NEW_MYSQL%) based on the details in the [[#Testing_the_conversion][Testing the conversion section of this document]].

<li>Announce a downtime for the production collector long enough to allow the completion of steps [[#StepNum05][5]] through [[#StepNum09][9]].</li>

<li>Set up a replication process from the production collector to the temporary collector, with DBID carefully set to only replicate records
received since DB copy (manual DB interaction).</li>

<li>Stop updates to the production DB and shut down the production collector after allowing replication to the temporary collector to complete.</li>

<li>Remove the replication (manual DB interaction).</li>

<li>Shut down the temporary collector after it has received the last replicated records from the production collector and take a note of the latest DBID (manual DB interaction) in the usage records on the temporary DB.</li>

<li>Upgrade the production collector.</li>

<li>Connect the production collector to the converted DB and bring it back up to receive data.</li>
</ol>
