---++ Gratia Collector/Reporting Conversion Procedures
This document describes a general guideline for implementing Gratia collector/reporting upgrades with the following goals:
   * minimize downtime
   * test all collector and reporting functions

There are 2 major components of the Gratia collector/reporting services that reside on the 2 separate processors:
   * Tomcat services - %CURRENT_TOMCAT% (aliased as gratia.opensciencegrid.org)
   * !MySql DBMS - gratia06 (aliased as gratia-db01.fnal.gov)

---+++ Basic steps
The basic premise for these guidelines is the availability of a duplicate set of processors which will allow for continued operation of the  production services while the conversion and testing is taking place.  The 2nd set of hosts will be updated from production.  Any conversions (software and dbms) are performed.  The upgraded system is then tested. Then, once the conversion and testing is complete, The replication feature of Gratia can then be utilized to bring the converted components up-to-date.  When this is complete, the aliases can be changed to pointed to the upgraded hosts.

<ol>
<li>Configure the !MySQL instance on =gratia07= with the desired INNODB and default engine parameters.
<li>Take a standard tree copy of the mysqldb tree to =gratia07= and convert all tables to INNODB, timing the exercise.</li>
<li>Connect a new (not production) collector to the converted DB in order to upgrade the schema without affecting the uptime of the production collector.</li>
<li>Announce a downtime for the production collector long enough to allow the completion of steps [[#StepNum05][5]] through [[#StepNum09][9]].</li>
<li>Set up a replication process from the production collector to the temporary collector, with DBID carefully set to only replicate records
received since DB copy (manual DB interaction).</li>
<li>Stop updates to the production DB and shut down the production collector after allowing replication to the temporary collector to complete.</li>
<li>Remove the replication (manual DB interaction).</li>
<li>Shut down the temporary collector after it has received the last replicated records from the production collector and take a note of the latest DBID (manual DB interaction) in the usage records on the temporary DB.</li>
<li>Upgrade the production collector.</li>
<li>Connect the production collector to the converted DB and bring it back up to receive data.</li>
</ol>

If I have covered all the bases correctly, this would allow us to upgrade the production collector to the latest version and to use INNODB with the minimum possible downtime as perceived by probes and report browsers.
