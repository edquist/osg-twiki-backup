---++Information of use for debugging issues.

In case a problem need to be investigate in detailed by the developer the following information can be of use:
   * Content of =$CATALINA_HOME/logs=
   * Content of =$CATALINA_HOME/gratia=
      * the sub-diretory $CATALINA_HOME/gratia/data contains information about the incoming data
         * =$CATALINA_HOME/gratia/data/thread?= contains the yet to be processed incoming message
         * =$CATALINA_HOME/gratia/data/old-*= contains a copy of all the already processed messages, including duplicates and error case
         * =$CATALINA_HOME/gratia/data/history-*= contains a marked up copy of all the successfully processed records.

---++Log Files

All the Collector and Reporting service log files are located in =$CATALINA_HOME/logs=. The main log files are as follows:

   * =catalina.out=: contains tomcat messages emitted outside the auspices of log4j (before its initialization for instance) or messages sent directly to =stdout=. This file is not rotated.
   * =messages.log=: contains all messages not otherwise directed by the log4j configuration file or Gratia's logging system (controlled by log4j config file).
   * =hibernate.log=: contains all messages emitted by hibernate (controlled by log4j config file).
   * =gratia.log=: Messages from the record processor code, including details of records saved,  errors found processing records any information about clean-up or replication.
   * =glite-security-trustmanager.log=: messages from the authorization infrastructure (controlled by the log4j config file).
   * =gratia-administration.log=: messages from the administration service.
   * =gratia-registration.log=: messages from registration activities.
   * =gratia-reporting.log=: All messages emitted by the Gratia reporting infrastructure (as opposed to BIRT messages, which appear in =catalina.out=).
   * =gratia-rmi-servlet.log=: messages from the servlets receiving information from remote probes.
   * =access/access.log=: tomcat access log (controlled by tomcat valve configuration in =conf/server.xml=).

Unless otherwise specified, logs are rotated daily and are controlled by the relevant clause in =service-configuration.properties=, the main Gratia configuration file.
