---+ INNODB Conversion Procedure, revision %REVINFO{"rev"}%

<ol>
#StepNum01  <li>Take a standard tree copy of the mysqldb tree and convert all tables to INNODB, timing the exercise. This is automatic, and will allow us to gauge how long a downtime is needed and whether the disk usage requirements are troublesome.</li>
#StepNum02  <li>Connect a new (not production) collector to the converted DB and measure the time required to upgrade the production schema. Again, this will allow us to gauge how long to allow for this procedure on the main collector.</li>
#StepNum03  <li>Announce a downtime for the production collector long enough to allow the completion of steps [[#StepNum05][5]] through [[#StepNum09][9]].</li>
#StepNum04  <li>Set up a replication process from the production collector to the temporary collector, with DBID carefully set to only replicate records
received since DB copy (manual DB interaction).</li>
#StepNum05  <li>Stop updates to the production DB and shut down the production collector after allowing replication to the temporary collector to complete.</li>
#StepNum06  <li>Remove the replication (manual DB interaction).</li>
#StepNum07  <li>Shut down the temporary collector after it has received the last replicated records from the production collector and take a note of the latest DBID (manual DB interaction) in the usage records on the temporary DB.</li>
#StepNum08  <li>Upgrade the production collector.</li>
#StepNum09  <li>Connect the production collector to the temporary DB and bring it back up to receive data.</li>
#StepNum10  <li>Convert the main DB to INNODB.</li>
#StepNum11  <li>Connect the temporary collector to the main DB to upgrade the schema.</li>
#StepNum12  <li>Announce a downtime for the production collector if desired (downtime should be a minute or less).</li>
#StepNum13  <li>Shut both collectors down.</li>
#StepNum14  <li>Bring both collectors back up, this time with the production collector connected to the main DB and the temporary collector connected to the copied DB.</li>
#StepNum15  <li>Set up replication from the temporary collector to the main collector to catch up on all the data that was sent to the production collector while it was connected to the temporary DB (manual DB interaction to set correct DBID from which to start replication).</li>
</ol>

If I have covered all the bases correctly, this would allow us to upgrade the production collector to the latest version and to use INNODB with the minimum possible downtime as perceived by probes and report browsers. The consequences are that there will be a temporary gap in reports from the production collector which will be missing data collected during steps [[#StepNum10][10]] through [[#StepNum13][13]] for as long as it takes to do step [[#StepNum15][15]].
