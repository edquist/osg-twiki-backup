---+ List of current enhancement and bug fixes requests
The list is ordered by priorities highest first.

   * Add the ability to retrieve the content of the Graphical Reports as a comma separated file (.csv).
   * Initial handshake from all probes to collector regardless of whether data are sent.
   * Tar and zip the backup files on the server
   * Evaluate condor probe with WS-GRAM and condor > 6.9.0.
   * Drill-down "live" area to include the graphical bar *and* the number, since a low volume site on the same graph as a high volume site has a very thin bar and hence a very small live area for drill-down.
   * When clicking on a VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo in the graph [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/index.jsp?link=viewer.jsp?__report=/data/glr/tomcat-gratia/webapps/gratia-reports/JobsByVO.rptdesign][Jobs By VO]] a graph by User is being displayer.  However instead of showing only the user of the VO, we see all the user.
   * Add a way to get a graph of the utlization per VirtualOrganizations/VOInfo of a specific site.
