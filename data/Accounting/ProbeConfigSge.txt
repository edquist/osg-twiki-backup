---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: SGE
<OL>
<LI />[[ProbeInstallation][Install]] the software using pacman or RPM.

#ProbeConfig<LI />Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &quot;generic&quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.<br />We recommend a =batchsystem:FQDN= such as "sge:fermigrid1.fnal.gov". |
| !SiteName = &quot;Generic Site&quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !VDTSetupFile = &quot;<tt>MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION</tt>/setup.sh&quot; |Path to the VDT =setup.sh= file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |
| !SGEAccountingFile = &quot;&quot; | This is the location of the SGE accounting file. If not set, the probe will look for =$SGE_ROOT/default/common/accounting=. |

<LI />The SGE Probe assumes a single SGE accounting file for processing records.

If the accounting file needs to be moved or rotated, you will need to make sure to do
the following:
<UL>
<LI />Disable the SGE Probe, if there is a chance it will run during the steps below.
<LI />Move or Rotate the accounting file.
<LI />Run sge.py against the old (moved) accounting file:
<pre>sge.py -c -a $ACCOUNTING_FILE</pre>
(Omit the =-c= if you do not use checkpointing. This will report all records to Gratia, instead of records after the last checkpoint).
<LI />Delete with checkpoint file (which resets the checkpoint)
<pre>rm MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/tmp/checkpoint</pre>
<LI />Continue running the SGE probe as before. It will now run against the new SGE accounting file.
</UL>


<LI />The pacman and RPM install procedures make appropriate entries in root's crontab
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time. This time is appropriately randomized.

<LI />The SOAPHost has been preconfigured to use the official OSG Gratia
collector (or the official ITB Gratia if you installed the ITB RPMs).
