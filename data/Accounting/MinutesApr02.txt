---++Attending
   * Main.PenelopeConstanta, Main.ChrisGreen, Steve Timm, John Urish, Main.JohnWeigand.
   * Apologies: Main.PhilippeCanal, Jeff Mack

---++Collector/Report development
   * Penelope
      * The code is now available to download a CSV file: collectors need to be updated.
      * I am investigating how to eliminate iframes, but it's looking really complicated and I'm running into technical problems; I need to do some more investigations.
      * I'm also looking into our own viewer code: one of our main problems is that our viewer code is often tailored to individual reports -- would like to separate this out if possible, as it is causing us many problems producing new reports and making general changes to all reports.
   * Chris
      * Stored procedure additions for Jeff have been checked in but require further testing; they necessitated a column addition to the VOProbeSummary table.
      * There was an email on the list recently suggesting the use of views in place of summary tables and triggers.
         * John W: you'd still be searching across the whole table -- views save SQL, not time.
      * There was another email on the list talking about "forcing" a particular index to be used as the MySQL parser often makes a non-optimal choice of index to use if it has several from which to choose.
         * Penelope: I'd like to see a test with one query forced, and then again with MySQL left to make the choice.
   * Penelope: memory resident tables for access speed?
      * Chris: doesn't sound scalable, even with table surgery (splitting off XML columns to a different table).
   * John W: do we need reports to be timely at all? Can we not just update summary tables once per day?

---++Probes
   * Chris: problems reported with SGE probe: updates from authors in repository and awaiting testing of Gratia.py before 
---++Storage Probe
   * No news this week.
