We current provide a simple python library (Gratia.py) for the implementation of the Gratia Probe.

---++ Minimal example

The following script is a minimal example, showing the steps need to upload a record:

<verbatim>#Load the library
import Gratia.py
# Initialize the Gratia library (read the Probe configuration file)
Gratia.Initialize()
# Create the record
# The parameter indicates the Resource Type ("Batch", "RawCPU", "Storage",etc)
# See also the function ResourceType
r = Gratia.UsageRecord("Batch")
r.LocalUserId("cmsuser000")
# Send it
r.Send()</verbatim>

See [[%ATTACHURL%/samplemeter.py.txt][samplemeter.py.txt]] for a complete example.

---++ Gratia.Send

Generate the XML file corresponding to the usage record and upload it to the server.
The return value is an empty string in case of success.  In case of failure, the error
message is returned.  Usually the error are non fatal in the sense that the xml file
will be cached and re-send the next time the probe is ran.

In the rare case where Gratia is *both* unable to store the file locally and unable to upload it to the
server the message will start with =Fatal Error:=, for example:

=Fatal Error: Record not send and not cached.  Record will be lost.=

=Fatal Error: too many pending files=

is issued and the record will need to be recreated by the probe once either the
write error or the communication error has been resolved (see log file for
details on the error).

---++ Gratia.Handshake

The Probe and Collector exchange a handshake message when Gratia.Initialize is called.   
This allows to differentiate between a Probe with no data to report and a probe with a 
broken configuration. 

The Handshake can also be called explicitly:

   Gratia.Handshake() 

This is in particular recommended for Probe that are implemented as a daemon.
Those probes should call Gratia.Handshake() regularly (especially if there is no real data to upload).  The call to Handshake will also re-establish the connection
if it was previously broken or it has timed-out.  If 'True' is passed as a parameter ( Gratia.Handshake(True) ), the number of connection retries will be reset
(effectively forcing a connection attempt even if many previous attempt failed)

Probe should call: 
<verbatim>  Gratia.RegisterReporterLibrary(name,version)</verbatim>
to register the libraries the Probe itself is using.
<verbatim>  Gratia.RegisterReporter(name,version)</verbatim>
to register the version of the Probe itself
<verbatim>  Gratia.RegisterService(name,version)</verbatim>
to register the version of the service (Condor,
PBS,LSF,DCache,SunGrid Engine, etc.) being 'probed'

Those function must be called before the call to Gratia.Initialize.

#DataType
---++ Data type 

When expecting a time instant (i.e. a date and time), the Gratia interface expects either a number of second since epoch or
a string formated using the format [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime][xsd:dateTime]].

The function Gratia.TimeToString takes a python struct_time object and convert it
to a string following the format [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime][xsd:dateTime]].

When expecting a time duration, the Gratia interface expects a number in second and fraction of second or 
a string formated using the format [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#duration][xsd:duration]]

---++ Public Interface:
In general the function correspond to the equivalent XML tag described in the [[http://www.psc.edu/~lfm/PSC/Grid/UR-WG/UR-Spec-gfd.58-ggf18.pdf][OGF Usage Record XML Schema]].  Only 2 of StartTime, EndTime and WallDuration are required.
---+++ !StartTime(self, value, description = "")
Time instant at which the 'usage' started.  See [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax for 'value'.
The argument can be either a string (with the correct formating) or a struct_time python object
---+++ !EndTime(self, value, description = "")
Time instant at which the 'usage' ended.  See [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax for 'value'
The argument can be either a string (with the correct formating) or a struct_time python object
---+++ !WallDuration(self, value, description = "")
Wall clock time that elapsed while the job was running. 
<verbatim>r.WallDuration(3600*25+63*60+21.2)</verbatim>
See [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax for 'value'
---+++ !CpuDuration(self, value, cputype, description = ""):
Total amount of cpu time used by the job.   Cputype must be specified and be one of either 'user' or 'system'
<verbatim>        r.CpuDuration("PT23H12M1.75S","user")
        r.CpuDuration("PT12M1.75S","sys")</verbatim>
See [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax for 'value'
---+++ !UserKeyInfo(self,value)
Expect the complete DN.  The currently supported format look like:

=/DC=gov/DC=fnal/O=Fermilab/OU=Robots/CN=cdf/CN=Elliot D. Lipeles/USERID=lipeles=

=CN=john ainsworth, L=MC, OU=Manchester, O=eScience, C=UK=

---+++ !Status(self,value, description = "")
The value is represented as a string

This property will represent the completion status of the job. For example, this may
represent the exit status of an interactive running process or the exit status from the batch
queuing system&#8217;s accounting record. The semantic meaning of status is site dependent.

Numerical value are supported as well as the following 'words'
 * aborted &#8211; A policy or human intervention caused the job to cease execution.
 * completed &#8211; The execution completed.
 * failed &#8211; Execution halted without external intervention.
 * held &#8211; Execution is held at the time this usage record was generated.
 * queued &#8211; Execution was queued at the time this usage record was generated.
 * started &#8211; Execution started at the time this usage record was generated.
 * suspended &#8211; Execution was suspended at the time this usage record was generated.
---+++ !LocalUserId(self,value)
The local identity of the user associated with the resource consumption reported in this
Usage Record. This user is often referred to as the requesting user. For example, the
value may be the user&#8217;s login name corresponding to the user&#8217;s uid in the /etc/passwd file
on Unix systems.
---+++ !LocalJobId (self,value)
The local job identifier as assigned by the batch queue expressed as a string.
---+++ !GlobalJobId(self,value)
The global job identifier as assigned by a metascheduler or federation scheduler.
---+++ !ProcessId(self,value)
The (OS level) process id of the jobs (PID).
---+++ !GlobalUsername(self,value)
The global identity of the user associated with the resource consumption reported in this
Usage Record.  For example, the value may be the distinguished name from the user&#8217;s
certificate.
---+++ !JobName(self, value, description = "")
The job or application name. For example, this could be the name of the executable that
ran, or the name of the batch queuing system&#8217;s name for the job.
---+++ !Charge(self,value, unit = "", formula = "", description = "")
This property represents the total charge of the job in the system&#8217;s allocation unit. For
example 100, 200, or 3000. The meaning of this charge will be site dependent. The value
for this property MAY include premiums or discounts assessed on the actual usage
represented within this record. Therefore, the reported charge might not be directly
reconstructable from the specific usage reported.

Note that &#8220;Charge&#8221; does not necessarily refer to a currency-based unit unless that is what
members of the grid virtual organization agree to as the definition. If charge denotes a
value in currency, standard currency codes should be used to indicate the currency unit
being reported.
---+++ !TimeDuration(self, value, timetype, description = ""):
Additional measure of time duration that is relevant to the reported usage.  timetype can be one of 'submit','connect','dedicated' (or other).

See [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax for 'value'
---+++ !TimeInstant(self, value, timetype, description = ""):
Additional identified discrete time that is relevant to the reported usage.
timetype can be one of 'submit','connect' (or other)

See [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax for 'value'
---+++ !MachineName(self, value, description = "") 
Should be the fully qualified name of the CE/SE.
---+++ !Host(self, value, primary = False, description = "") 
Hostname where the job was actually run.
In the description you can/should add a description of the node itself.  For example:

    si2k=7363.23 'model='Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 2.40GHz' ncpu=4

where si2k is optional and would contain the result of running the Spec Int 2000 test
on that node.

accounting systems define this is the ACID. On some systems, the project is identified
with the effective GID under which the job consumed resources.
[This is currently stored but not used by Gratia.
---+++ !Network(self, value, storageUnit = "", phaseUnit = "", metric = "total", description = "") :
The amount of network resource used by the job.

Metric should be one of 'total','average','max','min'
value should be an integer. 
PhaseUnit should expressed as a duration; see [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax.
---+++ !Disk(self, value, storageUnit = "", phaseUnit = "", type = "", metric = "total", description = "") :

This property specifies the swap usage

Metric should be one of 'total','average','max','min'.  Type can be one of shared, physical, dedicated.

phaseUnit should expressed as a duration; see [[#DataType][Data Type]] for details on the syntax.
---+++ !NodeCount(self, value, metric = "total", description = "") :
Number of nodes used. A node definition may be dependent on the architecture, but
typically a node is a physical machine. For example a cluster of 16 physical machines
with each machine having one processor each is a 16 &#8220;node&#8221; machine, each with one
&#8220;processor&#8221;. A 16 processor SMP machine however, is 1 physical node (machine) with
16 processors.

Metric should be one of 'total','average','max','min' 
---+++ !Processors(self, value, consumptionRate = 0, metric = "total", description = "") :

CPUs used. For example, if a job uses two cluster &#8220;nodes&#8221;, each node having 16 CPUs
each, the total number of processors would be 32.

Metric should be one of 'total','average','max','min'
consumptionRate specifies te consumption rate for the report processor usage.  The cinsumption rate is a sclaing factor that indicates the average percentage of utilization.
