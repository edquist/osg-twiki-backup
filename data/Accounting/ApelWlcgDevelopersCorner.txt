---+ Developers Corner
This section attempts to describe the scripts and configuration files used by this interface.

---+ Scripts
---++ LCG.py
This is the main interface program performing the following functions: 

 1. Retrieves the accounting data from the Gratia database for selected OSG sites and VOs for a month. Sites are defined in a file identified by the 'SiteFilterFile' attribute of the lcg.conf file. VOs are defined in a file identified by the 'VOFilterFile' attribute of the lcg.conf file
With the change implemented on 6/19/07 providing for individual normalization factor by site, instead of a single query being used to retrieve the gratia data, individual queries by site are performed.  In order to reduce the verbage in the log file, only the first query is output to the log file.  The site and normalization factor used is displayed for the other site queries.

2. Formats SQL DML INSERT statements to update the OSG_DATA table of the APEL/WLCG database. The table name is defined by the 'LcgTable' attribute of the lcg-db.conf file.  For testing purposes a clone table called OSG_TABLE_TEST can be set instead. The SQL DML statements for the last run are placed in a directory defined by the 'LogSqlDir' attribute of the lcg.conf file. The file name is YYYY-MM.sql and contains only the DML from the last update run. 

 3. Updates the APEL/CLG database. In order to handle site and VO name changes, the SQL DML is set up to DELETE all data for the month/year and then INSERT the new data. This is a simple approach to handling these kinds of changes and works as of 4/25/2007.  It may be this will not hold up over the long run and will have to be re-visited.

Additional functionality:

  1. The script has been design to do everything EXCEPT update the APEL database unless the --update option is used.  This prevents accidental running of the script especially when testing.

  2. Log files are created in the directory specified by the 'LogSqlDir' attribute of the lcg.conf file. The format of the log files is YYYY-MM.log.

  3. A file containing the latest SQL DML statements used to update the APEL database is created in the same directory as the log files. The format of the sql file is YYYY-MM.sql

  4. The script will, after completing the APEL database update, create  xml and html files of the data contained in the APEL database table. This was added on 4/17/08 to provide visibility into the data being sent.  No functionality is contained in this script to use these files.  This just makes them available.



Usage:
<blockquote><pre>
  LCG.py(lcg.sh)  --conf=config_file --date=month [--update] [--no-email]

     --conf - specifies the main configuration file to be used
              which would be the lcg.conf file normally

     --date - specifies the monthly time period to be updated:
              Valid values:
                current  - the current month
                previous - the previous month
                YYYY/MM  - any year and month

              The 'current' and 'previous' values are to facillitate running
              this as a cron script.  Generally, we will run a cron
              entry for the 'previous' month for n days into the current
              month in order to insure all reporting has been completed.

     The following 2 options are to facillitate testing and to avoid
     accidental running and updating of the APEL/WLCG database and are
     therefore considered optional:

     --update - this option says to go ahead and update the APEL/WLCG database.
                If this option is NOT specified, then everything is executed
                EXCEPT the actual updating of the database.  The SQL DML
                file used to update the database will be created.

     --no-email - this option says to turnoff the sending of email
                notifications on failures and successful completions.

---++ !DownTimes.py
Class used to query !MyOSG for planned downtimes for a site/resource.

---++ !InactiveResources.py
Class used to query !MyOSG for sites/resources that have been marked as <I>inactive</i>.


---++ lcg.sh
This shell script is used to execute the LCG.py process.  The primary purpose of this shell script is to get access to a !MySql client. The !MySql being used comes from Fermi UPS.  It assumes UPS is available via /fnal/ups/etc/setups.sh. There is no command line argument to override this.  All other command line arguments are passed directly to the LCG.py script which collects the data from the gratia database and updates the APEL database. <br /> <br />This script will log error messages to stdout. So it is important you do not redirect stdout/err in the cron entry.  This will insure that someone gets an email notification if a failure occurs. <br /> <br />It is also important that you 'cd' to the lcg.sh parent directory if you specify relative paths for the various files in the lcg.conf file.

---++ find-late-updates.sh
Shell script used to show sites/resource that have updated Gratia for the previous month during the current month.  This output of this is visible in the table column <i>late updates</i> here: http://gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org/gratia-data/interfaces/apel-lcg/

---++ create-apel-index.sh
Shell script that creates the index.html for: http://gratia-osg-prod.opensciencegrid.org/gratia-data/interfaces/apel-lcg/ <br />This is based on certain files in the log directory specified by the <i>LogSqlDir</i> attribute in the <i>lcg.conf</i> file.

---+ Configuration files
---++ Configuration (lcg.conf)
The <i>lcg.conf</i> is the main configuration file used by the interface.

%EDITTABLE{   format="| text, 25 | textarea, 4x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }% 
| *File* | *Description* |
| !GratiaCollector | Data directory for Gratia collector. <br />   * /data/tomcat-gratia/webapps/gratia-data/interfaces/apel-lcg <br />The xml and html files are made accessible via this collector (uses an scp format). If you do not want the files copied to a collector, then use the keyword 'DO_NOT_COPY'. <br /> |
| [[#SiteFilterFile_lcg_reportableSit][SiteFilterFile]] | File with list of sites/resources to be reported and the normalization factor. |
| [[#SiteFilterHistory_lcg_reportable][SiteFilterHistory]] | History directory for keeping previous periods (months)!SiteFilterFile's (<NAME>.YYYYMM) <br /> |
| [[#VOFilterFile_lcg_reportableVOs][VOFilterFile]] | File with list of VOs to be reported |
| [[#DBConfFile_lcg_db_conf][DBConfFile]] | Configuration file for databases |
| !LogSqlDir | Directory for log files and the sql dml update file. |
| !MissingDataDays | Number of days where a site/resource has no data reported to Gratia for the month.  If more than this number of days, a warning/advisory email will be generated. |
| !FromEmail | Email address of the sender.  Since this is a cron run process, this is dependent on how email is set up locally. |
| !ToEmail | List of comma separated email addresses.  Email notifications are sent to this list for all executions of this interface for both success and failure. |


---++ !SiteFilterFile (lcg-reportableSites)
This file identifies the set of sites/resources reportable to the APEL-LCG database and the normalization factor to be used in the gratia query.
   * token 1 - The !SiteName/Resource name as reported in Gratia.
   * token 2 - The normalization value to be used. This was obtained from site surveys regarding the hardware used on a site's clusters and is an estimated value based on a SPECint2000 specification.  If no value is specified, then a value is derived from the  gratia database using the gratia_psacct.!ProbeName specified in lcg.conf file.
      * These tokens are whitespace separated.   
      * Comments - line starting with a # sign 
      * Empty lines are permitted.

Example:
<blockquote><pre>

<b>Note: In the future, the need for this configuration file should be eliminated.  It would be replaced by a query of !MyOSG using the WLCG Accounting data for the Resource/Site.</b>
---++ !SiteFilterHistory (lcg-reportableSites.history files)
This directory (lcg-reportableSites.history) contains the lcg-reportableSites files for each month (format: lcg-reportableSites/lcg-reportableSites.YYYYMM.  

Since the normalization factor changes over time, the only means of recreating past months data is to make this data time sensitive.  The interface program is designed to update the file for the current month every time it is run.  This provides the history for the latest normalization factor used.

When re-running a "past" (not current), the interface uses the time-stamped file for the respective month.  When updates are made, the file should be commited into CVS.

---++ !VOFilterFile (lcg-reportableVOs)
This file identifies the VO data reported for each reportable site/resource.  
Example:
<blockquote><pre>
cms
uscms
atlas
usatlas
alice
</pre></blockquote>

---++ !DBConfFile (lcg-db.conf)
Identifies access information for the Gratia and APEL databases.

%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF"}% 
%EDITTABLE{   format="| text, 25 | textarea, 2x50 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }% 
| *File* | *Description* |
| !GratiaHost | Gratia database host |
| !GratiaPort | Gratia database port |
| !GratiaUser | Gratia user (should always be a read only) |
| !GratiaPswd | File containing the !GratiaUser password. Permissions should be set to read only by the owner.) |
| !GratiaDB | Gratia database (schema) |
| | |
| !LcgHost | APEL database host |
| !LcgPort | APEL database port |
| !LcgUser | APEL database user ("OSG" for both production and test) |
| !LcgPswd | File containing the !LcgUser password. Permissions should be set to read only by the owner.) |
| !LcgDB | APEL database/schema ("accounting" for both production and test) |
| !LcgTable | APEL data base table for Site-Resource summary data <br />   * production (OSG_DATA) <br />   * test (OSG_DATA_TEST) |
| !LcgUserTable | APEL data base table for Site-Resource/DN summary data <br />   * production (OSG_CN_DATA) <br />   * test (OSG_CN_DATA_TEST) |

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> !MySql access permissions for the APEL accounting database is based on the node running this interface.  Currently, access is being granted from gr8x0, gratia02 and gratia03 nodes at fnal.gov.  In addition to the 4 tables updated (OSG_DATA, OSG_DATA_TEST, OSG_CN_DATA, OSG_CN_DATA_TEST), this interface needs "read-only" access to the following 2 tables:
   * org_Tier1
   * org_Tier2

---+ Crontab
As mentioned somewhere way back in this document, the general practice has been run this interface from the 1st of the current month thru the 8th of the next month (e.g. for November, it will run nightly from 11/1 thru 12/8) to accommodate sites/resources that may have had reporting problems and are in "catch-up" mode.  So 2 cron entries are required:
<blockquote><pre>
##########################################################################
# Gratia-to-APEL (WLCG) transfer crontab entry
#
# Note: When scheduling the time of these scripts, you should first
#       check with the root cron's database backup to insure there
#       is not a conflict.
#       This script also must be run on the same host as the
#       tomcat-gratia collector as it copies files into its
#       ./webapps/gratia-data/interfaces/apel-lcg directory.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Previous month's transfers
# For just the 1st n days of the month to insure all have reported
#
15 0 1-8 * *   dir=/home/gratia/interfaces/apel-lcg; cd $dir; ./lcg.sh --config=lcg.conf --date=previous --update;
                     ./create-apel-index.sh /data/tomcat-gratia
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Current month's transfers.
# Always daily.
#
15 1 * * *   dir=/home/gratia/interfaces/apel-lcg; cd $dir; ./lcg.sh --config=lcg.conf --date=current --update;
                ./find-late-updates.sh /data/tomcat-gratia; ./create-apel-index.sh /data/tomcat-gratia
