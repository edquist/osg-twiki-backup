With the change implemented on 6/19/07 providing for individual normalization factor by site, instead of a single query being used to retrieve the Gratia data, individual queries by site are performed.  In order to reduce the verbage in the log file, only the first query is output to the log file.  The site and normalization factor used is displayed for the other site queries.

2. Formats the SSM message sent to APEL to update  APEL/WLCG database. The %LCG_DB_CONF% file defines  For testing purposes a clone table called OSG_TABLE_TEST can be set instead. The SQL DML statements for the last run are placed in a directory defined by the 'LogSqlDir' attribute of the lcg.conf file. The file name is YYYY-MM.sql and contains only the DML from the last update run. 

 3. Updates the APEL/CLG database. In order to handle site and VO name changes, the SQL DML is set up to DELETE all data for the month/year and then INSERT the new data. This is a simple approach to handling these kinds of changes and works as of 4/25/2007.  It may be this will not hold up over the long run and will have to be re-visited.

Additional functionality:

  1. The script has been design to do everything EXCEPT update the APEL database unless the --update option is used.  This prevents accidental running of the script especially when testing.

  2. Log files are created in the directory specified by the 'LogSqlDir' attribute of the lcg.conf file. The format of the log files is YYYY-MM.log.

  3. A file containing the latest SQL DML statements used to update the APEL database is created in the same directory as the log files. The format of the sql file is YYYY-MM.sql

  4. The script will, after completing the APEL database update, create  xml and html files of the data contained in the APEL database table. This was added on 4/17/08 to provide visibility into the data being sent.  No functionality is contained in this script to use these files.  This just makes them available.

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT% showlink="Show usage"}%
<blockquote><pre>
  LCG.py   --conf=config_file --date=month [--update] [--no-email]

     --conf - specifies the main configuration file to be used
              which would normally be the lcg.conf file

     --date - specifies the monthly time period to be updated:
              Valid values:
                current  - the current month
                previous - the previous month
                YYYY/MM  - any year and month

              The 'current' and 'previous' values are to facillitate running
              this as a cron script.  Generally, we will run a cron
              entry for the 'previous' month for n days into the current
              month in order to insure all reporting has been completed.

     The following 2 options are to facillitate testing and to avoid
     accidental running and sending of the SSM message to APEL and are
     therefore considered optional:

     --update - this option says to go ahead and update the APEL/WLCG database.
                If this option is NOT specified, then everything is executed
                EXCEPT the actual sending of the SSM message to APEL.
                The message file will be created.

     --no-email - this option says to turnoff the sending of email
                notifications on failures and successful completions.

---++ !DownTimes.py
Class used to query !MyOSG for planned downtimes for a site/resource.

The LCG.py module does a check for __resource groups__ that have not reported any data to Gratia for each day in the month and will report this in a warning email so corrective action can be initiated.  In order to avoid a "false" reporting of this in the event this was a planned/scheduled shutdown, this module retrieves all downtime data from !MyOSG using the following criteria:
<blockquote><pre>
Information to display: Downtime Information
Show Past Downtime for: All
         The reason for requesting "All" is that it is based on End Time
         in which case the "past.." ones will not show resource groups
         currently down.
Resource Groups to display: All Resource Groups
For Resource Group: Grid type OSG
For Resource: Provides following Services - Grid Service/CE

---++ !Rebus.py
This class retrieves the latest WLCG Rebus topology csv file and provides various methods for viewing/using the data by executing:
   * wget http://wlcg-rebus.cern.ch/apps/topology/all/csv
It is important to understand that in the WLCG Rebus topology __site__ is equivalent to !MyOsg __resource_group__.

The rationale for using this class in the interface is to insure that the OSG and Rebus are in sync in terms of 
which  OSG __resource_groups__ should be reported.  If a WLCG site (OSG __resource_group__ ) registers with WLCG and 
OSG does not indicate it should be interface (and visa versa), then we to take action.

Additionally, this module can be executed from the command line to more easily view the topology.%BR%

This module is currently __NOT__ used in the APEL/WLCG interface.  It could be at some point in the future, however.  At this point in time (Aug 2011), there does not exist a reliable means of determining this value agreeable to all.  It was written to aid in the viewing of the currently

This directory (lcg-reportableSites.history) contains the lcg-reportableSites files for each month (format: lcg-reportableSites/lcg-reportableSites.YYYYMM.  

Since the normalization factor changes over time, the only means of recreating past months data is to make this data time sensitive.  The interface program is designed to update the file for the current month every time it is run.  This provides the history for the latest normalization factor used.

When re-running a "past" (not current), the interface uses the time-stamped file for the respective month.  When updates are made, the file should be commited into CVS.

---+ Crontab
The crontab file can be found in %CRONTAB_LOCATION%.

As mentioned somewhere way back in this document, the general practice has been run this interface from the 1st of the current month thru the 8th of the next month (e.g. for November, it will run nightly from 11/1 thru 12/8) to accommodate sites/resources that may have had reporting problems and are in "catch-up" mode.  So 2 cron entries are required:

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT% showlink="Show an example /etc/cron.d/gratia-apel.cron"}%
<blockquote><pre>
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Gratia/APEL-EGI interface crontab entry
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Previous month's transfers are run for just the 1st n days of the month to 
# insure all sites have reported to Gratia. 
# The n days is dependent on when LCG accounting issues the monthly MOU reports
#
# Note the lock file not existing is success hence the the slightly odd logic
# below.
#
# The lock file can be enabled or disabled via a
#   service   gratia-apel-cron start
#   chkconfig gratia-apel-cron on
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
15 0 1-8 * *  root   [ ! -f /var/lock/subsys/gratia-apel-cron ] || (/usr/share/gratia-apel/LCG.py --config=/etc/gratia-apel/lcg.conf --date=previous --update)
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Current month's transfers - Always daily.

---+ Output Data Files


---+ SSM
Effective June 2012, accounting data sent to the EGI/WLCG APEL accounting system using the Secure Stomp Messanger (SSM).

The Secure Stomp Messenger (SSM) is designed to give a reliable message transfer mechanism using the STOMP protocol.  Messages are encrypted 
during transit, and are sent sequentially, the next message being sent only when the previous one has been acknowledged.
The SSM is written in python.  It is designed and packaged for SL5. 

Additional information about APEL can be found here:
   * [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/APEL][APEL - General Description]]
   * [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/APEL/Server][APEL/Server]]
   * [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/APEL/SSM][APEL/SSM interface]]


---++ SSM Installation
The SSM software is distributed as a part of the gratia-apel rpm package.  This is done to insure compatibility between the 2 systems.  If not, independent updates of SSM may not be compatible with the Gratia-APEL interface.

These sections provide a little more detail obtained from the [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/APEL/SSMInstallation][APELs SSM Installation twiki]] related to the configuration.

---+++ Prerequistes
The SSM protocal uses SSI authentication and therefore requires a set of CA certificates and a service certificate.  
   * Instructions for installing the CA certificates: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/InstallCertAuth][OSG - Installing Certificate Authorities Certificates and related RPMs twiki]].
   * Instructions for obtaining a service certificate: [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/GetHostServiceCertificates][OSG - How to get host service certificates]]

%TWISTY{%TWISTY_OPTS_OUTPUT% showlink="Show an example CA certificates install"}%
This is a sample install of the CA certificates:
<blockquote><pre>
&gt; rpm -Uvh http://repo.grid.iu.edu/osg-el5-release-latest.rpm  # OSG repo
&gt; rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm   # EPEL repo
&gt; yum  -y  install yum-priorities
&gt; yum  -y  install osg-ca-certs
&gt; yum  -y  install fetch-crl

## Insure the cron will be activated
&gt; chkconfig fetch-crl-cron on
&gt; /sbin/service fetch-crl-cron start

## fetch-crl must have run once for the certificates to be verified successfully
&gt; /sbin/service fetch-crl-boot start    # this will take a little while
</pre></blockquote>
%ENDTWISTY%

In addition, there are several python libraries required:
<blockquote><pre>
&gt; yum  -y  install stomppy   
&gt; yum  -y  install python-daemon
&gt; yum  -y  install python-ldap
</pre></blockquote>

---+++ Install SSM
The installation from RPM is:
<blockquote><pre>
&gt; rpm -iv /cloud/login/weigand/osg-rpm-install/SSM/etc/ssm-0.11-1.noarch.rpm
</pre></blockquote>

The RPM carries out a number of steps to run the SSM in a specific way.
   * It installs the core files in __/opt/apel/ssm__
   * It creates the messages directory __/var/opt/apel/messages__
   * It creates the log directory __/var/log/apel__
   * It creates the pidfile directory __/var/run/apel__



---++ SSM Configuration files
There are 2 configuration files in __/opt/apel/ssm/conf__ that require some modifications:
   * ssm.cfg
   * ssm.log.cfg

These sections define the specific changes made for this interface.%BR%
More detail regarding other options can be found in the [[https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/APEL/SSMConfiguration][APEL/SSM Configuration twiki]]

---+++ ssm.cfg
The table below indicates the changes necessary for test and production:
%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF"}% 
| Test            | [broker]        | broker-network: TEST-NWOB%BR%username: gratia |
|                   | [certificates]  | certificate: /etc/grid-security/gratia-osg-prod-reports.opensciencegrid.org-hostcert.pem%BR%key: /etc/grid-security/gratia-osg-prod-reports.opensciencegrid.org-hostkey.pem |
|                   | [producer]     |  /C=UK/O=eScience/OU=CLRC/L=RAL/CN=raptest.esc.rl.ac.uk/emailAddress=sct-certificates@stfc.ac.uk |
| Production | [broker]         | broker-network: PROD%BR%username: gratia |
|                   | [certificates]  | certificate: /etc/grid-security/gratia-osg-prod-reports.opensciencegrid.org-hostcert.pem%BR%key: /etc/grid-security/gratia-osg-prod-reports.opensciencegrid.org-hostkey.pem |
|                   | [producer]     | consumer-dn: /C=UK/O=eScience/OU=CLRC/L=RAL/CN=rap.esc.rl.ac.uk |


---+++ ssm.log.cfg
The only change required in the interface logging configuration is to hard code the directory path to the log directory and file:
%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF"}% 
| [handler]        | args=('/var/log/apel/ssm.log', 'a') |

---++ Running the SSM
The SSM needs to be run once without sending any messages in order to create the necessary
directory structure in __/var/opt/apel/messages__:
<blockquote><pre>
drwxr-xr-x 2 gratia gratia 4096 Jul 23 13:36 accept
drwxr-xr-x 2 gratia gratia 4096 Jul 23 13:36 ack
drwxr-xr-x 2 gratia gratia 4096 Jul 23 13:36 incoming
drwxr-xr-x 2 gratia gratia 4096 Jul 23 13:37 outgoing
drwxr-xr-x 2 gratia gratia 4096 Jul 23 13:36 reject
</pre></blockquote>

To run the SSM the first time (but don't do this until you've completed the configuration for test or production):
<blockquote><pre>
&gt; export SSM_HOME=/opt/apel/ssm
&gt; $SSM_HOME/bin/run-ssm
</pre></blockquote>

Then, to send your messages:
   * Write all the messages to the /opt/apel/ssm/messages/outgoing directory
   * export SSM_HOME=/opt/apel/ssm
   * $SSM_HOME/bin/run-ssm


---++ Log file (/var/log/apel/ssm.log)
The APEL/SSM log file for a successful run will look like this:
