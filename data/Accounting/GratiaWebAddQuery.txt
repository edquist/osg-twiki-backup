---+ Guide to create a new Query in Gratia Web 
The Gratia Web queries are defined in !XML files. These files are located at in the =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= project in this path =./src/gratia/config=. If you are working in a machine with a working installation these files will be located in the =site-packages= folder of the python installation in the machine. For example in a SL5 machine with python 2.4 the path would be =/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/gratia/config=, or in a SL6 machine with python 2.6 it would be =/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/gratia/config=.
