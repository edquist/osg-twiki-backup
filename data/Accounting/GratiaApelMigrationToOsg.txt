---+!! Gratia-APEL Migration To OSG

%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%


---+ Final test of installation

1. On your node,
   a.   make a run against the test APEL.
        Advise when you are doing this and I will make a run against the
        test APEL on my node

   b. Then we compare can compare results.
        Verifying  http://fermicloud108.fnal.gov:8319/gratia-apel/
              and  http://OSG_TEST_NODE:8319/gratia-apel


---+ Changeover for Production

1. On my node,
   a. need to make a run of the SSM piece to send the latest
      delete file up.  This will zero out all the Gratia data for June.
      This insures we don't miss one due to a timing issue of the runs.

2. Then on your node,
   a. modify the /etc/gratia-apel/ssm/ssm.conf to point to production

   a. would suggest that you modify the cron entry adding a --no-email
      argument.  This insures we don't send false alarms out if there is
      a problem.

   c. run the interface

   d. reset the cron entry removing the --no-email argument

3. On your side,
   a. Change the url alias for gratia-apel-wlcg.opensciencegrid.org
      from gr13x6.fnal.gov   to OSG_NODE

   b. Verify  http://gratia-apel-wlcg.opensciencegrid.org:8319/gratia-apel/%BR%
         and  http://OSG_NODE:8319/gratia-apel
      are identical

4. Verify  http://gratia-apel-wlcg.opensciencegrid.org:8319/gratia-apel/%BR%
      and  http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/wlcg_reporting?year=2014&month=6
   show the same data.

5. In a day or 2, verify we are close on%BR%
           http://gratiaweb.grid.iu.edu/gratia/jot_reporting%BR%
       and http://accounting.egi.eu/tier2.php?SubTier2=1.35&query=njobs&startYear=2014&startMonth=6&endYear=2014&endMonth=6&yRange=TIER2&xRange=DATE&voGroup=lhc&chart=GRBAR&scale=LIN&localJobs=onlygridjobs%BR%
   .. at the bottom of the EGI page there is a data of last update which
      tells us what data may be there.
