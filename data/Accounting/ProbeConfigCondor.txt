---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: Condor
<ol>
<li>[[ProbeInstallation][Install]] the software using pacman or RPM.

<ul><li>%RED%NOTE%ENDCOLOR% Because of the complicated nature of the interaction between the jobmanagers and probe, the assumption is made that Gratia is installed directly into =$VDT_LOCATION=. If this is not the case, then you should link the gratia directory into =$VDT_LOCATION=: it is assumed by the jobmanager that interim Gratia data files it produces go in to =$VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/data=, and the entry for =DataFolder= in the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file should reflect that fact.</li>
</ul>
</li>

#ProbeConfig<li>Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values (See [[ProbeConfig]] for more details):

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &quot;generic&quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.<br />We recommend a =batchsystem:FQDN= such as "condor:fermigrid1.fnal.gov". |
| !SiteName = &quot;Generic Site&quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !VDTSetupFile = &quot;<tt>MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION</vdt>/setup.sh&quot; |Path to the VDT =setup.sh= file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |
| !UserVOMapFile = &quot;<tt>MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION<tt>/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt&quot; |Path to the VDT =osg-user-vo-map.txt= (or =grid3-user-vo-map.txt=) file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |
| !EnableProbe = &quot;1&quot; | If present, this attribute must be set to one to enable probe reporting. |
</li>

<li>The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in =/etc/cron.d=
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time; this time is randomized.</li>

#GratiaCondorGramPatch<li>Under the directory =gratia/condor-probes/gram_mods= there are two
files that contain some required changes to the GRAM jobmanager scripts. These patches change =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/condor.pm= and =$VDT_LOCATION/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager/managedfork.pm=

The RPM installation will attempt to check for these patches if installed under =$VDT_LOCATION=: if they are not found you will be warned.

<ol>
#GratiaCondorGramPatchPacman<li>VDT-1.3.10 (part of OSG 0.4.1) has a pacman patch Gratia-Patch(install with pacman -get Gratia-Patch); OR: </li>

#GratiaCondorGramPatchManual<li>You may apply the patches yourself:

<verbatim>
cd $VDT_LOCATION/globus/lib/perl/Globus/GRAM/JobManager
patch --verbose -p0 < <gratia-dir>/probe/condor/gram_mods/condor.pm.diff
patch --verbose -p0 < <gratia-dir>/probe/condor/gram_mods/managedfork.pm.diff
</verbatim>

If these commands fail it is likely to be because either the version of VDT you have or a previous RPM install has already applied the patches.
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>The SOAPHost has been pre-configured to use the official OSG Gratia
collector (or the official ITB Gratia if you installed the ITB RPMs); please verify this configuration before enabling the probe.</li>

</ol>
