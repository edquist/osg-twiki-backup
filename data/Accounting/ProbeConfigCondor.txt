---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: Condor
<OL>
<LI>[[ProbeInstallation#DownloadTable][Install]] the software
<LI>Install a specific probe such as [[ProbeInstallation#ProbeDownloadCondor][gratia-probe-condor]] or
[[ProbeInstallation#ProbeDownloadPsacct][gratia-probe-psacct]]; or write your own based on samplemeter.pl or
samplemeter.py.
<LI>Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &quot;generic&quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.<br />We recommend a =batchsystem:FQDN= such as "condor:fermigrid1.fnal.gov". |
| !SiteName = &quot;Generic Site&quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !VDTSetupFile = &quot; =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION= /setup.sh&quot; |Path to the VDT =setup.sh= file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |

<LI>The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in root's crontab
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time. The time is appropriately randomized.

<LI>Under the directory gratia/condor-probes/gram_mods there are two
files that contain the changes to the Globus script. If gratia was
installed originally with VDT and the RPMS have been installed as
recommended under ${VDT_LOCATION}, nothing needs to be done. However, if
you get a post-install message regarding condor.pm and/or
managedfork.pm, please act upon that message.

<LI>The SOAPHost has been preconfigured to use the official OSG Gratia
collector (or the official ITB Gratia if your installed the ITB RPMs).
