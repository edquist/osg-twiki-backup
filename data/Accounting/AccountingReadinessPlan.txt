The implementation of the OSG Accounting System is named Gratia and follows the requirements
and design described in these [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][documents]].

For v0.0, we plan on deploying meters for Condor, LSF, PBS and disk storage.  We also plan to deploy the first version
of the collector and the interface between meters and collector.
