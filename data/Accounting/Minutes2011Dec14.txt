Tanya has installed webtools from OSG rpm repo and was able to configure and run it. There are some issues that have to be fixed. Ashu has 10% of effort allocated for webtools support. JIRA tickets should be created and assigned to Ashu. It looks like webtools are mature enough to replace BIRT. Tanya will send survey to stakeholders.
