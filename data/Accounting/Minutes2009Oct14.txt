---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

Chris: v1.06 going through its last round of testing.   Release likely to be made shortly.   Performance has improved by a factor 2 compared to v1.04.

Chris: The upgrade to v1.06 will incur a downtime due to the size increase of _XML columns.

---+Services Operation

---++OSG/Fermi

Dan: Going smoothly.
Deployment of upgrade has slipped (now looking at mid-november).

Dan: Size-wise the DB has apparently plateau-ed

---++RSV

Nothing reported.

---+OSG Issues

Brian: I added more local probe to the Gratia subversion repository even-though they are not OSG probes.
In particular the HapDoop probe, a real storage probe that Nebraska is using heavily.   I am working on a
posix version of the probe (for DCache).   In HaDoop du is 'constant' time.   For the posix du will not be
constant time, so it would need to be handled with care.   

The 2nd probe monitors the Condor 'evict' events.

Renaming Sites, in the Nebraska's graphic report we now support both the resource group name and resource name.

---+WLCG

If we release before Nov 1st. the first DN will be send to WLCG by November 16.

---+Fermi/CD

New development are planned but no manpower has been allocated (i.e. new hire)

---++DN summarization (John Hover)

---++BOINC probe (Sebastian G.)
