---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: gLexec
<ol>
<li>[[ProbeInstallation#DownloadTable][Install]] the software</li>

<li>Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &quot;generic&quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.<br />We recommend a =glexec:cluster_name= such as "glexec:cmswc1.fnal.gov". |
| !SiteName = &quot;Generic Site&quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !EnableProbe = &quot;1&quot; | If present, this attribute must be set to one to enable probe reporting. |
</li>

<li>The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in =/etc/cron.d=
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time; this time is randomized.</li>

<li>Unlike the other Gratia accounting probes, this probe must be installed on each worker node. See the [[ProbeInstallation#SourceRpm][notes on building from source rpm]] for a way to simplify the installation on multiple nodes by defining macros; it is not necessary to install this probe on CEs.</li>

<li>The !CollectorHost has been pre-configured to use the official OSG or ITB Gratia collector; please verify this configuration before enabling the probe.</li>
