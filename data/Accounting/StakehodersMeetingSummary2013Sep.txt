The Scientific Computing Division plans to include the scoreboard in Operations and Computing Liaison meeting reports. There will likely be tweaks needed towards this. 

As Intensity Frontier experiments are onboarded to OSG equivalent functionality to FIFEMON is needed for offsite in addition to the onsite resource usage. We would like a discussion of whether Gratia is a good collection point/interface to this information and/or the boundary between this and the !GlideinWMS information. 
[[http://fifemon.fnal.gov/]]  and drill downs e.g. [[http://fifemon.fnal.gov/pool/minos54/]]

Potential additional reports we will prioritize and make specific requests for User driven reports:
   * Standard panes of information handing to the experiments of what resources they are using and where and for feedback and planning. A report card – a scoreboard for each experiment. May involve some combining of data from FIFEMON and Gratia. 
   * Extending the reports for some standard information for FIFE and show at the Operations and the Liaisons meetings.
   * One click information
   * Targeted information for the experiments.

We would engaging the Division Head and !FermiDash project lead on a couple of metrics to show in the Fermilab Dashboard and investigate how this integration would be done.
