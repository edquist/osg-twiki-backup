---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: Metric
<ol>
<li>[[ProbeInstallation][Install]] the software using pacman or RPM.</li>

#ProbeConfig<li>Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &quot;generic&quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.<br />We recommend a =batchsystem:FQDN= such as "sge:fermigrid1.fnal.gov". |
| !SiteName = &quot;Generic Site&quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !VDTSetupFile = &quot;<tt>MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION</tt>/setup.sh&quot; |Path to the VDT =setup.sh= file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |
| !EnableProbe = &quot;1&quot; | If present, this attribute must be set to one to enable probe reporting. |
</li>

<li>The !CollectorHost has been pre-configured to use the official GOC metrics collector (or the official GOC ITB metrics collector if you installed the ITB RPMs); please verify this configuration before enabling the probe.</li>

</ol>
