---++ Description

The document attempts to describe the development and test environment for the Gratia accounting services.

---++ Software

In order to insure consistency in the development environment across mulitple real/xen nodes, the software packages that are required by Gratia have been stored in the __gratia__ user's $HOME directoy which is shared file file system.

*/home/gratia:*
   * mysql-rpms -!MySql client rpm only 
   * tomcat-tarballs - Tomcat tarballs 
   * jre-rpms - run time only These should be used for all new development and test installations. 
---++ Daily Builds

On a daily basis ( __gratia02__ cron), a script is run to bring down the HEAD node of the Gratia cvs source forge repository and perform a __'__ _make release_ __'__.

This allows developers to always have the latest Gratia build available for installation on their test instance.

Additionally, these daily builds will be used to perform daily upgrades of the Gratia instances described in the [[#Daily_installs_and_upgrades][Daily installs and upgrades]] section of this document.

In cvs, the script resides in __./gratia/build-scripts/nightly-build.sh__ .

*Cron entry:*
   * 01 0 * * * /home/gratia/cron-scripts/nightly-build.sh --mail gratia-operation@fnal.gov *Usage: nightly-build.sh [--dir directory] [--mail addresses] [--files n] [--help]* <br /><br />This script will perform an export of the HEAD of the Gratia CVS repository<br />and then perform a 'make release' on the software. <br /><br />NOTE: Since it is an export, you will not be able to effect any <br /> commits in this area.<br /><br />It will create a directory called gratia-builds in your $HOME <br />area unless overridden using the --dir argument. If the directory does not<br />exist, it will create it. <br /><br />Parent source directory: /home/weigand/gratia-builds/gratia-2008-07-18<br />Log file: /home/weigand/gratia-builds/gratia-2008-07-18.log<br /><br />CVS: cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@gratia.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gratia.<br /><br />Arguments:<br /> --dir - the parent directory for the gratia-builds directory<br /> --mail - email address(es) to be used if the build fails. This should be<br /> used only when running as a cron job. It will only send mail on<br /> failure. <br /> This should be specified when running as a cron process.<br /> --files - number of build directories to retain in /home/weigand/gratia-builds<br /> Since the source directory and log files are timestamped by day,<br /> this argument allows you to specify the number (not days) of <br /> builds to retain. This is a housekeeping thing. <br /> It is not perfect either. If you have too many successive days<br /> with failures, the symlink to the last good build will be<br /> invalid.<br /> Default: 7<br /><br />Cron entry note: do not redirect stdout/stderr to /dev/null or you may be <br /> oblivious to any uncaught errors.<br /><br />If you run this more than once per day, the parent source directory will be<br />overwritten each time. However the log file will be appended to.<br /><br />On success, it will create a symbolic link called gratia-latest to the<br />newly built gratia source directory. 

---++ Daily installs and upgrades

Currently, only the __gratiax33__ VDT instance of gratia is being upgraded on a daily basis from the [[#Daily_Builds][daily builds]] described in the previous section.

---++ Test Site Grid
 In order to provide a predictable and controlled test environment, a =test= grid site has been established. It will contain all the necessary components of an OSG grid site: 
   * The VOMS service ( =gratiax34=) has been populated with several VOs identified here: https://gratiax34.fnal.gov:8443/vomses %BR%If you are a member of the Gratia development team, you should have administrative privileges to view any data. 

   * The GUMS service ( =gratiax35=) uses the OSG =gums.config= template at this time. So it contains all OSG VOs and memberships as defined by the OSG GOC. At some point, it will be changed to use a =gums.config= file using the =gratiax34= VOMS service. 

   * several Compute Elements (CE) nodes running the various job batch queue managers (condor and pbs at this time). The authorization modes for these CE's can be established to use all three of the OSG modes: grid3, compatibility and full privilege. All will derive their membership lists for authorizations from the Gratia VOMS and GUMS servers mentioned above. For a more complete description of the OSG authorization modes, refer to the [[ReleaseDocumentation.ComputeElementAuthorization][OSG CE Authorization document]]. 

   * at least one Worker Node (WN) with glExec.
