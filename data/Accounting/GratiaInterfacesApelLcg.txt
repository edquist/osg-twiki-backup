---++ Description
Accounting records collected by Gratia are forwarded to the EGEE accounting system, APEL. This is important for US-LHC Tier1 and Tier2 facilities which have to demonstrate to the LHC project delivered computing resources on behalf of ATLAS and CMS collaborations, in accordance with signed Memorandum of Understanding agreements. A service outside the OSG software infrastructure (VDT) runs at Fermilab, parses and analyzes accounting records for a resource, scales wall time figures into <nop>SpecInt2000  for the processor type, and then forwards this data to an APEL server at the EGEE GOC

The APEL Accounting Portal at RAL has been storing CPU accounting results for WLCG.  On behalf on the ATLAS and CMS Tier 1 and Tier 2 that are part of OSG, OSG uploads usage information from Gratia into the APEL database.  This OSG data can be viewed in the 
%EGEE_PORTAL_OSG_VIEW%.  APEL is using sites registered in %OIM_HOME% and viewable in %MYOSG_HOME%

---++ Contact Information
For support issues on this interface, the contacts are:
   * Gratia Operations gratia-operations@opensciencegrid.org
   * APEL-WLCG Operations: apel-support@jiscmail.ac.uk

For non-support general type issues on this interface, the contacts are:
   * osg-wlcg-reports@opensciencegrid.org


---++ Frequency
The update is performed daily, aggregating usage information for the current month on a per site and VO basis (and effective 11/1/2009 by User Distinguished Name).  Each update is a complete refresh of the current month's usage.  In order to insure completeness of the previous month's usage, a special update is performed for the previous month for the 1st 15 days of the current month.  This special update allows for any late reporting to Gratia that may occur.  

These are cron jobs running between 00:00 and 02:00 Central Time daily. The update is performed by deleting the entire months data and then re-inserting (all using sql dml statements) the new summaries.  

The EGEE aggregator runs at 20 minutes past the hour, every two hours. As this process involves a lot of aggregation over a large database the actual time when the script looks in the OSG_TABLE table and adds this to the summary can vary. As a rule of thumb though, it should be every two hours.  The last update time can be viewed at the bottom of the %EGEE_PORTAL_OSG_VIEW% page.



---++ Gratia Usage information as it maps to APEL
Effective 5/20/09, two tables are being updated in the APEL database: 
   1 OSG_DATA - data is summarized by Site and VO.
   2 OSG_CN_DATA - data is summarized by Site, VO and User DN (Distinghuished Name).  
      * Prior to 11/1/2009 Gratia did not have the full User DN. It has only the CN portion of the proxy issuer (DN).  This is the <nop>CommonName field of the Gratia <nop>VOProbeSummary table.
      * Effective 11/1/2009, the full DN was made available in the <nop>DistinguishedName column of the <nop>VOProbeSummary table.

---+++ OSG_DATA table
In the _OSG_DATA_ table, Gratia data is summarized by Site and VO.

The table below shows the mapping of Gratia data to the APEL database's _OSG_DATA_ table and to the %EGEE_PORTAL_OSG_VIEW%.  It's purpose is to aid in understanding the data where different names are used for the data shown.

---+++ OSG_CN_DATA table
In the _OSG_CN_DATA_ table, Gratia data is summarized by Site, VO and User DN.  
   * Prior to 11/1/2009 Gratia did not have the full User DN. It has only the CN portion of the proxy issuer (DN).  This is the <nop>CommonName field of the Gratia <nop>VOProbeSummary table.
   * Effective 11/1/2009, the full DN was made available in the <nop>DistinguishedName column of the <nop>VOProbeSummary table.

The table below shows mapping of Gratia data to the APEL database's _OSG_CN_DATA_ table and to the %EGEE_PORTAL_OSG_VIEW%.  It's purpose is to aid in understanding the data where different names are used for the data shown.  The <nop>UserDN is not available in that view (called the Global view).  It is viewable in %EGEE_PORTAL_USER_VIEW% but only for the user certificate in the browser used to query the portal.

The reason for the complexity in extracting <nop>DistinguishedName in Gratia is 2-fold:
   1 the check for empty or 'Unknown' is because the <nop>DistinguishedName was not available in Gratia until 11/1/2009
   1 the even more complex exclusion of everything after the first ":/' was  to compensate for a new feature in Condor 7.3.2 and 7.4 that captured the VOMS proxies extended attributes and appended them to the _x509userproxysubject_ attribute which is the source of the data.



---++ APEL/EGEE Treatment of Virtual Organizations / VO Info and Site Names
In general, there are several outstanding accounting issues that are being addressed and can be viewed on the %EGEE_PORTAL_ACCOUNTING_ISSUES% page.

---+++ EGEE Portal Virtual Organizations / VO Info Mappings
The APEL/EGEE portal does some internal mapping of reported <nop> _LCGUserVO_  name to the VO name you view on the EGEE portal.  This mapping can be viewed at %EGEE_PORTAL_VO_MAPPINGS%


---+++ EGEE Portal OSG View - Site Names
For site name (<nop> _ExecutingSite_ in the APEL database), the %EGEE_PORTAL_OSG_VIEW% requires that a site be registered with %OIM_HOME% using the group names in %MYOSG_SITES%..

If the site is __not__ registered in OIM, it will __not__ be aggregated and sent to the EGEE portal OSG view.




---+++ EGEE Portal Tier1 View - Names and Sites
For  the %EGEE_PORTAL_TIER1_VIEW%, there is a table (_org_Tier1_) that defines the hierarchy or tree structure for the relationship between the Tier1 names and the Tier1 sites.  For the 2 VO's (cms and atlas) this interface is concerned with, these are the _org_Tier1_ table entries:

%TABLE{ tableborder="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1",databg="none,none"}%
    | US-FNAL-CMS                 |1.3 |
    | USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE |1.3.1 |
    | US-T1-BNL                       |1.4 |
    | BNL_ATLAS_1                |1.4.1 |
    | BNL                                   |1.4.2 |

US-FNAL-CMS and US-T1-BNL are the Tier1 names.

USCMS-FNAL-WC1-CE and BNL_ATLAS_1 are the respective Gratia reported sites (_ExecutingSite_ in the _OSG_DATA_ table) that comprise that name.

The BNL site is a special case.  It actually represents BNL_LCG2 data.  The data for BNL_LCG2 predates Gratia. Prior to having the BNL sites reporting  to Gratia, BNL had a special interface they developed to populate the APEL database in a table called OSG_DATA_BNL.  This table contains data from October 2005 through April 2007.  There was a transitional period (March/April 2007) where BNL migrated reporting  their nodes to Gratia.  Data for the BNL nodes for that period is contained in both the OSG_DATA_BNL and OSG_DATA tables.  We do not have visibility/access to the OSG_DATA_BNL table.  Since BNL_LCG2 predates Gratia, it was never registered in the GOC/VORS database.  So an  %EGEE_PORTAL_ASSOCIATION_TABLE%. is maintained that allows mapping of unregistered to registered sites.  There should exist an entry showing BNL_LCG2 mapped to BNL in that table.



---++ Normalization Factor and <nop>SpecInt 
As you've seen in the usage data sent to the APEL/WLCG data base, there is both a raw and normalized value.  The WLCG requires a normalization factor to be applied.  It is felt that this is the only fair means of comparing data across a wide variety of grid clusters. 

The normalization factor is basically a weighted average of a site's sub-cluster configuration as reported via GIP/BDII using <nop>SpecInt2000 benchmarks.
%TABLE%
| *Processor* | *Cores* | *SpecInt* | |
| Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.60GHz | 120| 978 | 117,360|
| Dual Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 270 | 102| 1,452 | 148,104|
| Summary:  (2 Subclusters) - Totals| 222|| 265,464|
| Normalization Factor ||| 1,196|

The following information related to the calculation of the normalization factor for each site can be at this Nebraska site: 
   * http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/wlcg_reporting#gip
and contains the following information:
   * GIP Sub-cluster Data (including the <nop>SpecInt for the processor)
   * Site Normalization Factors (as calculated using the GIP data and as used in the reporting to APEL/WLCG)

It should be noted that the validity of using <nop>SpecInt2000 as the basis of processor comparisons is something that is not addressed in this document.  

---++ VOs, Sites and Normalization Factors Used.
The list of sites, VOs, CPU/Wall Hours and normalization factors being reported can be viewed here under the ."Per-site WLCG Accounting Summary" table of contents entry:
   * http://t2.unl.edu/gratia/wlcg_reporting


---++ Multiple names for the same physical site
BNL_ATLAS_1 and BNL_ATLAS_2 are actually the same physical site with 2 head nodes which are both advertised in %MYOSG_SITES%. However, the site owner prefers to gather their accounting info  under a single umbrella (BNL_OSG) rather seeing it as 2 independent entities.  We currently have the mechanism to 'aggregate' more than one gatekeeper under one name. This is used by BNL to aggregate BNL_ATLAS_1 and BNL_ATLAS_2 under the name BNL_OSG. 

This same mechanism is used to easily renamed a site (for presentation purpose and upload to WLCG).    However this mechanism also means that for Gratia the 'sub' site are never reported about independently (So currently if you want information about  BNL_ATLAS_1 you need to go the 'Probe' reports and select the probe name (usually close to the hostname of the gatekeeper).

---++ Pending Enhancements
---+++ User level accounting data
Experiments have expressed their need to view user level accounting and this requirement is being addressed by the LCG Management Board.  The links below point some of the discussions regarding this subject:
   * LCG Management Board meeting 1/26/2009 - item 4%BR%https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LCG/MbMeetingsMinutes/LCG_Management_Board_2008_01_29.htm
   * LCG Management Board meeting 2/5/2009 - item 1.5%BR%https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/LCG/MbMeetingsMinutes/LCG_Management_Board_2008_02_05.htm

Gratia meeting minutes where this item was discussed:
   *  March 18, 2009 - https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Accounting/Minutes2009Mar18#WLCG

The user level accounting data being requested is the DN and FQAN of the user proxy.  

Gratia currently has the DN in the detail records but not in the summary tables.  The summary tables (which are used in the interface) contain only the !CommonName which represents the CN= portion of the full DN.
   * !KeyInfoContent column of the !JobUsageRecord table
   * !CommonName column of the !JobUsageRecord table and in the !MasterSummaryData table (and other summary views)

Currently and on an interim basis, the interface is reporting !CommonName to APEL as described in this [[GratiaInterfacesApelLcg#OSG_CN_DATA_table][section]]

The FQAN is available in both the detail table and in the summary tables:
   *  !VOName column of the !JobUsageRecord table and in the !VOProbeSummary table (a view of the !MasterSummaryData joined to the VO and !VONameCorrection tables)

A couple issues (or not) related to the availability of DN and FQAN:
   * At this time, not all sites are requiring use of a voms proxy which may (or may not) present a problem if FQAN is required for all users.  The DN will be available for both voms and grid proxies.   
   * Use of WS-GRAM without delegation is the only condition for which the Gratia probes cannot capture the FQAN.  This should be minimal if not non-existent. 

To get a feel of grid versus voms proxy use for the APEL Tier1 and Tier2 sites, the data below is from February 2009.  The !ProxyType (VOMS/Grid) is based on a string 'Role=' in the VO column (not shown) data.

---+++ Normalization factor issues
<OL>
<LI>As far as Gratia/Accounting is concerned, we would like to get to a point where each job usage record contain the type of cpu  that the job ran on.  This would give Gratia the most flexibility to normalized the result (normalization is required by WLCG and is the only to fairly compare the result). 

However, at this point the batch system does not gives us enough information (Condor 6.9 might be able to make the information available).   So for now we will rely for  normalization on a rougher estimate.  Currently the estimate comes from the average on one existing farm for which I know the actual hardware.  When the GLUE schema is properly filled, we will use the average for  the Site the job ran on.
</LI>

<LI>
The normalization factor is currently reflecting the latest cluster configuration.  As these clusters are upgraded over time, these factors will change.  In order to be able to re-create the normalized view of past periods, these configurations/factors will need to be keyed by time period somehow.

---++ Known issues
   * The issue of using SPEC_int2000 as a performance benchmark is becoming increasingly problematic as the benchmark has been deprecated, replaced by SPEC_int2006.  There are additional complications arising from differences in server/motherboard manufacturer, compiler option settings, etc.   There has been discussion of forming an agreed set of metrics for OSG using information collected through !HEPiX, evaluations within labs participating in OSG, etc.  At present, the following table has been prepared: see [[http://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/Admins/AccountingP2.html#Scaling_factors][this table for Fall 2007]] for *Fall 2007* figures.
   * The file =osg-user-vo-map.txt= *must* be kept up to date to correctly associate resource usage by specific Unix accounts in the accounting records to the corresponding VO.
