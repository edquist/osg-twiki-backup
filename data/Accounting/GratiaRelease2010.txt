   * The ui should provide for selecting data for fqan, (wildcarded with regular expression), DN
   * In Reports Date range selection specification should contain the last day, week, month, 6 months and year periods
   * Report displaying the run time profile (distribution) of jobs by Site and VO. Chart or xls format is acceptable. (RR21)
