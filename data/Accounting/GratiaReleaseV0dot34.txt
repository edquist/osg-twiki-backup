The following Gratia collectors and databases will __NOT__  be converted with this release.  These repositories contained specialized reports that have not as yet been upgraded to the new Birt V2..2.1 software. __However__, they will be taken out-of-service while the other databases are being updated.

<!--   CONVERSION STEPS -------------------- -->
---+ Conversion steps
This document describes a general guideline for implementing Gratia collector/reporting upgrades with the following goals:
   * minimize downtime as perceived by probes and report browsers
   * test all collector and reporting functions

There are 2 major components of the Gratia collector/reporting services that reside on the 2 separate processors:
   * Tomcat services - %CURRENT_TOMCAT% (aliased as %TOMCAT_ALIAS%)
   * !MySql DBMS - %CURRENT_MYSQL% (aliased as %MYSQL_ALIAS%)


The basic premise for these guidelines is the availability of a duplicate set of processors and available storage which will allow for continued operation of the  production services while the conversion and testing is taking place.  The 2nd set of hosts will be updated from production.  Any conversions (software and dbms) are performed.  The upgraded system is then tested. Then, once the conversion and testing is complete, The replication feature of Gratia can then be utilized to bring the converted components up-to-date.  When this is complete, the aliases can be changed to point to the upgraded hosts.

   <li>Taking a back up the database instance on _gratia06_ (this will include all schema) using part of the _msqlhotcopy_cron_ script.
           This is in the event that the compacting of the <nop>JobUsageRecord_Xml has insufficient space and corrupts the table. Backup is only being done to  _/backup/mysqldb_ on _gratia06_ .

</ol>

---++ Prerequisites steps
<ol>
<li> Determine the disk space requirements for the database on %NEW_MYSQL%.  Notify the administrator Steve Timm.</li>
<li>
</ol>

---++ Conversion steps
The procedure below has specific references to the conversion of the current Gratia database schema's from !MyISAM to !InnoDB and also contains software upgrades to Gratia.


---+++ !MySql database and Gratia Collector/Reporting Services Testing
<ol>
<li>For the new !MySql DBMS:%BR%
%BLUE% *Production downtime*: Steps 1b through  1e.%ENDCOLOR%
<ol type="a">
<li>Configure a new !MySQL instance on %NEW_MYSQL% with the desired !InnoDB and default engine parameters.
%BLUE%<li>Shutdown *ALL* collectors on %CURRENT_TOMCAT% and allow all threads to complete any database updates including the replication services.</li>
<li>Determine the last _dbid_ set in the  _JobUsageRecord_ and _MetricRecord_ tables.  These values will be used to start the Gratia replication process for Job Usage and Metrics in order to bring the new converted database back to a current state.  This can be performed by running the following sql commands on the %CURRENT_MYSQL% !MySql instance:</li>
<pre>
select max(dbid) from JobUsageRecord;
select max(dbid) from MetricRecord;
</pre>
<li>Take a standard tree copy of the mysqldb tree on %CURRENT_MYSQL% and copy it to %NEW_MYSQL% </li>
<li>Startup *ALL* collectors on %CURRENT_TOMCAT%.%ENDCOLOR%</li>
<li>On %NEW_MYSQL%, convert all tables to !InnoDB, timing the exercise.</li>
<li>Test to see if the new !InnoDB database can successfully be backed up via !TiBS and recovered</li>
</ol>

<li>For the new Gratia Collector/Reporting Tomcat services:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Install a new Gratia collector on %NEW_TOMCAT%.</li>
<li>Connect the  new collector/reporter (%NEW_TOMCAT%) to the converted !MySql DB (%NEW_MYSQL%).</li>
</ol>

<li> Test the collector and reporting services on the new instances (%NEW_TOMCAT%, %NEW_MYSQL%) based on the details in the [[#Testing_the_conversion][Testing the conversion section of this document]].</li>

</ol>

---+++ Gratia Collector/Reporting Conversion
<ol>
<li>Announce a downtime for the production collector long enough to allow the completion of steps [[#StepNum05][5]] through [[#StepNum09][9]].</li>

<li>Set up a replication process from the production collector to the temporary collector, with DBID carefully set to only replicate records
received since DB copy (manual DB interaction).</li>

<li>Stop updates to the production DB and shut down the production collector after allowing replication to the temporary collector to complete.</li>

<li>Remove the replication (manual DB interaction).</li>

<li>Shut down the temporary collector after it has received the last replicated records from the production collector and take a note of the latest DBID (manual DB interaction) in the usage records on the temporary DB.</li>

<li>Upgrade the production collector.</li>

<li>Connect the production collector to the converted DB and bring it back up to receive data.</li>
</ol>



---+ Testing the conversion
---++ Reporting
Testing of the Gratia reporting and administration services is  a manual process exercising the various reports/drill downs on all screens. This should be done in 2 stages:
<ol>
<li>Testing the basic functionality</li>
<ul>
<li>This should be done before the testing of the [[#Collector_Probes][Collector/Probes testing]].  </li>
<li>   </li>
</ul>
</ol>

---++ Collector/Probes
Testing of the Gratia collectors can be performed by activating the Job Usage and Metric Replication services on the production server (%CURRENT_TOMCAT%) for all database schema.
