---++Introduction

Welcome to the home of <b>%WIKITOOLNAME%.%WEB%</b>.  The Grid Accounting and Auditing OSG Activity designs and deploys robust, scalable, trustable and dependable grid accounting and auditing services, publishes an interface to the services and provides a reference implementation

Goals

The main goal of the Grid Accounting and Auditing Joint Project, which is additionally being contributed as an OSG Activity, is to provide the stakeholders with a reliable and accurate set of views of the Grid resources usage.

The Grid Accounting Project will:

	* design the schema for the accounting attributes, 
	* ensure the necessary collectors and sensors are in place in the resource providers, 
	* define and deploy repository and access tools for the reporting and analysis of the grid wide accounting information.  

The Accounting system will properly determine a confidence level in the existing accounting information and adequately address and present erroneous or missing accounting data.

The accounting system will adequately protect the privacy of the users and organizations involved.

The auditing system will use information from the accounting system and link it to information from other sources to allow full tracking and analysis of the actions and events related to a user’s resource usage. 

The auditing system needs to be able to present the immediate and short term information of the state and transitions in a user’s use of a resource.

The initial main goal for the accounting system will be to track VO members’ resource usage and to present that information in a consistent Grid-wide view, focusing in particular on CPU and Disk Storage utilization
