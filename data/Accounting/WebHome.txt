---++Introduction

The Grid Accounting Activity is designing and deploying robust, scalable, trustable and dependable grid accounting services, publishing an interface to the services and providing a reference implementation.

The chair of the Activity is Philippe Canal. The mail list is osg-accounting@opensciencegrid.org

---+++Goals

The main goal of the Grid Accounting Joint Project, which is additionally being contributed as an OSG Activity, is to provide the stakeholders with a reliable and accurate set of views of the Grid resources usage.

The Grid Accounting Project has:

   * designed the schema for the accounting attributes, 
   * is ensuring the necessary collectors and sensors are in place in the resource providers, 
   * has defined and is deploying repository and access tools for the reporting and analysis of the grid wide accounting information.  

The Accounting system will properly determine a confidence level in the existing accounting information and adequately address and present erroneous or missing accounting data.

The accounting system will adequately protect the privacy of the users and organizations involved.

The auditing system will use information from the accounting system and link it to information from other sources to allow full tracking and analysis of the actions and events related to a user?s resource usage. 

The auditing system needs to be able to present the immediate and short term information of the state and transitions in a user?s use of a resource.

The initial main goal for the accounting system will be to track VO members? resource usage and to present that information in a consistent Grid-wide view, focusing in particular on CPU and Disk Storage utilization

See the current [[ListOfPriorities][list of priorites]] and the current [[ListOfRequests][list of enhancement requests]]

---++Monitoring vs Accounting
For monitoring,the goal is to have a view of the current status of the system with minimal delay. Small numerical errors, 
approximation and statistical estimation in the data are not fatal for monitoring.  For example if a CPU is utilized at 82% or 85% does not matter to the monitoring system. For monitoring, missing informatio is not really an issue. For example, the measurement of the cpu load is not really affected if we are missing a few samples.

For accounting, the goal is to have an accurate view of the resource and service usage in the system.  This includes linking them to the individual user request.  The accounting should not loss any accounting data or record.  The main focus is on the historical view and a delay in the information is acceptable. However the information need to be as accurate as possible, and include an estimate of its accuracy.  The accounting system need to be able to support the development of an economic mode.

The type of information and the means of collecting this information are similar between monitoring and accounting but the choices of trade-offs are clearly different; for example timeliness vs. accuracy and completeness.


---++Requirements

We presented a summary of the Accounting System requirement in July 2005 in Milwaukee.
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][OSG Accounting Requirements Presentation]]
We also presented a general overview of the design ([[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][See the same link]]).
One more requirement is to produce summary reports like [[Monalisa]] or [[Panda]] or [[OU]]

---++Installation

At this point, the Gratia Services package (the "server") is not open for distribution. We are however encouraging installation of the Gratia probes (the "clients") via RPM which send data back to the official Gratia Server. For instructions on installation, please see ProbeInstallation.
The Gratia service InstallationGuide is intended to be used by the VDT team in order for packaging the services in the next release of VDT. 
The VDT-team [[InstallationGuideVDT][Gratia service installation guide]] is intended to be used only by the VDT team for packaging the Gratia services; and the [[InstallationGuideFNAL][FNAL-specific guide]] is solely for local installation here at FNAL with multiple collectors.

---++Reports

Reports can be viewed at several places depending on the type of data being collected:

   * [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/][Production OSG sites]]
   * [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8884/gratia-reporting/][OSG daily summaries (legacy)]]
   * [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8881/gratia-reporting/][ITB and testing]]
   * [[http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8882/gratia-reporting/][Fermilab's PS-accounting information (Fermi-specific)]]
   * [[http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8883/gratia-reporting/][Fermilab's LQCD batch system (non-OSG)]]

These reports are implemented using the open source Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools - [[http://www.eclipse.org/birt/][BIRT]].

For a more detailed description on the type and use of the reports  please refer to GratiaReportGuide
