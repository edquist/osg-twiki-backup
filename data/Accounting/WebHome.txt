---++ Gratia Accounting Reports for OSG and Fermilab

Reports can be viewed at several places depending on the type of data being collected:

   * [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8880/gratia-reporting/][Production OSG sites]]
   * [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8884/gratia-reporting/][OSG daily summaries (legacy)]]
   * [[http://gratia-osg.fnal.gov:8881/gratia-reporting/][ITB and testing]]
   * [[http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8882/gratia-reporting/][Fermilab's PS-accounting information (Fermi-specific)]]
   * [[http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8883/gratia-reporting/][Fermilab's LQCD batch system (non-OSG)]]

These reports are implemented using the open source Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools - [[http://www.eclipse.org/birt/][BIRT]].

For a more detailed description on the type and use of the reports  please refer to GratiaReportGuide

---++ Short Description

The Gratia Project (contributed as an OSG Activity) designs and deploys robust, scalable, trustable and dependable grid accounting, publishes an interface to the services and provides a reference implementation.

[[Definition of an OSG Job][OSG Job]]

---++ Introduction

The Grid Accounting Activity is designing and deploying robust, scalable, trustable and dependable grid accounting services, publishing an interface to the services and providing a reference implementation.

---+++ Contact information and mailing lists

   * The project lead is [[mailto:pcanal@fnal.gov][Philippe Canal]].
%INCLUDE{"ContactUs"}%

---+++ Meetings

The Gratia team meets weekly on Wednesday at 1:30pm CST.   To Join call 510-665-5437 and use the meeting ID: 2966.

See [[MeetingMinutes][Meeting Minutes]]

---+++ Metrics 

See [[Metrics][the Metrics page]].

---++ Goals

The main goal of the Grid Accounting Joint Project, which is additionally being contributed as an OSG Activity, is to provide the stakeholders with a reliable and accurate set of views of the Grid resources usage.

The Grid Accounting Project:

   * has designed the schema for the accounting attributes, 
   * is ensuring the necessary collectors and sensors are in place in the resource providers, 
   * has defined and is deploying repository and access tools for the reporting and analysis of the grid wide accounting information.  

The Accounting system will properly determine a confidence level in the existing accounting information and adequately address and present erroneous or missing accounting data.

The Accounting system will adequately protect the privacy of the users and organizations involved.

The initial main goal for the accounting system will be to track VO members' resource usage and to present that information in a consistent Grid-wide view, focusing in particular on CPU and Disk Storage utilization.

See the current [[ListOfPriorities][list of priorites]] and the current [[ListOfRequests][list of enhancement requests]]

---++ Monitoring vs Accounting
For monitoring,the goal is to have a view of the current status of the system with minimal delay. Small numerical errors, 
approximation and statistical estimation in the data are not fatal for monitoring.  For example if a CPU is utilized at 82% or 85% does not matter to the monitoring system. For monitoring, missing informatio is not really an issue. For example, the measurement of the cpu load is not really affected if we are missing a few samples.

For accounting, the goal is to have an accurate view of the resource and service usage in the system.  This includes linking them to the individual user request.  The accounting should not loss any accounting data or record.  The main focus is on the historical view and a delay in the information is acceptable. However the information need to be as accurate as possible, and include an estimate of its accuracy.  The accounting system need to be able to support the development of an economic mode.

The type of information and the means of collecting this information are similar between monitoring and accounting but the choices of trade-offs are clearly different; for example timeliness vs. accuracy and completeness.


---++ Requirements

We presented a summary of the Accounting System requirement in July 2005 in Milwaukee.
[[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][OSG Accounting Requirements Presentation]]
We also presented a general overview of the design ([[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][See the same link]]).

---+++ Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
---++++ Gratia database
The ERD for the Gratia database can be see in the formats listed below.  It should be noted that it is not a "complete" picture of all the relationships.  Many of the foreign key relationships were deliberately left off in order to simplify the diagram.  The intent is to show the main parent/child relationships only.

---+++ Development and Test Environment
A description of the development and test environment can be found in the [[GratiaDevAndTestEnviron][Gratia Development and Test Environment]] page.

---+++ Production database conversion procedure from !MyISAM to !INNODB
The latest version of the database conversion procedure may be found [[INNODBConversionProcedure][here]]; the original draft may be seen [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"view"}%/Accounting/INNODBConversionProcedure?rev=1][here]].

---++ Production Releases
---+++ [[GratiaReleaseV0dot28][Gratia Release v0.28 - 10/27/2007]]
---+++ [[GratiaReleaseInnodb][Gratia Release v0.30 - 11/16/2007 InnoDB Conversion]]
---+++ [[GratiaReleaseV0dot32][Gratia Release v0.32 - 12/2007 or 01/2008]]
---+++ [[GratiaReleaseV0dot34][Gratia Release v0.28 - 02/2008]]

---+++ [[GratiaReleaseV0dot38][Gratia Release v0.28 - 06/2008]]

---++ Installation

At this point, the Gratia Services package (the "server") is not open for distribution. We are however encouraging installation of the Gratia probes (the "clients") via RPM which send data back to the official Gratia Server. For instructions on installation, please see ProbeInstallation.

The VDT-team [[InstallationGuideVDT][Gratia service installation guide]] is intended to be used only by the VDT team for packaging the Gratia services; and the [[InstallationGuideFNAL][FNAL-specific guide]] is solely for local installation here at FNAL with multiple collectors.
