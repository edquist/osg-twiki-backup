---++ Short Description

The Gratia Project (contributed as an OSG Activity) designs and deploys robust, scalable, trustable and dependable grid accounting, publishes an interface to the services and provides a reference implementation.

---++ Introduction and Overview

The Grid Accounting Activity is designing and deploying robust, scalable, trustable and dependable grid accounting services, publishing an interface to the services and providing a reference implementation.

The Gratia system consists of many probes operating on and uploading data from remote locations to a network of one or more collector-reporting systems. These data could be regarding batch jobs, grid transfers, storage allocation, site availability tests or processing acconting (at current survey).

The primary focus of the Gratia system is however to providing an accounting of [[Definition of an OSG Job][OSG jobs]].

More information on the data collection philosophy, technical details and algorithms used by the various probes, the common probe infrastructure and the collector may be found in the [[GratiaDataCollectionNotes][Data Collection Notes]] section.

---+++ Contact information and mailing lists

   * The project was led by [[mailto:pcanal@fnal.gov][Philippe Canal]] until October, 2011. The current lead is [[mailto:tlevshin@fnal.gov][Tanya Levshina]]

---+++ Meetings

The Gratia team meets bi-weekly on Wednesday at 3pm CST. To Join call 866-740-1260 and use the meeting ID: 8408730, followed by #.

---++ Gratia Accounting Reports

Reports are implemented using the open source Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools - [[http://www.eclipse.org/birt/][BIRT]].

For a more detailed description on the type and use of the reports please refer to GratiaReportGuide. These reports may be viewed at several places depending on the type of data being collected:

   * Individual site- and VO-specific emails are mailed weekly and monthly and may be requested by adding "Reporting Contact" names to the OIM registration for the resource or VO in question.

---++ Goals

The main goal of the Grid Accounting Joint Project, which is additionally being contributed as an OSG Activity, is to provide the stakeholders with a reliable and accurate set of views of the Grid resources usage.

The Grid Accounting Project:

   * has designed the schema for the accounting attributes, 
   * is ensuring the necessary collectors and sensors are in place in the resource providers, 
   * has defined and is deploying repository and access tools for the reporting and analysis of the grid wide accounting information. 

The Accounting system will properly determine a confidence level in the existing accounting information and adequately address and present erroneous or missing accounting data.

The Accounting system will adequately protect the privacy of the users and organizations involved.

The initial main goal for the accounting system will be to track VO members' resource usage and to present that information in a consistent Grid-wide view, focusing in particular on CPU and Disk Storage utilization.

[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/viewfile/Accounting/WebHome?filename=AccountingProjectDefinition1.doc][Full Project Definition]]

See the current [[GratiaRelease2010][list of priorites]].

---++ Monitoring vs Accounting
For monitoring,the goal is to have a view of the current status of the system with minimal delay. Small numerical errors, approximation and statistical estimation in the data are not fatal for monitoring. 
For example if a CPU is utilized at 82% or 85% does not matter to the monitoring system. 
For monitoring, missing informatio is not really an issue. 
For example, the measurement of the cpu load is not really affected if we are missing a few samples.

For accounting, the goal is to have an accurate view of the resource and service usage in the system. This includes linking them to the individual user request. The accounting should not loss any accounting data or record. The main focus is on the historical view and a delay in the information is acceptable. However the information need to be as accurate as possible, and include an estimate of its accuracy. The accounting system need to be able to support the development of an economic mode.

The type of information and the means of collecting this information are similar between monitoring and accounting but the choices of trade-offs are clearly different; for example timeliness vs. accuracy and completeness.

---++ Software

There is an RSV "probe" that monitors Gratia and allows for troubleshooting and diagnostics in case of problems. For full details, see the [[GratiaRSVMonitoringProbe][Gratia RSV Monitoring Probe]] page.

---++ Requirements

We presented a summary of the Accounting System requirement in July 2005 in Milwaukee. [[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][OSG Accounting Requirements Presentation]] We also presented a general overview of the design ([[http://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=205&version=1][See the same link]]).

---+++ Reporting Requirements

Summary of the ReportRequirements that have been outlined in the above documents.

---+++ Operational Requirements

See the discussions and documents in OperationalRequirements.

---+++ Gratia Login/Access Requirements
 Access to Gratia administration and reporting features and view are defined in the [[GratiaAccessLoginSpecification][Gratia Login/Access Specification document]].

---++ Implementation (developers' corner)

---+++ Development and Test Environment
The main source code repository is keep in SVN at sourceforge.net.  See the following SvnPrimer.

 A description of the development and test environment can be found in the [[GratiaDevAndTestEnviron][Gratia Development and Test Environment]] page.

---+++ Collector build and release-cutting procedure.

This is described on the [[CollectorBuildRelease][collector build and release-cutting procedure]] page.

This is described on the [[ProbeBuildRelease][probe build and release-cutting procedure]] page.

---+++ Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
 The ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for the Gratia database can be see in the formats listed below. It should be noted that it is not a "complete" picture of all the relationships. Many of the foreign key relationships were deliberately left off in order to simplify the diagram. The intent is to show the main parent/child relationships only.
