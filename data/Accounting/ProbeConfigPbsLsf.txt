---+OSG Gratia probe configuration: PBS-LSF
<ol>
<li>[[ProbeInstallation#DownloadTable][Install]] the software. Notes:
<ol>
#ProbeNode<li>The probe should have access to:
<ul>
<li>The batch manager log area (required); and</li>
<li> the reverse gridmap file, =osg-user-vo-map.txt=  (optional, but preferred). [This file was used to be =grid3-user-vo-map.txt=]</li>
</ul>
The PBS/LSF probe can in fact run on any node provided the above requirements are satisfied and =ProbeConfig= is configured correctly.
<li>The [[ProbeInstallation#ProbeDownloadPbsLsf][official binary RPMs]] were build on a FSL4 system: to install on a system with a different C++ compiler (eg RHEL3 and derivatives), [[ProbeSrpmNotes][recompile from SRPM]].</li>
</ol>
</li>
#ProbeConfig<li>Customize the Gratia =ProbeConfig= file. The following variables (at least)
should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !MeterName = &quot;generic&quot; | This value will be entered in the database to indicate where the record came from.<br />We recommend a =batchsystem:FQDN= such as "condor:fermigrid1.fnal.gov". |
| !SiteName = &quot;Generic Site&quot; | This value is used in the report to refer to the site/farm/cluster to which the head node gives access. |
| !VDTSetupFile = &quot;<tt>MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION<tt>/setup.sh&quot; |Path to the VDT =setup.sh= file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |
| !UserVOMapFile = &quot;<tt>MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION<tt>/osg/etc/osg-user-vo-map.txt&quot; |Path to the VDT =osg-user-vo-map.txt= (or =grid3-user-vo-map.txt=) file. Please expand =MAGIC_VDT_LOCATION=. |
</li>

#UrCollectorConf<li>Customize the =urCollector.conf= file. The following variables (at least) should have appropriate values:

| *Gratia Configuration Variable=&quot;Default&quot;* | *Set value information* |
| !lrmsType = &quot;pbs&quot; | Set to &quot;pbs&quot; or &quot;lsf&quot; as appropriate. |
| !pbsAcctLogDir = &quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot; | Set to appropriate path for log files. |
| !lsfAcctLogDir = &quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot; | Set to appropriate path for log files. |
| !useCEJobMap = &quot;no&quot; | Set to yes if using a CE job map (see below). |
| !ceJobMapLog = &quot;&quot; | This is the location of the CE's grid user/grid job -> local job ID map. It has to be specified _either_ as a directory (containing file names such as "20050307" or "2005-03-07") _or_ as a file name prefix (including path). |
| !EnableProbe = &quot;1&quot; | If present, this attribute must be set to one to enable probe reporting. |
</li>

<li>The RPM install procedure makes appropriate entries in =/etc/cron.d=
for uploading accounting information to gratia at the appropriate
time; this time is randomized.</li>

<li>The !CollectorHost has been pre-configured to use the official OSG Gratia
collector (or the official ITB Gratia if you installed the ITB RPMs); please verify this configuration before enabling the probe.</li>

<li>This product includes software developed by [[http://cern.ch/eu-egee/][The EU EGEE Project]].</li>
