---+ Main gratia DB - Upgrade to v0.34.9
%EDITTHISTEXT%

The main Gratia database ( *gratia* ) served by the *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* instance will require a very long conversion time. So to maximize availability we will:
   1 create a current copy of the *gratia06/gratia* database on *gratia07* 
   1 using a temporary Gratia collector on *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion* 
      * this collector will be upgraded to v0.34.9 allowing the new summary table and md5v2 checksums to be calculated. 
      * we will then replicate from *gratia06* to *gratia07* to "catch up" the database before we switch the production *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* over to using it. 
   1 switch the current *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* to use the *gratia07/gratia* database 
   1 perform the upgrade of the *gratia06/gratia* database to v0.34.9 using the Gratia collector on *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion* . 
   1 While the checksum upgrades are occurring, we will replicate from *gratia07* to *gratia06* so the "catch up" time to make it current is reduced. 
   1 when the upgrade is complete (inclusive of the conversion to the new md5 key), we will switch the *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* instance back to using the *gratia06/gratia* database 

During the upgrade period, this will be the tomcat/database environement for the *gratia* database: 
%TABLE%
| *Tomcat instance* | *Database instance* |
| gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia port 8880 | gratia07:/data/mysqldb/gratia port 3320 |
| gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion port 8884 | gratia06:/data/mysqldb/gratia port 3320 |

The above is a high level summary of the process. The details are contained in subsequent sections.

---++ Create a copy of the current database on *gratia07*
 On 5/28, the *gratia07:/data/mysqldb* was re-partitioned into a single 200Gb area to provide the required space for the *gratia* database.

---+++ Create the *gratia07:gratia* database using the ZRM backup
 This is in process now (5/30) and a finalized procedure will be included when it completes.

---+++ Configure *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion* to use the *gratia07:gratia* database
 On *gratia08*, edit the */data/tomcat-conversion/gratia/service-configuration.properties* file for this resulting attribute:

*Wait* until the *gratia07* is caught up to the *gratia06* database. You can monitor this by:
   * on *gratia06* %BR% - select max(dbid) from <nop>JobUsageRecord_Meta; %BR% - select max(dbid) from <nop>MetricRecord_Meta; %BR% 
   * on *gratia07* %BR% - select max(dbid) from <nop>JobUsageRecord_Meta; %BR% - select max(dbid) from <nop>MetricRecord_Meta; %BR% 

When they are close, stop the *administrative update service* on
   * http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration 

The replication services should still be running to ensure we "catch up" the last of the updates on *gratia06* to *gratia07*. The replication activity shall be complete when both replication data pumps (as shown by =gratia-0.log= on gratia08) have been through at least one check-duplicate cycle without uploading records.

Then, turn off both the *Job Usage* and *Metric* replication services on:
   * http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration for <nop>http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8884. 
   * Do *not* delete the entries at this time.%BR% 

Take note of max(dbid) in =JobUsageRecord_Meta= and =MetricRecord_Meta= on *gratia07*, as these numbers will be used to set up replication from *gratia07* back to *gratia06* while checksums are being upgraded on *gratia06*.

---+++ Update the Replication services on *gratia06* to *gratia07*
 On *gratia06*, if there are *Job Usage* and *Metric* replication services active, we will need to create entries in the *gratia07* instance as this will shortly become our production database.

When creating these entries, we will need to insure that we start with the last record replicated from *gratia06*, which may not have the same dbid on gratia06 as it did on gratia07.

Instructions for doing this will be provided later if this needs to be performed for this release.

This should be done *before* we switch the *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* to use the *gratia07/gratia* database.

The entries should be added and *only* a test that the entry is correct made at this time. We will set the *starting dbid* later and activate the entry after we switch the tomcat collectors.

---++ Stop *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* and *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion*
 Stop each collector: 
   1 on *gratia08* 
      * service tomcat-conversion stop

 The first thing that has to be done is to bounce the gratia06 database to allow the new my.cnf entries to take affect. <pre>innodb_buffer_pool_size = 768M </pre> This parameter was expended from 512 to 768 to hopefully avoid the table lock problem experienced on gratia07 last week.

The use of binary log files has been left in effect as they are needed for backups.

Perform a manual mysql client execution of the following so we reduce the time for the tables to be changed. The hibernate instance single threads these.
<pre>alter table JobUsageRecord_Meta add column GridDescription varchar(255),  add column md5v2 varchar(255), add index index17(md5v2);    </pre>

*MUST WAIT FOR CHECKSUM CALCULATIONS TO COMPLETE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FINAL RESOLUTION PHASE.*

---++ Start replication from production collector to upgrade collector.
 After initial schema upgrades on *gratia06/gratia* are complete and *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion/gratia* is listening for new records, activate the replication of !JobUsageRecord table records.

The dbid to start with was determined in an earlier step when we switched to using gratia07.
   * the last dbid at that time on gratia07 was *79801016* 
   * We do not have to do !MetricRecords as there should be no !MetricRecords. Those that are there are a mistake 

Using the UI on http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration (this is pointing to the *gratia07* database):
   * create a replication entry pointing to *http://gratia08.fnal.gov:8884* (this is pointing to the *gratia06* database). 
   * test it 
   * then using a !Myql client update the dbid to *79801016*: <pre>update Replication set dbid=79801016 where openconnection='http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8884'; </pre> 
   * start the replication in the UI 

---++ Monitor upgrade process on *gratia06/gratia and stop replication
 Towards the end of the upgrade of *gratia06/gratia*, updates to the DB will be stopped pending a final duplicate resolution phase and conversion of the index on =md5v2= to unique.

Between this happening and the listener queue hitting its threshold, replication from *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* to *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion/gratia* should be stopped.

---++ Watch for upgrade completion and complete replication

When the upgrade of *gratia06/gratia* is complete,
   * the index =index17(md5v2)= on !JobUsageRecord_Meta will have its =non_unique= attribute set to 0 
   * and, *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia/logs/gratia-0.log* will indicate that the listeners have been reactivated. 

At this time:
   1 Restart replication from *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* to *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion*. 
   1 Stop DB updates on *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia*. 
   1 Wait until replication is complete. 

---++ Switch the current *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia* to use the *gratia06/gratia* database
 To switch-over the tomcat collectors: 
   1 Stop each collector 
      * on *gratia08* %BR% - service tomcat-conversion stop 
      * on *gratia09* %BR% - service tomcat-gratia stop 
   1 Update the *service-configuration.properties* file to change the databases they point to 
      * on *gratia08:/data/tomcat-conversion/gratia* %BR% - service.mysql.url=jdbc:mysql:// *gratia07*.fnal.gov:3320/gratia 
      * on *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia/gratia* %BR% - service.mysql.url=jdbc:mysql:// *gratia06*.fnal.gov:3320/gratia 
   1 If necessary, change dbid in =Replication= table entries on gratia06 to match correct max(dbid) values for =Meta= tables on *gratia06* 
   1 Start the *gratia09* production collector *only* (it will be using the *gratia06* database 
      * on *gratia09* %BR% - service tomcat-gratia start 

At this point production gratia reporting and services area back on-line and available and using the *gratia06* database

Verify there are no problems by tailing the log files in *gratia09:/data/tomcat-gratia/logs* .

---++ Backups
 We will need to *start* the backups on *gratia06* for the *gratia* database.

And *deactivate* the backups on the *gratia07* database for the gratia database.

---++ Crons
---+++ Cron processes
 There are several processes (cron) that will need to be copied/modified on _gratia06_ and _gratia09_ for reports and interfaces. 
   1 gratia06 - user gratia 
      * APEL-WLCG interface <pre> dir=/home/gratia/interfaces/apel-lcg; cd $dir; ./lcg.sh --config=lcg.conf --date=current --update </pre> This cron process remained on *gratia06*. The only modification required is to the */home/gratia/interfaces/apel-lcg/lcg-db.conf* file for the following parameter to point it back to the *gratia06* database. 
         * GratiaHost *gratia-db01*.fnal.gov <p> </p>

   1 gratia06 - user root<br /> Database backups on *gratia06* will need to be changed to now include the *gratia* database. This includes the purging of log files by the zrm process. <pre>/usr/local/bin/gratia_backup_cron.sh /usr/bin/mysql-zrm --action purge </pre> <p> </p> <p> </p> 
   1 gratia09 - user root<br /> The static reports cron on gratia09 *did not* require changing as it references the gratia09 gratia collector which will now be pointed back to the gratia06 database. <p> </p> <p> </p> 
   1 gratia07 - user root<br /> This database backup cron entry needs to be *removed* from this cron. <pre>/usr/local/bin/gratia_backup_cron.sh /usr/bin/mysql-zrm --action purge </pre> The */usr/local/bin/gratia_backup_cron.sh* script can be removed as well. 

---+++ Nebraska (Brian Bockelman) interfaces
 Notify Brian to switch back to using *gratia-db01:3320* database.
