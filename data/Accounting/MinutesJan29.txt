Nothing to report.

Jeff: I have encountered some problem when changing the parameters name and/or content

However I am doing some progress.

Penelope: I am still investigating Birt 2.2.

---++VDT Releases.

Chris G: One minor issue was discovered and fixed during the Integration Fest.

---++Probes.

Chris: I will have a packaged version (rpm) of the SGE probe.  I have a couple
of issue with some of their choice (assumed location for the log file and do not
handle well 'log rotate'.  

Chris: They are doing their own DN lookup in the grid map file (which may 
unfortunately not always be there).

Philippe: We also need (per request of the OSG Security Officer) to get the
info for PBS and LSF. 

Chris: We need to get this from GRAM.

---++Storage Probe.

Philippe: DCache probe is to be deployed.  It is now waiting on Philippe/Chris to
update the database to handle multiple record type in a form that it is 'easy to use' 
for reporting.  

---++Metrics.

John U.: Doing a nice 3d graphics for PR for OSG.

Greg: I will look for a freeware that might be helpful.

John U.: I have some contact with Monalisa, they __seem__ to have an idea
on how to use the Monalisa web services.  I still donot know what is the
meaning of the data yet .... I have to download the 'web service' to see
the examples.
