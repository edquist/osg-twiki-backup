---+++ Stakeholder Issues 
---++++Fermi

*FermiCloud*

__Steven Timm__

   1. !OpenNebula 4 testing is in progress, thus far only minor modifications needed to the probe.
   1. We expect to deploy the Idle VM detection/reclamation software that was developed in last summer's CRADA.  Part of this will be investigating if we want to report the idle/busy data of this probe to Gratia.
   1. Default !FermiCloud VM's currently are launched with a gratia-probe-psacct.  We are wondering if anyone in management is using the psacct data anymore.

*Operation*

__Joe Boyd__

*dCache Archive Project*

__Dmitry O Litvintsev__ 

On behalf of dCache project at Fermilab, thanks for great support of gratia.

Things that we consider to be useful:
   1. handle new user vo mapping automatically. May be outside the scope of gratia project.
   2. modification for dCache transfer probe bytes transferred by VOs:
      * be able to plot writes and reads
      * be able to plot all/only successful transfers

---++++Nebraska 
From __Brian__:
 Can't think of anything "pressing" for this quarter.
The biggest dev item is the SLURM probe trudging along.  Considering the available effort, it's probably best we keep at just that for a quarter.

---++++OSG

[[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/pub/Accounting/StakehodersMeetingSummary2014Feb/OSG_User_Support_Gratia_Wishlist.pdf][OSG Whishlist]]

*Gratia & OSG Software (__Tim__)*
   * The software development process for the Gratia probes is a mess
      * All probe source code is in a single package
      * All probes must be built together, then build products are partitioned into binary packages
      * One broken probe can hold up updates to all others — have not released update to probes since October
      * There are many probe developers, and yet Tanya gets involved in nearly all updates, at least a little
   * Met on 6 February 2014 to discuss process and improvements
   * Will propose better process and, most likely, subdivision of probe source code soon
   * Also changing developers for OSG Software-owned probes


---++++CMS
From __Burt__: We're swamped right now unfortunately with a lot of Tier 1 work
proceeding and a USCMS S&C review. I don't think we'll be presenting or
attending unfortunately -- sorry!
