   1 Ensure clean and clear separation of code modules between "Gratia, the job accounting system" and "Gratia, the data transport". (See [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/Meeting20100126][details]]) [Philippe]

The following are outstanding known issues that should be addressed have not been scheduled yet
(see https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/SoftwareTools/Meeting20100126 for analysis):

   1 Do the development / re-factoring work necessary to enable a collector to run multiple concurrent !RecordProcessor threads.
   1 Enable multiple collectors to interact with one DB, or multiple DBs using master-master replication or other clustering techniques.
   1 Reports to group by resource_group on request.
   1 Log entries may be in UTC or local time depending on service start order.
   1 Automatic maintenance of Site -- Probe and FQAN/VO -- printable VO name translation via interrogation of OIM.
   1 Gratia is not known to handle non-standard characters safely. <i>Neither the probes nor the collector have been verified to handle non-standard characters safely: components should be verified / updated to handle UTF-8.</i>
   1 Gratia probes can hang if collector goes down hard at a certain stage of communication. Need to research how to add timeout into communication from probe side.
   1 Gratia probes cannot deal with HTTP proxies.  Standard proxy library does not do the job because we
      * Send multiple HTTP envelopes per connection; and
      * Need to be able to do the same over HTTPS.

The following tasks have been completed:

The following are currently not planned on being addressed.

   * Handling on non-latin characters.
   * Improve response time of Status page
   * Automatic table optimization (schedulable, abortable, triggerable) [Insert will be disabled during optimization]
   * Automatic sync of VONameCorrection? table and info OIM.
   * Support change of DN (and match to same Common Name)
   * Test (and fix) multi-thread insert in Innodb
   * Add compression capability to Collector to Collector connection.
   * Ability to upload only summarized record in Collector to Collector replication

   * Add work-around to 2 md5 checksum being equal for non-duplicate records.

   * Persistent selection/exclusion lists for all charts: Listboxes or any other web entry fields for specifying VO's, sites, date range, etc. should maintain the selected values so they can be used across multiple reports.
   * The ui should provide for selecting data for fqan, (wildcarded with regular expression), DN
   * In Reports Date range selection specification should contain the last day, week, month, 6 months and year periods
   * Report displaying the run time profile (distribution) of jobs by Site and VO. Chart or xls format is acceptable. (RR21)
