---+ Measurements and Metrics Graphing (Gratia Web) Development Guide
%TOC{depth="3"}%

Metrics and Measurements provides a web graphing system designed for experts to pull data out of the Gratia system and other data sources.  It is based upon !GraphTool.

---++ Installation

Since the Gratia Web have multiple dependencies, the best way to install it with its dependencies is to install it from the OSG repositories. Please follow the instructions on:
[[Documentation/Release3.InstallGratiaWeb][Install Gratia Web from the OSG repository]]

---++ Development Directions

Gratia Web is composed of 2 different projects whose source code is kept in github, the projects are =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool=.

The source code for =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= is kept here:

   * [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/OSG-Measurements-Metrics][https://github.com/opensciencegrid/OSG-Measurements-Metrics]]

=OSG-Measurements-Metrics= uses =graphtool= to submit database queries and create plots.
 The source code for =graphtool= is kept here:

   * [[https://github.com/opensciencegrid/graphtool][https://github.com/opensciencegrid/graphtool]]

These 2 github projects are also eclipse/!PyDev projects. 

---+++ RPM Build

Both projects contain and RPM building script called =buildrpms.sh= in the base folder of each project. The changelog file is also kept in the base folder of each project with the name =changelog.txt=. 
The RPM builiding configuration is set in different configuration files. 

For =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= these files are:
   * =./setup/setup_basic.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_Db.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_static_graphs.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_Web.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup.cfg=

For =graphtool= these files are:
   * =./setup.cfg=

In this files you can change the release number of the rpm that is going to be built.
<pre class="file">
[bdist_rpm]
...
release = %RED%X%ENDCOLOR%
...
</pre>
*%RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number.*

To rebuild the RPMs run the following from the base folder: 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./buildrpms.sh
</pre>
%NOTE% The path to this directory must not contain any spaces

This will put the new copy of the RPM(s) in =dist/=.  

To clean the temporary directories, created with the previous script, run from the base folder:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-clean.sh
</pre>

---+++ Deploy changes on Development machine

After changes have been made to the project code those changes can be deployed on the development machine running from the base folder of each project:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-deploy.sh %RED%X%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
*Where %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number of the project.*

As well they could be uninstalled running from the base folder of each project:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-uninstall.sh
</pre>

To deploy changes for =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool= at the same time the following script can be used from the base folder of =OSG-Measurements-Metrics=:


<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-deploy-with-graphtool.sh %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% %BLUE%Y%ENDCOLOR% 
</pre>
*Where %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number of OSG-Measurements-Metrics and %BLUE%Y%ENDCOLOR%  is the release number of graphtool.*

%NOTE% Root access will be requested to run these scripts.

%NOTE% graphtool uninstall script will fail if osg-measurements-metrics-db package is still installed on the machine.

%NOTE% =./local-deploy.sh= and =./local-deploy-with-graphtool.sh= will uninstall the current RPMs on the machine, build the required rpms and install them.

---++ Eclipse + !PyDev
---+++ Installation
   1. Verify that you have Java installed
      <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% java -version
*If Java is installed you must get something like:*
java version "1.7.0_75"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (rhel-2.5.4.0.el6_6-x86_64 u75-b13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.75-b04, mixed mode)</pre>
      If Java is not installed, it can be downloaded from [[https://www.java.com][https://www.java.com]].
   1. Download Eclipse from [[https://eclipse.org/][https://eclipse.org/]]

      %NOTE% Any eclipse should work, but the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers is recommended
   1. Open Eclipse (You can create a new workspace or use the default one)
   1. Go to the menu =Help -> Eclipse Marketplace=
   1. Search for !PyDev and install !PyDev (Python IDE for Eclipse)
   1. *(Optional)* Use the marketplace to install !EasyShell, this plug-in will let you open terminals easily for the projects locations you'll work on.
   1. Go to the menu =Window -> Open Perspective -> Other=
   1. Select !PyDev and open it
   1. A prompt will request to configure python
      * If python is installed in the default location select =Quick Autoconfig=
      * If not select =Manual Configuration= and setup python
   1. Go to =Window -> Preferences -> Editors -> Text Editor=
   1. Check the =Show whitespace characters= and =Insert spaces for tabs= and press =OK=
      %WARNING% This will help you avoid errors caused by incorrect indentation  

---+++ Import Python Projects on !PyDev

---++++If you already have a clone of the repository:
   1. Go to the menu =File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace=
   1. Browse and select the base folder of the project you want to import
   1. Select the project you want to open and press =Finish=

---++++If you don't have already a clone of the repository:
   1. Setup your machine to use github with the public key configuration.
   1. Go to the menu =File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git=
   1. Select Clone URI
   1. Insert the clone SSH URI
   1. Select SSH as connection protocol
      %NOTE% User must be git with no password
   1. Select the branches you are going to work on
   1. Select the directory where the repository is going to be cloned in your local machine and press =Next=
   1. Select =Import existing projects= and press =Next=
   1. Check the project you want to import and press =Finish= 

---+++ Running/Debugging with !PyDev
!PyDev projects have source folders. These source folder can be recognized because they have a package symbol over the folder icon in the Package Explorer, and python packages have a package icon instead. All of the source folders in the project are included in the =PYTHONPATH= when running a script from eclipse. 

   * Source Folders and Packages in !PyDev: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/src-pkg.png" alt="src-pkg.png" width='554' height='299' />   

%NOTE% To create a new source folder you can do right click on the project and select =New -> Source Folder=

%NOTE% To create a package in python you must add the new folder and include an =__init__.py= file (even if is an empty file).

%NOTE% To include code in the =PYTHONPATH= that is not included in the project by itself or in the system python libraries you can:
   * Do right click on the project and go to =Properties -> Project References= where you can select other projects that are imported in eclipse to be included in your project =PYTHONPATH=
   * Do right click on the project and go to =Properties -> !PyDev - PYTHONPATH= and setup manually the =PYTHONPATH= 

---++++ Running a Script
   1. Select or open the script you want to run (it must be in a source folder).
   1. Do right click on the script and go to =Run As -> Python Run=.
   1. The console will prompt displaying the output of the script and will give you the option to terminate the script.

%NOTE% If the console does not prompt go to =Window -> Show View -> Console=

---++++ Debugging a Script
   1. Open the script you want to debug
   1. Go to the line of code where you want to start to control the program execution
   1. Over the line number on the left do right click and select =Add Breakpoint=
   1. Do right click on the script and go to =Debug As -> Python Run=.
   1. Wait until the program execution gets to the line where you added the breakpoint
   1. If =Confirm Perspective Switch= is prompt select =Yes=
   1. The Debug Perspective opens and will allow you to control the program execution as well as examine the variable contents

   * !PyDev Variable Explorer: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/Variables.png" alt="Variables.png" width='648' height='304' />    

%NOTE%
Debug controls allow you to:
   * *Step Into (shortcut F5):* If a function is about to be invoked will continue the step-by-step control inside the function definition
   * *Step Over (shortcut F6):* Will continue the step-by-step control in the next line of code of the current script
   * *Step Return (shortcut F7):* Will continue the step-by-step control in the next =return=
   * *Resume (shortcut F8):* Will resume the normal program execution until the next breakpoint
   * *Terminate (shortcut ctrl+F2):* Will terminate the program execution

   * !PyDev debug controls: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/DebugControls.png" alt="DebugControls.png" width='280' height='77' />    
%NOTE%
To return to the !PyDev develpoment perspective click on !PyDev on the upper right corner, or go to the menu =Window -> Open Perspective -> Other= and select !PyDev.

   * !PyDev Quick Perspective Change: <br />
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/PyDevPerspective.png" alt="!PyDevPerspective.png" width='472' height='189' />    

---++ Gratia Web Development with !PyDev
=OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool= are already configured as !PyDev projects. =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= is configured to reference the =graphtool= project to include its code in the =PYTHONPATH=. However the =graphtool= !PyDev project is not required to be imported if the code that need to be modified is included only in =OSG-Measurements-Metrics=. If =graphtool= !PyDev project is imported in your eclipse workspace, when you run a script from the =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= source folder in eclipse, it will include the changes of code that you have on eclipse in the =graphtool= project. To avoid this and use the =graphtool= code installed in your computer you can close the =graphtool= eclipse project. 

Before you run the =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= server from eclipse you will need to adjust the =website-devel.xml= file. This file is located in =src/gratia/config=. Replace the =/home/user/git/OSG-Measurements-Metrics/static= for the absolute path to the =OSG-Measurements-Metrics/static= folder in your machine.
<pre class="file">
&lt;graphtool-config&gt;
...
  &lt;class name="static-site" type="StaticContent"&gt;
    &lt;directory location="/gratia/static-site" name="/gratia/static-site"&gt;/home/user/git/OSG-Measurements-Metrics/static/&lt;/directory&gt;
  &lt;/class&gt;
...
&lt;/graphtool-config&gt;
</pre>

After this go to =src/gratia/tools/gratia_web_dev.py= and run the script from eclipse. This will start the server and will be available from [[http://localhost:8086/gratia][http://localhost:8086/gratia]].

%NOTE% The development server will use the database configuration located at =/etc/DBParam.xml=.
