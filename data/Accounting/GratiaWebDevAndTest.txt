---+ Measurements and Metrics Graphing (Gratia Web) Development Guide
%TOC{depth="3"}%

Metrics and Measurements provides a web graphing system designed for experts to pull data out of the Gratia system and other data sources.  It is based upon !GraphTool.

---++ Installation

Since the Gratia Web have multiple dependencies, the best way to install it with its dependencies is to install it from the OSG repositories. Please follow the instructions on:
[[Documentation/Release3.InstallGratiaWeb][Install Gratia Web from the OSG repository]]

---++ Development Directions

Gratia Web is composed of 2 different projects whose source code is kept in github, the projects are =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool=.

The source code for =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= is kept here:

<verbatim>
https://github.com/opensciencegrid/OSG-Measurements-Metrics
</verbatim>

=OSG-Measurements-Metrics= uses =graphtool= to submit database queries and create plots.
 The source code for =graphtool= is kept here:

<verbatim>
https://github.com/opensciencegrid/graphtool
</verbatim>

These 2 github projects are also eclipse/PyDev projects. 

---+++ RPM Build

Both prjects contain and RPM building script called =buildrpms.sh= in the base folder of each project. The changelog file is also kept in the base folder of each project with the name =changelog.txt=. 
The RPM builiding configuration is set in different configuration files. 

For =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= these files are:
   * =./setup/setup_basic.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_Db.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_static_graphs.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_Web.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup.cfg=

For =graphtool= these files are:
   * =./setup.cfg=

In this files you can change the release number of the rpm that is going to be built.
<pre class="file">
[bdist_rpm]
...
release = %RED%X%ENDCOLOR%
...
</pre>
<b>%RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number.</b>

To rebuild the RPMs run the following from the base folder: 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./buildrpms.sh
</pre>
%NOTE% The path to this directory must not contain any spaces

This will put the new copy of the RPM(s) in =dist/=.  

To clean the temporary directories, created with the previous script, run from the base folder:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-clean.sh
</pre>

---+++ Deploy changes on Development machine

After changes have been made to the project code those changes can be deployed on the development machine running from the base folder of each project:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-deploy.sh %RED%X%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
<b>Where %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number of the project.</b>

As well they could be uninstalled running from the base folder of each project:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-uninstall.sh
</pre>

To deploy changes for =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool= at the same time the following script can be used from the base folder of =OSG-Measurements-Metrics=:


<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-deploy-with-graphtool.sh %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% %BLUE%Y%ENDCOLOR% 
</pre>
<b>Where %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number of OSG-Measurements-Metrics and %BLUE%Y%ENDCOLOR%  is the release number of graphtool.</b>

%NOTE% Root acces will be requested to run these scripts.

%NOTE% graphtool uninstall script will fail if osg-measurements-metrics-db package is still installed on the machine.

%NOTE% =./local-deploy.sh= and =./local-deploy-with-graphtool.sh= will uninstall the current RPMs on the machine, build the required rpms and install them.

---++ Eclipse + PyDev
---+++ Installation
   1. Verify that you have Java installed
      <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% java -version
<b>If Java is installed you must get something like:</b>
java version "1.7.0_75"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (rhel-2.5.4.0.el6_6-x86_64 u75-b13)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.75-b04, mixed mode)</pre>
      If Java is not installed, it can be downloaded from [[https://www.java.com][https://www.java.com]].
   1. Download Eclipse from [[https://eclipse.org/][https://eclipse.org/]]
   1. Open Eclipse (You can create a new workspace or use the default one)
   1. Go to the menu =Help -> Eclipse Marketplace=
   1. Search for PyDev and install PyDev (Python IDE for Eclipse)
   1. <b>(Optional)</b> Use the marketplace to install EasyShell, this plug-in will let you open terminals easily for the projects locations you'll work on.
   1. Go to the menu =Window -> Open Perspective -> Other=
   1. Select PyDev and open it
   1. A prompt will request to configure python
      * If python is installed in the default location select =Quick Autoconfig=
      * If not select =Manual Configuration= and setup python
   1. Go to =Window -> Preferences -> Editors -> Text Editor=
   1. Check the =Show whitespace characters= and =Insert spaces for tabs= and press =OK=
      %WARNING% This will help you avoid errors caused by incorrect indentation  

---+++ Import Python Projects on PyDev

---++++If you already have a clone of the repository:
   1. Go to the menu =File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace=
   1. Browse and select the base folder of the project you want to import
   1. Select the project you want to open and press =Finish=

---++++If you don't have already a clone of the repository:
   1. Setup your machine to use github with the public key configuration.
   1. Go to the menu =File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git=
   1. Select Clone URI
   1. Insert the clone SSH URI
   1. Select SSH as connection protocol
      %NOTE% User must be git with no password
   1. Select the branches you are going to work on
   1. Select the directory where the repository is going to be cloned in your local machine and press =Next=
   1. Select =Import existing projects= and press =Next=
   1. Check the project you want to import and press =Finish= 

---+++ Running/Debugging with PyDev
PyDev projects have source folders. These source folder can be recognized because they have a package symbol over the folder icon in the Package Explorer, and python packages have a package icon instead. All of the projects PyDev source folders are included in the =PYTHONPATH= when running a script from eclipse. 

%NOTE% To create a new source folder you can do right click on the project and select =New -> Source Folder=

%NOTE% To create a package in python you must add the new folder and include an =__init__.py= file (even if is an empty file).

%NOTE% To include code in the =PYTHONPATH= that is not included in the project by itself you can:
   * Do right click on the project and go to =Properties -> Project References= where you can select other projects that are imported in eclipse to be included in your project =PYTHONPATH=
   * Do right click on the project and go to =Properties -> PyDev - PYTHONPATH= and setup manually the =PYTHONPATH= 

---++++ Running a Script
   1. Select or open the script you want to run (it must be in a source folder).
   1. Do right click on the script and go to =Run As -> Python Run=.
   1. The console will prompt displaying the output of the script and will give you the option to terminate the script.

%NOTE% If the console does not prompt go to =Window -> Show View -> Console=

---++++ Debugging a Script
