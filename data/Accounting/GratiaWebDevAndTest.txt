---+ Measurements and Metrics Graphing (Gratia Web) Development Guide
%TOC{depth="3"}%

Metrics and Measurements provides a web graphing system designed for experts to pull data out of the Gratia system and other data sources.  It is based upon !GraphTool.

---++ Installation

Since the Gratia Web have multiple dependencies, the best way to install it with its dependencies is to install it from the OSG repositories. Please follow the instructions on:
[[Documentation/Release3.InstallGratiaWeb][Install Gratia Web from the OSG repository]]

---++ Development Directions

Gratia Web is composed of 2 different projects whose source code is kept in github, the projects are =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool=.

The source code for =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= is kept here:

<verbatim>
https://github.com/opensciencegrid/OSG-Measurements-Metrics
</verbatim>

=OSG-Measurements-Metrics= uses =graphtool= to submit database queries and create plots.
 The source code for =graphtool= is kept here:

<verbatim>
https://github.com/opensciencegrid/graphtool
</verbatim>

These 2 github projects are also eclipse/PyDev projects. 

---+++ RPM Build

Both prjects contain and RPM building script called =buildrpms.sh= in the base folder of each project. The changelog file is also kept in the base folder of each project with the name =changelog.txt=. 
The RPM builiding configuration is set in different configuration files. 

For =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= these files are:
   * =./setup/setup_basic.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_Db.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_static_graphs.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup_Web.cfg=
   * =./setup/setup.cfg=

For =graphtool= these files are:
   * =./setup.cfg=

In this files you can change the release number of the rpm that is going to be built.
<pre class="file">
[bdist_rpm]
...
release = %RED%X%ENDCOLOR%
...
</pre>
<b>%RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number.</b>

To rebuild the RPMs run the following from the base folder: 
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./buildrpms.sh
</pre>
%NOTE% The path to this directory must not contain any spaces

This will put the new copy of the RPM(s) in =dist/=.  

To clean the temporary directories, created with the previous script, run from the base folder:
<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-clean.sh
</pre>

---+++ Deploy changes on Development machine

After changes have been made to the project code those changes can be deployed on the development machine running from the base folder of each project:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-deploy.sh %RED%X%ENDCOLOR%
</pre>
<b>Where %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number of the project.</b>

As well they could be uninstalled running from the base folder of each project:

<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-uninstall.sh
</pre>

To deploy changes for =OSG-Measurements-Metrics= and =graphtool= at the same time the following script can be used from the base folder of =OSG-Measurements-Metrics=:


<pre class="screen">
%UCL_PROMPT%./local-deploy-with-graphtool.sh %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% %BLUE%Y%ENDCOLOR% 
</pre>
<b>Where %RED%X%ENDCOLOR% is the release number of OSG-Measurements-Metrics and %BLUE%Y%ENDCOLOR%  is the release number of graphtool.</b>

%NOTE% Root acces will be requested to run these scripts.

%NOTE% graphtool uninstall script will fail if osg-measurements-metrics-db package is still installed on the machine.

%NOTE% =./local-deploy.sh= and =./local-deploy-with-graphtool.sh= will uninstall the current RPMs on the machine, build the required rpms and install them.

---+++ Eclipse + PyDev
   1. Verify that you have Java installed
      <pre class="screen">%UCL_PROMPT% java -version
<b>If Java is installed you must get something like:</b>
%UCL_PROMPT% java version "1.7.0_75"
%UCL_PROMPT% OpenJDK Runtime Environment (rhel-2.5.4.0.el6_6-x86_64 u75-b13)
%UCL_PROMPT% OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.75-b04, mixed mode)</pre>
      If Java is not installed, it can be downloaded from [[https://www.java.com][https://www.java.com]].
