---++Action items from previous meeting.

---++DB and Schema issues.

Diana: I would like to learn how to use zrm.  

Philippe: Let's meet on Friday morning.

Diana: There is an audit on DB access going on.  What is the procedure for cutting of access.  

Chris: Write access to the DB is only allowed on the FNAL sites/vpn.

---++OSG Issues.

Passing the operation of Brian's metrics and misc to 'Gratia Operation'

Keith: I doubt that Brian's code is ready to be passed over to operation.

John W.: Yes there is you report part but we also have the capacity/normalization factor gathering code that Gratia is relying on to report to WLCG.

Brian: yes we can separate the script needed for normalization.

Brian:  Better summary of exit code.

Philippe: Planned for OSG 0.34

---++Collector.

Philippe: Since we remove the use of the Date function in the where clause, the MySQL views seems to perform
as well as direct queries, hence we can think about reducing the number of summary tables and increase the 
number of 'views'.  Pending performance test.

Chris: I think we can avoid dealing with the stored procedure until after the 0.34 release.

---++Report development.

Penelope: Added interface to have csv file along the static reports.  We need feedback on which report to actually put there.
This is somewhat a replacement for Ruth's static reports request.

---++Probe.

---++Test Bed.

---++Any Other Business.

---++To be discussed later.
