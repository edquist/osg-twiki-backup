---++OSG Accounting Services - Gratia - Probe Installation

---+++OSG ITB "quick start" installation

<OL>
<LI />Install the correct probe for your batch farm: see examples below for the most common installs of the [[#CondorProbeQuickStart][Condor]] or [[#PbsLsfProbeQuickStart][PBS/LSF]] probes, or see the detailed and comprehensive instructions below.
<LI />If you are installing the Condor probe and received a warning to install the patches to the GRAM !JobManager modules, follow the [[ProbeConfigCondor#GratiaCondorGramPatchManual][patch instructions]]
<LI />Configure your [[ProbeConfigCondor#ProbeConfig][Condor]] or PBS/LSF (=[[ProbeConfigPbsLsf#ProbeConfig][ProbeConfig]]= and =[[ProbeConfigPbsLsf#UrCollectorConf][urCollector.conf]]=) probe.
</OL>

---+++Installation using pacman

The Gratia condor probe in particular is available from VDT using pacman:

<verbatim>pacman -get Gratia-Condor-Probe</verbatim>

%RED%*HOWEVER*%ENDCOLOR%: this package may not be available for your version of VDT. Gratia probes for the condor, PBS and LSF batch systems may be installed via RPMS as described below. Please see the [[ProbeConfigCondor#GratiaCondorGramPatch][installation notes for the condor probe]] though, as it requires versions of VDT prior to 1.5.1 to be patched for operation with versions of Condor prior to v6.9.0. 

---+++Installation from RPM

---++++Preliminary notes

   * If you install any probe at all, you will need the =gratia-probe-common= RPM listed below; this contains common infrastructure required by all probes.

   * The Gratia Condor currently requires that $VDT_LOCATION/gratia/var/data points to the same directory as the directory mentioned in the =!DataFolder= variable of the Gratia Condor probe's ProbeConfig file.

   * Depending on your batch system, you should install the appropriate Condor or PBS/LSF probe on your CE. If you are running both batch systems, you should install both probes.

   * Read the configuration notes for each probe you install.

   * If you require the extra granularity of process accounting (unlikely except in rare circumstances), you should install the ps-accounting probe on the CE *and* every worker node. This is a re-incarnation of a legacy FNAL admin utility and as such is only likely to be of use to FNAL admins.

   * Note that the =gratia-probe-common= RPM contains example probes, =samplemeter.{py,pl}=. If you wish to write or customize your own probe, please take a look at the [[ProbeConfigGeneral][general configuration notes]]. For specific probes, see the appropriate notes for that probe as listed in the table below.

Then, install the RPMS. Note that the main install prefix may be changed with this addition to the =rpm= command line: =--relocate&nbsp;/opt/vdt/gratia=/desired/path=. It is recommended to use, for example:
