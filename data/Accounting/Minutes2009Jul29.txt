However, if the job is suspended (I think really only Wisconsin does this on the OSG), the start time isn't reset because the job isn't really reset.  These suspended jobs appeared to count for a small percentage (2% of Wisconsin's time).

Talked with Dan again - Ruth's first characterization is closer to correct.  Condor reports the wall time of the application while it was running - so it at least doesn't "bill" for while the application was preempted.

The options are:
0) Keep the current.  This is fair to the user - they can see which sites they are getting better throughput from.  If it takes me 15 hours of runtime to get 1 hour of CPU time done, I want to know.
1) Only use the wall time for the last run of the job, so the CPU / Wall becomes "fair" to sites that preempt.
2) Alter condor's behavior so Gratia reports the cumulative CPU time divided by the cumulative wall time.

(0) makes sites that preempt unhappy.  (1) means that you "lose" wall hours (i.e., if you have 10 cores 100% occupied for 10 hours, you might only have 90 total wall hours due to preemptions.).  I believe (2) is best for the OSG to report.  I talked to Dan about making the change to condor to record cumulative CPU time over all the job attempts.

I count two definitions of CPU efficiency:
1) CPU efficiency of the application.  This is the amount of CPU time the application uses per unit of wall time.
2) CPU efficiency of the execution (which includes preemptions).  This is the amount of CPU time the application used for a successful run at the site over the amount of time it was running.  I believe Condor folks refer to this as the "goodput".

I think I might have once suggested that we add a column so we could measure both efficiency and goodput.
