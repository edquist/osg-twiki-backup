---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Status of the release.

---++Hardware estimate.
Steve estimates $5K for a parallel server to gratia06, however
this would remove needed dollars from the gratia hardware budget which 
may be needed later to expand disk space to keep a single database on 
a single machine.  Priorities need to be understood.

Questions about why we need a replica.  Is there a non-blocking replication strategy? We think the mysql replication as used in FermiGridHA will work but needs to be tested at the scale of the gratia DB.  Replication only needs to be one way. Will only 
have one machine inserting at once.

Would we replicate all tables or just the summary tables?  Advantages of replicating
all tables is that we have a "hot" backup available if necessary, also it is 
helpful to have Resources information to correlate with the JobUsageRecord
and also to correct missed VO information.
