%STARTINCLUDE%
---++ Gratia Services Release 2007/10/26
---+++ Release Notes
This release (v0-28) incorporates the following changes and updates ...
<dl>
<dt>Since the last VDT release ()</dt>
<dd></dd>
<dt>Since the last version running on the production servers ()</dt>
<dd>
   1 Upgrade to a new version of the report viewer.
      * Upgrade from Birt V2.0 to V2.2.1
   1 Support for handshaking
</dd>
<dt>Since VDT 1.6.1 ()</dt>
<dd></dd>
</dl>

---+++ Anticipated downtime
It is expected that this release will require the Gratia services and reporting to be unavailable for approximately 10 hours.  

The upgrade will begin at 16:00 CDT on 10/26/2007 (Friday).

The changes affecting downtime  for this release are:
   1 Addition of a column in the <nop>JobUsageRecord_Meta table.
   1 The necessity of recreating all the summary tables due to the addition of the new table.

As a side note, it is anticipated that downtime for future releases will be minimal as a new procedure will be used when lengthy database conversion are necessary.  It cannot be down for this release as the necessary hardware is not yet in place.

---+++ Collectors and Databases Affected

The following Gratia collectors and databases will be converted with this release:
%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF"}%
%EDITTABLE{  header="|*Database*|*URL*|*Description*|" format="| text, 20 | text, 20 | text, 35 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x25 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|*Database*|*<nop>MySql port*|*Collector URL*|*Collector host*|*Description*|
| fermi_itb |  |  |  |  |
| fermi_osg |  |  |  |  |
| gratia | gratia-db01.fnal.gov:3320 | gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880 | gratia09.fnal.gov |  |
| gratia_itb | gratia-db01.fnal.gov:3320 | gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8881 | gratia09.fnal.gov |  |

The following Gratia collectors and databases will __NOT__  be converted with this release.  These repositories contained specialized reports that have not as yet been upgraded to the new Birt V2..2.1 software. __However__ , they will be taken out-of-service while the other databases are being updated.
%TABLE{ tableborder="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1" headerbg="#99CCCC" databg="#FFFFCC, #FFFFFF"}%
%EDITTABLE{  header="|*Database*|*URL*|*Description*|" format="| text, 20 | text, 20 | text, 35 | text, 15 | textarea, 3x25 |"  changerows="on" quietsave="on" editbutton="Edit table" }%
|*Database*|*<nop>MySql port*|*Collector URL*|*Collector host*|*Description*|
| gratia_psacct |  |  |  |  |

---+++ Conversion steps
This release involves a database schema change on the <nop>JobUsageRecord_Meta table, it is expected to take a significant amount of time on the production _gratia_ data base.  
In order to minimize the overload that is certain to occur if we were to stop the Gratia collectors from accepting data from the probes, the Gratia collectors will only be taken down for a short period while the database is being backed up.

<ol>
<li>Shutdown and database backup.
  <ol type="a">
     <li>On __gratia-db01__, comment out the _mysqlhotcopy_ cron entry
      <pre class="screen">
43 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/mysqlhotcopy_cron.sh > /var/log/mysqlhotcopy.out 2>&1 
      </pre>
     </li>

     <li> __For ALL of the databases (inlcuding those not be upgraded)__ , stop the Gratia update services.%BR%
            - In your browser,  connect to the Gratia administrative services url for each of the databases.%BR%
            - Select the _System / Adminstration_ menu option in the left menu%BR%
            - Then scroll down to the _Starting/Stopping Database Update Services_ section and select the _Stop Update Services_ link.
      </li>

     <li> __On each collector/tomcat host__ , _stop_ the tomcat service for __ALL__ Gratia collectors.
      <pre class="screen">
On gratia09:
  service tomcat-gratia stop
  service tomcat-itb stop
  service tomcat-osg_daily stop
  service tomcat-osg_integration stop

On gratia08:
  service tomcat-xxxx stop
      </pre>
      </li>
   </ol>
   
<li>Take a standard tree copy of the mysqldb tree on %CURRENT_MYSQL% and copy it to %NEW_MYSQL% </li>

<li>Startup *ALL* collectors on %CURRENT_TOMCAT%.%ENDCOLOR%</li>


<li>On %NEW_MYSQL%, convert all tables to INNODB, timing the exercise.</li>
<li>Test to see if the new !InnoDB database can successfully be backed up via !TiBS and recovered</li>

</ol>

<li>For the new Gratia Collector/Reporting Tomcat services:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li>Install a new Gratia collector on %NEW_TOMCAT%.</li>
<li>Connect the  new collector/reporter (%NEW_TOMCAT%) to the converted !MySql DB (%NEW_MYSQL%).</li>
</ol>

<li> Test the collector and reporting services on the new instances (%NEW_TOMCAT%, %NEW_MYSQL%) based on the details in the [[#Testing_the_conversion][Testing the conversion section of this document]].</li>

</ol>

---++++ Gratia Collector/Reporting Conversion
<ol>
<li>Announce a downtime for the production collector long enough to allow the completion of steps [[#StepNum05][5]] through [[#StepNum09][9]].</li>

<li>Set up a replication process from the production collector to the temporary collector, with DBID carefully set to only replicate records
received since DB copy (manual DB interaction).</li>

<li>Stop updates to the production DB and shut down the production collector after allowing replication to the temporary collector to complete.</li>

<li>Remove the replication (manual DB interaction).</li>

<li>Shut down the temporary collector after it has received the last replicated records from the production collector and take a note of the latest DBID (manual DB interaction) in the usage records on the temporary DB.</li>

<li>Upgrade the production collector.</li>

<li>Connect the production collector to the converted DB and bring it back up to receive data.</li>
</ol>



---+++ Testing the conversion
---++++ Reporting
Testing of the Gratia reporting and administration services is  a manual process exercising the various reports/drill downs on all screens. This should be done in 2 stages:
<ol>
<li>Testing the basic functionality</li>
<ul>
<li>This should be done before the testing of the [[#Collector_Probes][Collector/Probes testing]].  </li>
<li>   </li>
</ul>
</ol>

---++++ Collector/Probes
Testing of the Gratia collectors can be performed by activating the Job Usage and Metric Replication services on the production server (%CURRENT_TOMCAT%) for all database schema.
