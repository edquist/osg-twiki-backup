"I would like to add as a "TODO" for the next Gratia meeting to provide guidance (from the Gratia developer) to OSG about what metrics we could monitor (maybe the queue size?) which would give us an indication of the health of the collectors."

OSG requests 3 type of alarms: 
   * When the collector stop taking input from the probe
      * The closest approximation is to check if the queue has more than 80 000 files.   The collector stops taking input when it reaches 100000 and restart when it is below 80000.
   * When the rate of record processing is too low to be handle to handle the input rate
      * this would be when the number of file in the queue is greater than 80 000 files and the number of record processed in the last hour is less than ( average number of record per day ) / 24
   * When the data is far out of date.
      * The best approximation would be:
<verbatim>if ( file_in_queue < 80000) 
    time_back = (number of records in queue)  / ( average number of record per day )
else if (average number of records per day ) > ( number of record processed in last day) 
    time_back = ( (average number of records per day ) - ( number of record processed in last day) ) / ( average number of record per day )
else 
    # if we have a queue __and__ we already processed more than the average number of records for today then we assume we 
    # have one of the busiest day.
    time_back = ( (max number of records per day ) - ( number of record processed in last day) ) / ( average number of record per day )
 </verbatim>
