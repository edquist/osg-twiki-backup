---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Release Status

John W.: 1. v0.34 testing
   a. Still finding conditions in the admin login that required resolution.
   a. Still need to package cron reports
   a. Still need to change configure_gratia for VDT or at least dentify changes needed
   a. Still need to identify/verify changes to VDT packaging instructions
   a. VDT mysql database is using a single tablespace for InnoDB tables.  Need to find where the my.cnf file is located and determine how to fix it.
   a. Finished the script (voms-servers.sh) that will create the voms-server file needed for the admin login when using the FQAN as the login criteria.
   a. Cleaned up the comments in the configure-service.properties file related to the admin login.  Also set the default configuration to ALLOW ALL.
   a. Still need to create an admin login documentation page to show in the left menu.
   a. Removed the gratia-security war/webapps service from the build as it is now a jar file included in the services needing it.  Changed the vomssecurrity target to be called just the security target as before.

---++DB and Schema issues

John W: The gratia-vm02 database has a problem with using a single tablespace 
for the InnoDB tables.     These need to be converted.  Have not gotten to this.  Briefly 
looked at scripts found
     here: http://www.saturn.in/gpl/mysql.html.  These do need some 
modification or we create our own.

John W:.Found the reason why we keep getting a new user defined in the 
mysql.user table as
    gratia@% with no password.  This causes one to fail on login 
attempts as user gratia as it
    collates up first when MySql is verifying logins.
   
    It is the  "GRANT SELECT ON mysql.proc TO gratia;" in the 
create_build-stored-procedures-sql
    script.  When doing this MySql automatically creates the user if it 
doesn't exist.

    Since this is needed only for local development we need to find an 
alternative way of doing this.
    Have not come close to resolving this.

---++WLCG

John W: APEL interface
   a. Had call with Karthik and Horst on 5/6 to bring him on board with the interface.  Pointed him to the doc and source code.  Will get back on this when we release 0.34
   a. Created some new queries/output for Brian to look at use.  They are here, with a prefix of         wlcg-org in name: http://home.fnal.gov/~weigand/apel-wlcg/ .  These are showing the         org_Tier1/2 APEL tables so that the pledge vs actual report can  show what comprises a         Tier 1/2 site in the event that is the reason for bad results.
   a. Investigated why the Purdue sites have stopped reporting.  Purdue_Lear is now becoming        Purdue_Steele.  They will be using a new probe name so that both will exist in Gratia and        in WLCG.  We still don't know the procedure for implementing this change in WLCG.        This type of thing makes it important for us to change the interface to function with        effectively dates for sites and normalization factors which will not be easy.
