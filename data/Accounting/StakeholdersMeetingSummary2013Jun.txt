Ruth:


As part of making Accounting/gratia a strategic SCD program and project, I would like to establish a page about Gratia on Fermitools
https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/fermitools/wiki

I would like you to communicate the goals and activities to date of the new web based Fermilab dashboard to the stakeholders in general  - or the Fermilab stakeholder should do this as part of the road table.

Also – I would like us to go through the recommendations from the review and see their status/further feeding..

Accounting needs on GPCF

Background:

  GPCF is the "common facility" managed to best provide computing resources.
  There are several types of resources:
   * Bare Nodes: entire machines dedicated to a single function or user group
   * VM Hosts: platform supporting VMs
   *  Worker Nodes: a computing resource for a small local batch system
   *  VMs: virtual machines dedicated to a single function or user group

For this set of machines, the matrix of desired accounting information
follows.  Note that some items listed are "configuration properties" of
the machine as opposed to "metrics", but are useful to collect metrics
of similarly purposed machines.


Metric                     Bare Nodes   VM Hosts  Worker Nodes   VMs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Authorized user groups         X

Available CPU resources        X           X          X           X

Overall CPU usage              X           X          X           X

Per user CPU usage             X                      X           X

Overall active VMs                         X

Per group active VMs                       X

Per VM CPU usage                           X

This is basically psacct information, with a few pieces requiring
interaction with the VM host system.

Ideally additional information on memory utilization and I/O would
be useful, but may not be practical to obtain.

   1. if we can simplify gratia and increase it's reliability/maintainability, I would support that! 
   1. We're moving to SLURM more pervasively, so support for it (we've contributed a probe) is important to HCC. 
   1. Also, we are interested in utilizing ProjectName to track particular funded projects.  I believe that's on us -- the hooks are all there.  I am not sure if it's straightforward to utilize it via SLURM -- perhaps, however, that too is on us. (!) 
   1, Is gratia-reporting used?  If not, can it be retired?
   1. A simplified PBS probe would be nice, but HCC is eliminated PBS.  Condo of condos is rumored to be using PBS Pro, however -- perhaps worth revising this. 
   1. We're still interested in non-CPU metrics -- I have to check how viable RAM and storage accounting is, and whether it's on us or ...
