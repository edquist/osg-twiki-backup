---+ Analysis for the inclusion of new types of visualizations in Gratia Web 

The current release of Gratia Web uses the graphtool library to query, transform and plot data retreived from a SQL database. Gratia Web uses XML files to define the database connections, the queries, the input of the queries, the transformations that should be applied to the results, and the desired kind of plot. The render process for the plots is done on the server side using matplotlib and returning a png file that is included in the result page. However, javascript based plotting libraries, like [[https://developers.google.com/chart/][Google Charts]], can provide the users additional functionalities including animations, tooltips, and dynamic exploration of data in a visual way.

the user should see a similar page with parameters and query details, the plot area will have the new static or interactive plot (instead of the png image) 
can this be achieved? 
can it be done in more than one way? 
which part of the code will be reused? 
what will need to be added/changed? 
will the plot configuration be similar? 
how long do you think will take? 
is it worth or is the cost similar to write something from scratch?
