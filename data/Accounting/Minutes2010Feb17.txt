---+Action items from previous meeting:

---+Release Status

---+Services Operation

---++OSG/Fermi

   * Outage this morning due to FCC power problems.
   * OSG Gratia DB copy to take place Thu. IP switch to take place next Thu.

---++RSV

---+OSG Issues

   * Duplicate detection problems for Brian with CE and SE records -- state changes count as duplicates if one goes back to a state one has seen before. Removing duplicate checking from collector code in the short term -- more thought required.
   * Brian following up on report inconsistencies within CMS.
   * Moves to implement a form of change management with respect to OSG software. 

---+WLCG 

   * Changes to DB access required for next week's OSG hardware switch. Chris will handle.

---+Fermi/CD

---+Developments

---++BOINC probe (Sebastian G.)

---++Report Trash/Trash/Trash/Trash/Extensions(Karthik).

From Karthik via email:
<blockquote>
   * The bigint work stands at the point where the 100% manual upgrade (stand alone) works. This needs to be integrated yet with DatabaseMaintenance.

   * I need to re-visit the changes to the hibernate config files, since some of the bigint changes there aren't necessary and have to be reverted

   * The current work in progress I am doing for gratia is the updating of the reports so that the test on Site names are case !INsensitive. The bigint work is on a pause mode right now due to this and few other things I had to work on other non-gratia tasks.

---++FNAL/Nebraska extension proposal (Brian)

---++Testing framework (Aaron)

From Aaron via email:
<blockquote>
I've tested and submitted the test script to Alain on Wednesday, and it's properly performing what Alain has requested:
   1 generating a globus job and executing it
   1 triggering cron job to reporting to the collector host
   1 verifying with the collector host that accounting information has been received

I've also added tests to check for:
   1 Globus job failing on local site
   1 Globus job failing to return proper jobid
   1 Interference from root's cron job (deleting temporarily generated history.XXXX.0 file
   1 Collector host not responding

Am still working on bringing atlas008.uta.edu up (everything is working now, except that it's still not picking up condor queued jobs). Will perform more tests (and try adding more test cases) once atlas008.uta.edu and gratiax14.fnal.gov are fully functional again.
