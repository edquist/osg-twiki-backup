---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++Release v1.0 patches

Chris: v1.0 (+patches) is now in VDT and ready to moved to the main cache for the next release of VDT 1.10ish

Chris: The Main Gratia database has reached its cruising size.  Backup takes only 3hours and 4.5Gb. 

---++OSG Issues

Brian: Top issues is the documentation of the "how", "when" and "what" Gratia can collect information.

Chris:  I am eager to start re-gathering this information.

Brian: There is an issue with RSV not having access to the latest Collector code

Chris:  The version that is  now in the VDT is good for them.

Brian/Chris: Last week issue with RSV is that there are using a verison of Gratia pre-innodb (and
missing some indices).

Brian/Chris: The Gratia is no longer planning/expecting to write the RSV probe for the Gratia Service.

---++Gratia Service

Dan: gratia-vm02 has migrated.  Next is the migration of the DB ...
