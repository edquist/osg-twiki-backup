---++Action items from previous meeting:

---++v0.34 Releases.

Integration test found several issues (most already fixed) including an unresolved problem under heavy load.

Need to all 3 types of collectors: Job Level, Storage, Psacct and daylies.

Steve: Dan Y and Chris should be working next week in separating the ITB to a different hardware.

---++OSG Issues

Brian: - Summary collector work continues.  LIGO data looks good, CMS data is  
a bit problematic (it appears that the collector is blacklisting the  
usage records...).  Still not ready for production.

- Ted H. will be attending the ITB meeting to get more folks turning  
on the Gratia Storage Probes.
    - If that's successful, I will be asking CMS sites to do this next Tuesday.
    - Conclusion: More storage data is coming!

- Friendly reminders for:
   - Appearance of exit codes in summary data
   - Appearance of storage summary data
I believe both are listed in the requirements, and I believe both are  
0.36 items

- Need to discuss reporting strategies for storage data.
    - Email summaries until summary tables are ready?

---++System Admin

Requisition for hardware items is in "special approvers" at CD
(already signed by Vicky, on its way out of division).

Renewed certs for gratia03 and gratiax31-x35, gratiax51,gratiax52, 
gratia05, gratia-vm02.

Got certs for the first time for gratia08, gratia09

Helped John W. debug why glite trust manager wouldn't start up
on one of the gratia08 tomcats ( had to restart after new certs were
installed).

Need a downtime on gratia03 at some point (sometime between June 1 and 
10) to fix lvm.
