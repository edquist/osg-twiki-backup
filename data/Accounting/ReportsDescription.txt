---++ Description of Accounting Reports
This page will make an attempt to describe/explain the accounting reports that are part of the gratia account reporting mechanism. Gratia accounting collects data from various grid resources and populates them into a database. This data is then used to generate reports that are sent to end users, site admins, management and stakeholders. These reports form an important part of the gratia accounting mechanism in the sense it provides a quick summary of the big picture of Grid Accounting. These reports have a significant impact in terms of understanding the accountability of resources, how efficiently these resources are being utilized, by whom, when and much more. 

<font color=red>Remove later</font>. This is indeed about the content of trunk/reporting/summary, in addition to daily and range, you would need to record the perl reports (all-sites-oim all-vos-oim
failure-by-vo-site osg-users).
