---++ Description of Accounting Reports
This page will make an attempt to describe/explain the accounting reports that are part of the gratia account reporting mechanism. Gratia accounting collects data from various grid resources and populates them into a database. This data is then used to generate reports that are sent to end users, site admins, management and stakeholders. These reports form an important part of the gratia accounting mechanism in the sense it provides a quick summary of the big picture of Grid Accounting. These reports have a significant impact in terms of understanding the accountability of resources, how efficiently these resources are being utilized, by whom, when and much more. 

All the scripts that generate and email the report are contained in the gratia trunk/reporting/summary. The main scripts are the daily and range. Also involved are the  perl reports (all-sites-oim, all-vos-oim, failure-by-vo-site, osg-users).

---+++Report from the job level Gratia db for a specific date

This is a daily report that interested users could receive. This report provides the job level accounting information from the Gratia database. To start with, this report provides a big picture summary of the job based accounting information based on sites and then provides multiple sub reports that contain the OSG usage summary statistics for the jobs that finished on the given date. The OSG usage summary is based on different permutations and combinations of sites and VOs.
