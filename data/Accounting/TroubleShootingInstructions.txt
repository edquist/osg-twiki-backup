---++OSG Accounting Services - Gratia - Troubleshooting notes

You have probably been sent here by an email or GOC ticket that said something like ...

<hr />
<verbatim>
Dear %%%SITE%%% site manager,

Your site has been determined to be at OSG version 0.6.0 or
higher, but according to our checks on %%%CHECK_DATE%%% does not appear
to be reporting properly to the official OSG Gratia accounting server,
http://opensciencegrid.org:8880/.

Having a Gratia probe associated with the batch systems you have running
properly installed and reporting is required for OSG gatekeepers of
version 0.6.0 or greater.

Any probes we have seen in recent months associated with %%%SITE%%% are
listed below along with their last-seen date from the point of view of
the Gratia accounting collector:

### Begin probe list
%%%PROBE_LIST%%%
### End probe list

If this list contains entries that are no longer relevant, please let us
know and we will mark that probe inactive in our records.

If probes in this list are intended to be reporting, please follow the
trouble-shooting instructions at:

https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Accounting/TroubleShootingInstructions

If the probe list is empty or does not include a probe for every batch
system (Condor, SGE, PBS or LSF) you run on your gatekeeper, please
install the appropriate package:

### Begin commands
. $VDT_LOCATION/seutp.sh
pacman -get Gratia-<probe>-Probe
$VDT_LOCATION/vdt/setup/configure_gratia --probe <probe-type> \
 --probe-cron --report-to gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880
vdt-control --on gratia-<probe-type>
### End commands

... where "<probe>" is "Condor", "SGE", "PBS" or "LSF" and
"<probe-type>" is the lower case version of "<probe>"

Then, check your configuration with the gratia-site-test script
available from the trouble-shooting page linked above.

Thank you for your time and help,

Chris Green for the OSG Gratia Team.

Please run the attached [[%ATTACHURL%/gratia-site-diag][diagnostics script]] (system privilege not necessary) and follow its instructions to fix your reporting problem (system privilege required to execute fix commands). If you encounter problems or need more information, please correspond by replying to the email you were sent to ensure correct record-keeping with any open tickets.

In order to verify that your site is now reporting correctly, please wait until the relevant probe is no longer running (some probes may churn through a large local backlog before uploading records) before visiting the status page for your site: http://gratia.opensciencegrid.org:8880/gratia-administration/monitor-status.html?sitename=my%20site%20name.

Please notify us if we may close the issue or if further work is warranted. If you have feedback on the troubleshooting instructions either generally or as they may (or may not) have applied to your particular case, please let us know either as part of the ticket or to [[mailto:gratia-operation@fnal.gov][gratia-operation@fnal.gov]].
