%BR% The following Gratia collectors and databases will __NOT__ be converted with this release. These repositories contained specialized reports that have not as yet been upgraded to the new Birt V2.2 software. __However__, they will be taken out-of-service while the other databases are being updated.%BR%

<!-- BUILD DISTRIBUTION -------------------- -->
---+ Build the %CURRENT_RELEASE% for distribution
   1 Make sure your build area contains all _committed_ changes. 
      * cvs update
   1 In _gratia/build-scripts/Makefile_ , change the _version_default_ to: 
      * version_default = %NEXT_DEVEL_VERSION%
      * commit the change
   1 Tag the release (for all committed changes): 
      * cvs rtag -R %RELEASE_TAG% gratia
   1 _Into a *new* area_, export the tagged release: 
      * cvs export -d gratia-%CURRENT_RELEASE% -r %RELEASE_TAG% gratia
   1 Build it for the release (this insures that tar files are produced for VDT): 
      * cd gratia-%CURRENT_RELEASE%/build-scripts
      * source setup-jdk15.sh
      * make release
   1 Copy the built tar files to the release area: 
      * scp ../target/*_%CURRENT_RELEASE%.tar flxi07.fnal.gov:%RELEASE_TAR_REPOSITORY%/
   1 Update the version number on the [[InstallationGuideVDT][services release TWiki page]]:
      * Edit and update the TWiki variable _<nop>ReleaseVersion_. You willl likely have to use the 'raw edit' mode to change the variable indicating the version number.

<!-- ----------------- DATABASE BACKUP ------------- -->
---+ Database backups and cron/init.d services
The upgrade should not being until all database backups have been complete.

If it is expected that the upgrade will take a long time, then
   1 on the tomcat/collector nodes (gratia08/gratia09)
      * the static report crons should be commented
      * disable the _init.d_ services
   1 on the database node (gratia06)
      * the backup crons  should be commented out.
      * daily reports cron should be commented out
      * the Gratia-APEL interface crons should be commented out 


---++ On the tomcat/collector nodes (gratia08/gratia09)
   1 __comment__ out the __root__ user cron entry for the static reports. Example:
<pre>
42 0 * * * '/data/tomcat-fermi_itb/gratia/staticReports.py' '/data/tomcat-fermi_itb' 'http://gratia-fermi.fnal.gov:8881/gratia-reporting/' 
</pre>
   1 Disable _init.d_ services as __root__ user: 
      * chkconfig tomcat-[GRATIA_INSTANCE] off 

 

---++ On the !MySql server node ( %CURRENT_MYSQL% )
   1 __comment__ out the cron entries for: <p> __gratia__ user cron jobs. 
<pre>
0 0 1-15 * * dir=/home/gratia/interfaces/apel-lcg; cd $dir; ./lcg.sh --config=lcg.conf --date=previous --update 
30 01 * * * dir=/home/gratia/interfaces/apel-lcg; cd $dir; ./lcg.sh --config=lcg.conf --date=current --update 
</pre> 
   1  __root__ user cron entry. 
<pre>
43 2 * * * WILL SUPPLY NAME TUESDAY 
</pre>


<!-- ----------------- UPGRADE AND IMPLEMENTATION ------------- -->
---+ Upgrade and implementation
 The __upgrades should be single-threaded__ , that is, performed for each database schema one at a time.

We will perform these upgrades based on the size of the individual database schema, in ascending order.

---++ On the tomcat/collector nodes
To install the new software on a Gratia tomcat instance, run the following script:
   * /home/weigand/cdcvs/gratia-upgrade.sh

This script will perform the following:
   * Shuts down the tomcat instance
   * runs the update-gratia-local script to update the sofware
   * backs up the tomcat/gratia logs and places in the /data directory as tarballs
   * deletes all logs from the /data/tomcat-[GRATIA_INSTANCE]/logs directory so you have a fresh view when the re-start the service
   * optionally allows you to start the Gratia/tomcat instance.

When you have restarted the service, go to the /data/tomcat-[GRATIA_INSTANCE]/logs directory and tail the logs looking for any bizarre errors.  Definition of bizarre will be supplied later.

Run the static reports cron as _root_ and verify these reports are generated.  At the end of the gratia-update.sh execution, the root cron for the static reports for that instance will be displayed.  Run them as root.  Then in the UI, view the reports to verify they look correct.
