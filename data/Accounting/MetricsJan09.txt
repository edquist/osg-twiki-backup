   * Phillipe, Chris, Ruth, Rob, Chander, John
---++ Notes

Rob: It might be usefull to have some set of example application
than can be used to check what can or can not be done.

All: We all agree that before we can do a survey we need to have
gathered the other technical metrics so we can constract them with
the survey the result.

Ruth: When talking about number of jobs running we also must talk
about the amount of data being transferred.

Philippe: Eventually we need to account for the usage of all OSG
service (including Portal and Globus).

Ruth: Can we have metric on the number of Cores available to the OSG.

Rob: Maybe it is the same as the number of job slot visible to the
OSG (or how many concurrent job can the best match VO run as the same
time on the site assuming nothing else is running).

Ruth: I thinking Monalisa is measuring exactly that.
