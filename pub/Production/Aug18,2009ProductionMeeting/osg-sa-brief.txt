OSG SA workshop, Aug 6,7 2009 - brief report

Based on experience and feedback from previous events, the August 6 and 7 OSG Site Administrators workshop has been planned as "hands-on", reducing the talks to a single morning plenary to introduce OSG to the new Tier 3 administrators, to describe what's new in 1.2 and to present the parallel sessions.

Faculty had been provided in advance with templates for TWiki pages and presentations and a series of meetings coordinated and steered the delivery of programs and material.  
As a result, requirements for each session were available in advance and communicated to site administrators. Several site administrators, 45 registered, took advantage of the expertise that was available, both from the instructors and from other admins. 
The "install-fest" sessions were successful in accelerating the deployment of OSG 1.2, released one week before and important specially for the LHC experiments. Only 1 production resource had 1.2 before the meeting; several services have been installed during the meeting (at least 6 GUMS servers, 6 Computing Elements and 5 Storage Elements); one day after the workshop 8 OSG 1.2 production sites were "green" in MyOSG.

The material produced, covering installations, security, network troubleshooting, virtual machines and monitoring, is available for those who were unable to attend. 
This includes: a series of [[https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/ReleaseDocumentation/SiteAdminsWorkshopTutorialsAug09][practical guides]] on the TWiki and the presentations and some recording of the sessions, both available in  [[http://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=2497][Indico]].
