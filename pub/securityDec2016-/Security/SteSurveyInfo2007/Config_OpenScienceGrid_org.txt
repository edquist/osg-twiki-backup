Dear Mine

opensciencegrid.org is hosted by Tilted Planet and supported through a purchase order placed by the Computing Division.
http://tilted.com/support-change-notice.html

The computing division has a Security Plan agreement with them which is in both OSG and CD docdb.
https://osg-docdb.opensciencegrid.org:440/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=512

Given that we already have an agreement with an "external vendor" for this support.. what is our statement about a needed configuration reference document?  Such would change our agreement with the vendor.

thanks

Ruth

It should list which variables, which web servers, etc are used to build our current web site.
