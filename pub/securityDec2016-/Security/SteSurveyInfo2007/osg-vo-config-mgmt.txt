Hi Doug,

We (the OSG VO) do not yet have anything formal written down on this subject as yet
 but I can tell you that the OSG VOMS and VOMRS servers are run by Fermilab by 
agreement with the OSG. I do not believe that the OSG "owns" even the server instance
 in the way that I think you mean. I have cc'd Chander and Ruth for further comment 
on this. All technical questions regarding configuration and configuration management
 should be directed to the FNAL support center and the answers will be the same (I 
believe) for all VOs run by fermilab, with the distinction that this VOMS instance 
appears in the opensciencegrid.org domain rather than the fnal.gov domain.


I have cc'd this to Keith Chadwick, the Fermigrid Group Leader, who can comment if he
 thinks appropriate (although I think he's at HEPiX this week).

Thanks,
Chris.
