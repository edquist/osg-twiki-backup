Hi Doug,

Here is what I know, most of this is not in our control as the IT
department's Cyber Security division handles these:

> > 1. What type of network scanning is being done?

First of all, all network attached devices must be registered and
assigned an owner, otherwise network access is disabled.  BNL's IT
department primarily uses Nessus to scan all network devices.  They have
also started using SpiDynamics' WebInspect tool to scan web servers.
BNL's IT department also uses tools like the Mazu Profiler to detect
dangerous anomalies in the network and alert and possibly shutdown
servers running unauthorized network services.  Central syslog
collection and analysis is also done to identify potential problems.
Finally, although not part of network scanning, all UNiX type systems
are required to install a local data collection tool called ordo, that
is supposed to collect various types of system config data to ensure
compliance with various DOE and local site policies.

I believe "lite" scans are done daily and more complete scans and audits
are done quarterly.

All detected vulnerabilities must be taken care of in some way, either
by correcting the problem with a possible software upgrade or a
configuration change, then the system must be rescanned to confirm the
vulnerability is no longer present, or by providing a suitable
justification as to why the vulnerability cannot be corrected (i.e.
false positive, acceptable risk, operational need or not correctable).
There is some grace period given to correct or justify the
vulnerability, after which the device is disconnected from the network.

Is this sufficient?
