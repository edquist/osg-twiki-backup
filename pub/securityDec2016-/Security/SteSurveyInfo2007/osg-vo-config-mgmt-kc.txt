Doug,

We (Fermilab) are in the process of establishing a formal MOU between
us and Rob Quick (OSG Operations Coordinator).  Eileen Berman is coordinating
this work from the FermiGrid end.

As Chris Green mentioned, the "osg" VO is "just" another VO which is served
from the FermiGrid "fermigrid2" VOMS server.  We do use some Apache/Tomcat
configuration options to make it appear at voms.opensciencegrid.org.

FermiGrid just "provides" the voms.opensciencegrid.org instance.  Day to day
administration of the "osg" VO is the responsibility of the VO administrators
(Chris Green and Chander Sehgal).  The FermiGrid administrators do not
participate in the day to day operations of the "osg" VO (although we are
available on to fill in for Chris or Chander if an emergency arrises).

-Keith.

I have cc'd Chander and Ruth for further comment on this. All technical 
questions regarding configuration and configuration management should 
be directed to the FNAL support center and the answers will be the same 
(I believe) for all VOs run by fermilab, with the distinction that this 
VOMS instance appears in the opensciencegrid.org domain rather than the 
fnal.gov domain.
