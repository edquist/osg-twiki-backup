These are both run from our web server, so the answer is the same for both.

We are not doing any organized network scanning.

Our support staff is quick to remediate vulnerabilities when they are known.

The Grid Exerciser runs at the same site as the VDT, so the same answer applies: no network scanning, a talented staff fixes vulnerabilities.
