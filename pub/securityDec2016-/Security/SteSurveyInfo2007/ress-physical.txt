Hi Doug,

The central ReSS machines are located in the Computing Room of the Feynman Computing Center at Fermilab. Access is restricted in accordance to Fermilab's access policies to restricted areas. In short, only people with a valid and authorized Fermilab badge can gain access to them.

Access is controlled via the Fermilab Kerberos infrastructure. Machines are maintained by FermiGrid administrators and are accessible by the ReSS developers.

Currently, the ReSS central services are managed on a single server with an 8x5 support plan.

The ReSS services are stateless, so periodic data backups are not necessary. Logs can be periodically backed up, if deemed necessary for security or bookkeeping reasons.

As of Nov 07, the central ReSS services allow anonymous read and write access to the information system. In other words, sites can immediately advertise their information without a need for a previous registration; any user has complete access to all information.

This strategy was used to lower the threshold to be part of the Resource Selection Service. We envision to restrict write access to the service to registered sites only within the next year.
