Any system or service (OSG or not) which is deployed at Fermilab,
participates in the periodic scanning by the Fermilab Computer Security
Team which uses the Nessus toolkit (with all plugins enabled).

These Nessus scans run continuously, and typical system(s) are security
scanned at least once per day.

When an issue is identified, there are several potential remediation
procedures which may be applied (depending on the severity of the
issue).  These remediation procedures range from email notification
of the issue to the registered system administrator, up to and including
blocking the offending system from the network at the nearest switch
port.

Further details regarding the computer security scanning at Fermilab
should be available at:
