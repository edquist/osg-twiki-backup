I have not seen the email. Answers to questions are below.

The hardware we are running was not purchased with OSG money. The 
software part is a Xen virtual machine, so I guess the virtual 
machine could be considered to belong to OSG.

For security reasons, the virtual machine is dedicated to VOMS, 
and has been locked down with a restrictive firewall.

The OSG stack is a standard VOMS install with the only change 
being that we have added the Engage VO.

The changes to the machine has so far been minimal and no 
formal procedures have been established. When upgrades/changes 
are needed, standard system administration cautioness is used.
