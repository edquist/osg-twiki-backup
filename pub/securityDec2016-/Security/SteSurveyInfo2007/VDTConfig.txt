Apache 2.2.
Mason 1.2

For Apache, yes.
For Mason, I have no idea.

We don't use Pacman to run the VDT services. It is software we distribute, just like Globus and Condor.

Pacman is in Python, so we don't need to build it.

Our setup doesn't rely on AFS in the sense that you could replicate our web site without using AFS. I have no idea what version of AFS it is.

Postgres 8.2.5. We let our system administrators maintain it.

Teal is maintained by the system administrators of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences Department. Teal, and our Apache server, is shared with the the Condor team, but the Condor team does not have write access to our files.

This database is maintained and regularly backed up by the system administrators of the University of Wisconsin-Madison Computer Sciences Department. The supporting files of the ticket system (code, HTML, etc) are stored on AFS and are backed up regularly.
