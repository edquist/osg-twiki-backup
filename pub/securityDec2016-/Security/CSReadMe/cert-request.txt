       --label <request label> optional label for request used to identify local

                      over values in the file.  Argument flags that don't take
                      a value must be specified on the command line.

  Side effects:
      Generates some temporary files that are removed automatically
      under normal circumstances.
      Also generates files for the key pair, CSR, and a file called
      currentCertReq.  These files need to be left alone until the
      request/approval/retrieval process if complete as they are used
      by the cert-retrieve script to download the public certificate
      once it has been issued.  Therefore one should use a separate working
      directory for each request if there are multiple requests in process
      simultaneously.
