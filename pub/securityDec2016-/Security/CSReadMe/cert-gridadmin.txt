usage is :  ../bin/cert-gridadmin  <arguments>
    version V2-7
       --host <FQDN>              required
       --service <service name>   optional
       --email <your email, as the owner of the requested certificate>
       --affiliation <user's affiliation>
          (name of your RA to process this request)
       --vo <virtual organization>
          (name of primary virtual organization, only for the OSG RA)
       --list  display list of available RA affiliations and exit
       --prefix <prefix>  prefix for <prefix>{cert|key}.pem file names
            typically used to match service/host to file names
       --password <optional file containing passphrase for private key>
       --request  <optional certificate request>
       --pdir  <optional directory to find user credential for authentication>
                    defaults to ~/.globus
       --sdir  <optional directory to put services credential being generated>
                   defaults to .
       --ca <optional name of CA> to use, default is doegrids,
                 or test2 for worthless certs for testing
       --show  list several parameters of the issued certificate upon successful completion
       --debug spews lots of output to the terminal
       --dryrun  executes script but does not actually post request to CA
       --noclean  do not delete temporary files
       --timeout <seconds> timeout for http transactions
       --help  prints this message
       -V    prints package version and exits
       --read <filename> a file containing parameter values in 'name = value'
                      format for all arguments that take a value except
                      -timeout.  Values on the command line take precedence
                      over values in the file.  Argument flags that don't take
                      a value must be specified on the command line.
       --write <filename> the converse of --read
       any required omitted argruments will be prompted for


  When successful, a certificate (and key) file is generated with
  a name like NNNNNcert.pem (NNNNNkey.pem).  These files should be
  moved to the proper location and the key file protected carefully
  since, as a service certificate key, it is not encrypted or
  password protected.

 Side effects:
      Generates some temporary files that are removed automatically
      under normal circumstances.

  To use the gridadmin interface you must have your personal certificate
  pre-authorized with the CA.  If you are unsure if this was done you
  should check with your Registration Authority.  A list of RAs are shown at
  www.doegrids.org.
  It is recommended that you verify that the certificate subject names you
  are requesting are not already issued to someone else. You can do this
  with the cert-lookup script, or via a search for certificates at the
  www.doegrids.org web site.
