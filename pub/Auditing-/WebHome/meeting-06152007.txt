Summary:

Auditing project overview  presentation 
Discussion of the current status of CEDS troubleshooting project and it relevance to Auditing Project 
The current installation of Troubleshooting software is collecting the logs from gridftp and gatekeeper 
Logs are normalized and are stored as text messages in mysql 
The software that is used for normalization is written in Python. Documentation and packaged software will be available soon, so it could be used for auditing project. 
The scalability of mysql for storage and querying  has not been extensively tested for OSG volume of logged data 
Troubleshooting team will not be working on any additional AAA package, at least for now. Currently the login/password authorization is used to access data 
There is no archiving procedure that could be used by Auditing Project 
 

Discussion of the upcoming vdt release and syslog-ng configuration on CE 
Vdt team willl distribute syslog-ng client and configuration for all CE in vdt 1.7.1. 
The enabling syslog-ng will be optional, but strongly encouraged 
The central collection node will be the node provided by GOC 
In future the hierarchical structure of logs collection will be in place. The logs will be first collected on a site’s mode and then forwarded to a central node, presumably with more filtering. 
 

Discussion of how to proceed with further development of Auditing Project 
Need to identify the group of people who are interested in outcome of this project and are willing to participate in discussion. 
Create a mailing list (Ruth has suggested to use tg-security mailing list) 
Use OSG Auditing Project wiki page for  this project 
Have a  monthly meeting  to report on the progress 
Start working  on “prove of concept” prototype, so people be able to provide feed back
