        SN certificate serial number
        URL the download url for the certificate sometimes sent in an
            email notificate that the certificate is approved
        RID is the request ID of the Request (not certificate) to download.
              NOTE - this uses the agent interface and needs to be
              authenticated with an agent certificate, which means
              it does notwork for most people
        DIR directory for the usercert and key, defaults to ~/.globus
        KEY name of keyfile for private key corresponding to this cert
        PREFIX  causes the key and cert files to be named PREFIXcert.pem
                and PREFIXkey.pem rather than usercert.pem and userkey.pem.
        LABEL  a label used to match the certificate request
             files (incl. private key) with the retrieved certificate.
        R_PARAMS name of file from which to read parameters
        S_PARAMS name of file into which the parameters and options are saved
        CA is the optional name of the CA to use, default is doegrids,
                 other allowed values are for testing
        PKCS12file is the filename to use for exporting your certificate
                   into a PKCS12 format file that can be used to import
                   your certificate into your web browser or email application.
                   This is useful for personal certificates but not very
                   useful for host or service certificates.
                   This file is not affected by the -dir argument.
       --force causes existing credential files to be overwritten with asking
       --debug prints what it is doing
       --help  prints this message
       -V  prints package version and exits
       any omitted argruments will be prompted for.

  Note that options -ca, -dir and -label, if used, must match the values
  used with cert-request. Also it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that -dir and
  -label are specified for host and service certificates, because the
  defaults will overwrite your personal certificate in ~/.globus.

  Side effects:
    Generates some temporary files that get removed in normal operation.
    Relies on files produced by cert-request in order to retrieve the
    corresponding certificate.
