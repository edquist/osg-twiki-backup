
	Meeting Notes on OSG Network Documentation - Sep 11, 2012
	=========================================================

Using ReadyTalk

Attending:  Shawn, Mark Tinberg/Wisc, Kyle Gross/OSG, Jason Zurawski/Internet2, Dale/Wisc, Brian Tierney/ESnet, 
Perry/Wisc, Rob Quick/OSG

Started around 2:03 PM Eastern.

Shawn provide a recap of meeting goals.

Review the agenda:  No additional input.

Cover use-cases for documentation and discuss:


1) General user has (or thinks he has) network problems.   How to "bootstrap" him on the right path? NOTE: user may or 
may not be part of a VO

Must assume a scientist-user without any specific computing or networking knowledge.  

Do we want to give any detailed instructions on running diagnostic apps?
Punt to local staff first?      

Rob: where do the tools get installed (which packages include them)?  (OSGClient is the "rpm set" that has them)

If the "user" is a generic scientist can assume very little experience with networks.  User should provide source, 
destination, error messages and/or unexpected behavior, then use OSG ticketing system.   

Jason pointed out there is no info on what the "results" mean.   Make sure we point to "common" sources for 
application description (general principle to follow).  Use existing ESnet or perfSONAR or Internet2 pages.   

2) OSG site admin has users complaining about problems which may be related to the network.  What is  the check-list 
to go through?

Site admin has Install info, tool descriptions and some guidance.  Rob raised the issue about operations/support-

staff.  Added new item 5) below.

3) VO manager wants to know more about the networking between the various VO/OSG sites.  How can we point him to the 
right info and possibilities?

This is primarily dashboard documentation but overall information about the tools needs to be put into place 
(context).

4) User/VO-manager/OSG site-admin wants to better instrument their site for finding and debugging network problems 
(this is the "install perfSONAR-PS" document).  What are the steps we recommend to follow?  (The "HowTo" for the 
needed perfSONAR-PS installs)

Potentially useful but a different flavor than the other pages.

5) Need separate pages for GOC/Support personnel to detail process and help isolate locations.   This will include 

Jason's training.   Jason can take first pass here.    

6) Need a "front" page which directs the person with the problem to the right "detail" page above.

Alain had also pointed  out that the existing documentation at 
https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/Documentation/Release3/NetworkPerformanceToolkit could potentially use updating and 
relocation.
"I would recommend that we elevate this documentation: instead of being under "Software Guides: Other", it should be 
under "Software Guides: Troubleshooting"."

The existing documentation needs minor updating and refocusing specific to what is required to understand what is 
available, how to install it and verify it.  May include a link to the new pages we need for OSG near the end.

Kyle will create a WebHome for Networking.   

Shawn will take a first pass at the "front" page and items 1-4) and 6) above.  Jason will take a pass at 5) above.

All editors will need X509 certs to access the OSG pages with the ability to edit.  Have to get everyone certs: Rob 
will send aroud the URL.  Those without certs need to get them into their "working" browser.  Let Shawn know if you 
have problems or questions.  Details from Rob here:

-----------------------------------------
For those of you that don't currently have certificates here is the process…

Here is the link to make a DOEGrids Certificate Request: https://software.grid.iu.edu/cert/certreg.php

Your Virtual Organization will be MIS
The Sponsor is Rob Quick
Please add "OSG Networking Group" to the Additional Notes so I recognize these requests. 

You will want to use the "Import Root CAs" button to stop various verification warnings.

After you've obtained your certificate visit oim.opensciencegrid.org and you will prompted to register. After this 

Kyle or I will add you to the Twiki editing list.
 
Let us know if you have questions.
-----------------------------------------

Look for future emails about draft versions for editing.  We will plan our next meeting once we have a complete set of 
draft pages and initial edits and comments to discuss.

Send along any edits/updates to these notes to the list.    Ended around 2:50 PM

Thanks,

Shawn
