> Dear Colleagues,
>
> As in my last communication to this list (dated March 12), you are  
> receiving this e-mail as one of 62 SciDAC researchers representing  
> the currently active 49 SciDAC projects who attended the PI meeting  
> in Atlanta in February.  If you are not the lead PI of your  
> project, please forward this communication to him or her, in  
> addition to considering it, yourself. There is no restriction on  
> its distribution within your project.
>
> You are all invited by Michael Strayer and the SciDAC 2007  
> Organizing Committee to the 2007 conference, June 24-28, which is  
> described at www.scidac.org/Conference2007), subject to capacity  
> constraints. The conference, itself, has a capacity of  
> approximately 300 participants, based on the ballroom of the Westin  
> Copley Place.  200 rooms are being reserved for us at the  
> conference hotel.  The conference has no parallel sessions.  All 40  
> talks and approximately 60 posters are presented by invitation  
> only.  I am pleased to announce that the keynote address will be  
> delivered by Tony Chan, the new head of the Mathematics and  
> Physical Sciences Directorate at the National Science Foundation, a  
> computational mathematician and an early parallel computing  
> pioneer.  Another major address will be given by Toichi Sakata, an  
> Executive Director of RIKEN in Japan.
>
> You are also invited, along with members of your project who may  
> not fit at the principal conference, or who may prefer to skip the  
> "celebration" and show up just for the "working sessions", to the  
> full day of software tutorials hosted at MIT on Friday, June 29.   
> There will be ten tutorials, five run in parallel in the morning  
> and five more in the afternoon, mostly from the SciDAC enabling  
> technology centers and institutes (meshers, solvers, visualizers,  
> etc.), but also one general purpose application framework for  
> plasma simulation.  Each tutorial has a capacity of approximately  
> 40 participants, so approximately 200 additional participants can  
> be accommodated in this way.
>
> The conference and the tutorials are free of registration costs.   
> (A nominal refreshment cost may be levied at the tutorials, pending  
> the result of sponsorship requests.)
>
> ** All SciDAC projects are invited to present at least one research  
> or project overview poster.  While the organizing committee has  
> done an excellent job in surveying the SciDAC field and beyond for  
> talks and posters, some of the newer projects may not have yet been  
> contacted. This e-mail is an invitation to those who have not yet  
> otherwise been contacted. Please reply to me, personally, at  
> david.keyes@columbia.edu, if your project has not yet been signed  
> up for a poster or a talk and confirmed with an e-mail from Betsy  
> Riley (bar@ornl.gov).  I do not trust my canvas of the  
> www.scidac.gov webpages for the most recent updates on SciDAC, and  
> I know that at least a few projects remain to be included.  
> Associated with each poster is a 5-page article in the IOP  
> proceedings of SciDAC 2007, which is a refereed publication venue.  
> Before we publish the first draft of the program on the web, we  
> want to be sure that all projects are entered. **
>
> ** All SciDAC projects are also invited to present a practical  
> tutorial on their software. This applies less uniformly across the  
> projects, as to relevance.  This is the last call for tutorial  
> proposals before we make the initial publicity and open  
> registration. (We do not really need more tutorials, but we do not  
> want to leave anyone out.) **
>
> ** Another possible project-initiated contribution to the SciDAC  
> 2007 program is a "Birds-of-a-feather" lunch table theme. **
>
> We aspire to making this conference as wonderful an opportunity to  
> discover the latest DOE-supported software tools and the  
> penetration of large-scale simulation into real applications as  
> were the San Francisco and Denver meetings.
>
> Your comments and suggestions for how to make the SciDAC 2007  
> program a success for your scientific subcommunity and a good  
> return on your invested time are welcome.
>
> Thanks very much,
>
> David
