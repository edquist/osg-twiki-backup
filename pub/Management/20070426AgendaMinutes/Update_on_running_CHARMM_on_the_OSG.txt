Subject: Update on running CHARMM on the OSG

Hi Ruth, Frank, Torre, and Petar,

Ana and I thought that this would be a good opportunity to update everyone on the status of our project. Currently, we are running three workflows as part of our larger research project.

Our major concerns at this point are site failures and job slots. Various intermittent problems have caused us to see a failure rate of 30%-50% in jobs we submit. We've submitted several trouble tickets and will continue to do so for future problems. Furthermore, it seems that sometimes there is a shortage of slots and some of our submissions have to wait 1-2 days to start. We're going to try to add more sites to our lineup and perhaps try to get some previously failing sites to work.

We are currently working on the following:

1. Getting TestPilot to run some further tests to cut down on the number of job failures.
2. Doing additional testing on sites before submitting production jobs to them.
3. Looking for new sites we can run on.
4. Tweaking our own scripts/setup to be as efficient as possible.

Best Wishes,
Tim
