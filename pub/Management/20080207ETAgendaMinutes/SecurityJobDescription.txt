OSG Policy work requires an individual with extensive security knowledge and broad understanding of distributed computing (grids in particular). The job responsibilities include defining and writing security policies that governs the operational security needs of Virtual Organizations, Sites, software providers and the OSG. The policies aim to define the relationships between and responsibilities of VOs, Sites, software providers and OSG toward one another. Thus, policies cover a wide span from service agreements to agreed usage policies, from auditing to incident response. Since the policies must be written and approved jointly by several parties (external to OSG), the person at this position must analyze security implications from multiple different angles and be prepared to discuss it with external parties.This job can be done by a 0.5 FTE, and may require travel 15-30% of 0.5 FTE, including international meetings once a quarter. Some of the meetings can be attended remotely in order to reduce travel times. A computer scientist with a strong information security background and some experience in security policies (not specific to OSG policies, but being familiar with policy work in general, such as NIST guidelines, HIPPA policies, etc) would be an ideal candidate. It is expected that this person may require an initial learning curve to understand the specifics of OSG work. This person most also be willing to understand the grid sociology and must be at the least familiar with grid technologies. Strong writing and communication skills are absolutely needed. This person must flexibly negotiate and come to agreements with other parties when necessary. Therefore, human skills are a must for this job. Prior experience with well-known security guidelines/policies is a big plus
