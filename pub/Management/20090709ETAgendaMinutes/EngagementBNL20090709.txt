Summary of Engagement Activity with Nonproliferation Department at BNL

(Maxim Potekhin)

We have engaged a research group in Nonproliferation Department at BNL
for potential participation as a VO in OSG. We are using this engagement
as a vehicle to test a concept of a web portal for end user data and job
submission to facilities managed by OSG. A simple but functional
prototype of a web service was created to meet this goal. Documentation
can be found at:

https://www.usatlas.bnl.gov/twiki/bin/view/AtlasSoftware/DataHost

The user successfully processed a batch their experimental data collected
in the material science lab, using this web service and computing facilities at
NERSC. Currently, we are looking into obtaining a separate IDL license
(since this is the platform they use to process data) and an IDL VM so
we can dispatch the jobs to sites other than Jacquard and Franklin clusters
at NERSC (which are not well suited for scalar computation).
