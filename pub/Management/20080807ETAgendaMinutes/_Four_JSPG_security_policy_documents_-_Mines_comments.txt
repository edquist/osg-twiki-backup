I will attend the meeting if you like and be ready to talk more about
these.

Yes this policy complies with OSG's existing policies and procedures. I
have no objection against its approval. Most of the items here are
already being implemented by OSG e.g. #1 VO contacts and cooperating
during incidents. It also mentions a VO not violating its own AUP and
User management Policies. WLCG will require Atlas and CMS to have these
policies anyway. so we can discuss it later.
I would say this policy is almost implemented and maybe another 6 months
and it would be fully done.

the biggest hold back here is that sites have to have central logging
services and must keep their logs for minimum 90 days. This was not in
my original roadmap. It is very desirable and i ideally would love to do
it. but then we must think about providing syslog-ng and equivalent to
sites

we will completely change this policy. We will ask VOs to pick and
choose which CAs are needed for their operations. We will provide more
monitoring on those CAs. The design phase of this project is due to
first querter 09. Currently, we have an OSG policy that fully complies
with WLCG

it requires the pilot job framework to have glexec or its equivalent in
place. This is a technical problem for sites who did not deploy glexec
yet allows opportunistic use of WLCG VOs. Also it asks for a logging
mechanism at the framework and at the VO job queue, protecting each
users jobs from one another.
So there is possibly technical development to be done.
