Hi Ruth,

    A couple of comments.    I think most of these issues are a negotiation between OSG and EGEE, which can be delegated to Mine and the OSG on behalf of CMS.   The basic requirement from CMS is that we can reasonably transparently access both grids, so both EGEE and OSG need to trust each other enough that we don't have a refusal to accept glide-in jobs to EGEE sites or RB jobs on OSG sites.

Specific issues:
1.) The Virtual Organization Operations Policy will conceivably be agreed to by CMS to allow them to run on EGEE sites.   The lack of an equivalent document for OSG should not prevent CMS from running on either EGEE or OSG sites currently since the document seems designed to protect the grid infrastructure provider.    When the time comes CMS would like input into the OSG document if it differs substantively from the EGEE document.

2.) The lack of Grid Security, Traceability and Logging seems the most problematic.   OSG will need an exemption.  This is one of those cases I could see transparent access being broken because EGEE decides they can't reasonably submit jobs to OSG without traceability.   This seems like one OSG needs to work on.

3 and 4 appear to be under control.

As I understand it OSG makes its concerns known at the Grid Deployment Board but, the GDB is also a recommendation not a decision making body.
