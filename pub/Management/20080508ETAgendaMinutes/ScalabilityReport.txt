Hi Ruth and Chander,

here's Toni's progress report for the scalability work:

Recall, the goal of the activity is:

-> Develop procedures to:
     => measure the performance limits of the OSG CE.
     => understand the performance limit in terms of underlying hardware and software artefacts.
     => understand the negative inpact on useability when the limits are exceeded.
-> Execute the procedures on example OSG CE at UCSD, and document the results.

What we have now is an initial rpm that monitors every 5 minutes specific processes for the grid (globus-job-mana, condor_schedd, condor_starter, condor_shadow...) in terms of memory, cpu, open files... so that we can know when, and why the CE fails, if it does it. Previously we had only generic information about the computer, that we still have. Now, we can pin point in an easier way who is the guilty.

   We tried to send batches before having this information of  1000 and 10000 jobs at a time and the CE was behaving with some peculiarities. We are repeating the tests now that the CE is better instrumented.

  We are working towards having the monitoring information logged to both a logfile as well as a DB. Initial sets of DB tables have been defined,
and are being implemented in the monitoring DB for the OSG site at UCSD. From this DB information, we will derive plots in the future to have
time histories of different quantities, and thus visually correlate events when performance limits are exceeded.

 We want to point out that this is somewhat of an R&D project. I.e., we won't know for sure what quantities need to be monitored until we're done.
It's thus not easily possible to assign "% completion" to this activity.

At this point, Toni, Sanjay, and Terrence are all contributing to this activity, with Toni being the lead.

Thanks, Frank
