Subject: "Slide" for OSG council meeting for D0

 Dear Council,

  Since I will not be able to attend the Council meeting in person
 and will need to phone in.  I have written down the issues for
 D0 



 Science from Grid

 We have had 1 analysis project performed on OSG at D0.  This
 was a matrix element analysis for measuring the top mass.
 The analyzer (Michael Wang) would have needed our entire cluster
 for over a month to finish his project so this was not practical.
 Michael was able to get 300,000 CPU hours and was able to finish
 the project.  The analysis was very simple.  He sent ASCII files,
 did some calculations and then returned an ASCII file.  Michael
 was quoted as "Running analysis jobs required a significant amount
 of effort and attention"

 D0 is continuing to do its reprocessing on OSG.  We currently need
 to process 500 million events and would like to be done by the end
 of April.  In order to accomplish this, we need to process over
 8 million events/day.  We are able to process ~ 3 million events/day
 using both OSG and dedicated farms at IN2p3 and Westgrid.

To see the progress of our reprocessing you can see plots at:

http://www-d0.fnal.gov/computing/reprocessing/p20/stats/Stats.html

see links:
Cumulative progress, remote sites only
Daily totals, remote sites only

You will notice that the dedicated site (In2p3) is processing the
same as all OSG sites combined,


You can see the efficiencies of the various sites at

OSG sites Performance Plots 

(Note the much higher efficiency at In2p3)

One can see that many of our OSG jobs are not completing successfully.

So the main items keeping us from running better are:

o poor efficiency 
o not having a resource selector
o Difficult to determine problems using monitoring tools


Plans for next 9 months:

Once the reprocessing is finished,
Our future goals is to increase the amount of MC produced using OSG.
Right now only 0.6% of our MC is produced on OSG.  (2.0% on LCG)
