Subject: RE: CDF and the OSG (fwd)

Hi Rick,

On Monday, we had our IFC meeting in which we went over our success of the
last year and talked about what it takes for CDF to complete its final set
of analyses, both in terms of  human resources and computing capability.
CDF has been, and continues to be a remarkably successful experiment.  We he
have published over 300 papers in run II and since 2005 have averaged over
40 publications/year and on two occasisons close to 60.  Our success and our
ability to get our physics out is completely tied to computing.  If we can't
process our data and produce sufficient MC simulations -- we will fail.  OSG
has been and continues to be critical to the success of the CDF experiment
and to the Tevatron program in general.  CDF produces >90% of its MC
simulations at remote sites -- leaving the Fermilab computing facilities
available for data processing, event reconstruction and data analysis.  This
model has worked very well.  We have been able to generate literally
billions of events over the years using remote resources and the GRID.  OSG
is our interface to these facilities and its  use is critical to our
success.  Without OSG, CDF would  not be even close to the succees that it
has been.

I have discussed these points with our US Funding Rep's -- namely Saul
Gonzalez (DOE), Glenn Crawford(DOE), Moishe Pripstein (NSF), and Joe Dehmer
(NSF).  Their continued support of OSG is paramount. [...] Jim Seigrist is the
new head of DOE.  I did get a little time to talk to him last week but not
in regards to this topic.  I plan on having this discussion with him in late
October and the fall HEPAP meeting in DC.

Thanks

Rob
