Resource sharing and aggregation

A fundamental concern facing campus cyberinfrastructures, regardless of "grid-ness" is answering the question about how to share and aggregate resources on the campus.

Among successful campus grids, several different strategies exist for aggregating resources into a grid.

GLOW 
GLOW, at the University of Wisconsin, aggregates physically distributed "clusters" of systems into a single Condor pool, with physical management of the systems performed at the department level, and software managed centrally. A site can join GLOW with a minimum contribution of one rack of machines.

GLOW provides AFS storage shared among its sites.



Purdue
Purdue aggregates resources both via its "community cluster" program, where faculty research dollars are pooled together to build a single large cluster, with professional system administration, support, and facilities; and the use of Condor to tie together otherwise idle machines in student labs and around the campus, with idle cluster nodes. A group can join the community clusters with a single node.

Distributed Condor resources at Purdue are managed with the "CycleServer" management console - useful for maintaining Condor configuration on machines with distributed ownership.

Purdue provides pre-configured packages to aid departments with adding resources to the campus grid.

Purdue clusters share centralized NFS servers.


FermiGrid
At FermiGrid, distinct, previously independent clusters are aggregated together with middleware - placing all clusters behind a single point of entry. All FermiGrid clusters share site-level services (GUMS, SAZ, MyProxy, VOMS, etc)

FermiGrid clusters share centralized NFS servers.
