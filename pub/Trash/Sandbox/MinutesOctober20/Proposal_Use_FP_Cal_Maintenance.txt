Hi. Some of you may remember that we used to create tickets for maintenance to OSG Resources. For good reason, we stopped doing that when we developed the original OSG maintenance tool. But as we move forward with the development of our tools, I wonder if we might want to revisit whether creating tickets for maintenances might be a good idea.

Before you get too excited, let me state that there would be some stipulations, one being that we would want the tickets to auto-generated based on data given to us from OIM. But for now, let's assume we can do this. What are the benefits?

1. The calendar functionality is already provided by Footprints, and supported by GRNOC.
2. Support for iCal.
3. Support for RSS.
4. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance calendars provided.
5. As you can, a lot of work is already done for us.

Our calendar isn't working at the moment, but you can view other GRNOC project calendars at:

I bring this up because we don't have an RSS or iCal feature with our current tool, and with little effort, I believe we could utilize the FP calendar feature (which should also be supported in future releases) to achieve those things. One drawback could be that we might not be able to hack it to fit our exact wants and needs. And I am not certain if we can populate the necessary fields via email, but I suspect if Soichi gets the database hooks thing figured out, this won't be an issue. So think about it, discuss it, and we can talk about this at Monday's team meeting.
