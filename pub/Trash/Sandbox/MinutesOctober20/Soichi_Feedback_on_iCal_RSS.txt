I am completely in favor of publishing downtime info in RSS/iCAL, etc. For iCal, I currently have following iCal export for OSG dashboard.

http://rsv.grid.iu.edu/trunk/downtime/ical

I haven't tested it other than Thunderbird on my laptop, but It's been (seemingly) working fine. It is just pulling downtime records from OIM and formatting it in .ics format. We can add / change format for each fields as we see fit.. It's very easy to publish it through iCal, and I am guessing RSS feed is pretty easy as well. I am using "all-day" event mode for this feed.

Other items that I'd like to discuss...

1. How do I go about integrating various things in OSG onto dashboard.

   Easiest way to do this is to show pages in iframe inside OSG
  dshboard, but this makes it harder to widget-ize the content (we
  don't want header / footer stuff in our widget, and also make it
  harder to set different style sheet in iframe..) Of couse, not
  provinding UWA widget is one options.

  Pulling and parsing certain part of the page maybe doable, but if it
  is hosted through https (only), we somehow take the certificate from
  client and pass it to the source webserver - I am not sure if this
  can be easily accomplished.

2. Footprint Webservice API *wrapper*.

  Right now, the best solution to create / edit / query FP tickets is
  to modify the FP Webservice API so that it will let us access it
  without having admin account. (Basically create a security hole, and
  patch with alternative security mechanism - I will explain this in
  the meeting).

  For updating the FP Schema (VO names, etc), we can create a script
  that pulls information from OIM and directly update the schema file
  (schemas are not stored in table, but are stored in a flat file for
  each project).

That's it for now!
