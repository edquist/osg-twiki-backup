Blueprint Notes/Misc

Provisioning

? Exact relationship to virtualization, cloud 

ATLAS activites/ shifts:
 -- event server, intended for HPC
   -- but, already having trouble with non-portable domain software 
 -- atlas has moved cloud-oriented provisioning to Ops from R&D effort. 
    -- Cloudscheduler at UVic in production use.   
 -- no farm purchase planned for 2015
 -- dedicated ATLAS sites all homogeneous now--not much within-site variation in power, network, etc. 
   -- allows moving to site cloud model vs. old situation requiring smart batch systems and close management. 
-- definite plan to migrate physical resources at ATLAS sites to Openstack. 
-- major pilot project w/ AWS. $200k
  --  discuss dinner w/ jamie k. and his program (hires, long-term view, etc). 
-- pilot project to enable Federated ID-based data transfer systems. No more x509/VOMS. 

Key Observation: OSG, and grid computing, has so far been based on the concept of variable resource usage allowing sharing. The shifts above make that basis unsustainable. 
**Once this shift has occurred for ATLAS, what is the OSG role?**
 Role to date: facilitate sharing
 New role: support, workload infrastructure, and resource brokering? 
  

APF at GLOW
-- glidein.py: need assigned condor developer/co-developer

-- glidein.py 
 -- start: configs, directories 
 -- end: collect logfiles, statistics of activity
 -- need to create clear description of glidein wrapper need (John) --> Todd

parameters:
  condor version
  collector
  authtype
  authtoken
  report-collector
  location for tarball/binaries
auto-detect:
  platform 
  architecture  

OSG Services?:

-- pre-built Condor startds on EC2
-- create CE on EC2 temporarily 
  -- report to gratia

Brian: Officially make "adding OSG WN to EC2 programmatically" a Technology Investigation

 
OLD ISSUES
-- osg-xd brian/todd did work , fed back to mats
-- partitionable slots vs. preemption, schedd-managed preemption
   -- back to startd-rank after will sk pointed out we have multiple schedds. 
-- cvmfs formal relationship (brian)
-- fewer real certs, how many fake certs (mine)


Thursday AM
============================================

-- opportunistic usage? can glideins rather than VMs. 
-- ?? VO in GLOW with use for virtualization?
 -- could we potentially use amazon allocation to run GLOW?

-- Dynamic CE

-- ?? what are the security implications of a dynamic resource *moving* from physical facility to facility (Mine)

-- elastic IP usage vs. reverse lookups at physical sites. 
   This could be an OSG service-- providing ce01.osg.org   service in EC2
   -- how many host certificates?
   -- service certs vs. host certs. 
  -- condor worker joining pool same as dynamic CE joing OSG
    -- PE vs. CE (provisioning element vs. compute element)
    
-- question of finer-grained trust between pool nodes and CM. 

=====================
-- github for osg software
  -- security (integrity)
  -- privacy 
  -- data loss
  -- uptime/mission critical?
