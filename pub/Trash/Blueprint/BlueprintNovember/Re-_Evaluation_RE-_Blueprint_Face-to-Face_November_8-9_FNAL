There were bugs in both osg-info-services and CEMon, as well as a few differences in interpretation.  Can we discuss these tomorrow and update your slides as necessary?BrianOn Nov 3, 2010, at 10:07 PM, Parag Mhashilkar wrote:> Hi Ruth,> > I have attached my slides listing my findings from the evaluation.
