---+ The Grid3 Model for Local Storage
%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%
The Grid3 Model is a simple Compute Element with one or few nodes that includes the following storage areas defined:
   * OSG_GRID
   * OSG_APP
   * OSG_DATA
   * OSG_WN_TMP

Although systems administrators can point both OSG_DATA and OSG_WN_TMP to the same directory and use a single, shared disk, we do not recommend them doing so.

   $ %X% *%RED%WARNING%ENDCOLOR%*: The Grid3 Model should not be used for production CEs.
