---++ OSG Registration
%EDITTHIS%

To register the site with the OSG Grid Operations Center and into the Grid Catalog please use the [[https://goc.grid.iu.edu][webform]] (NOTE: You must have a valid certificate loaded into your browser to access the registration page.) located under the OSG [[http://osg.ivdgl.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GridAdminstratorSupport][Administrator Support page]]. If you are registering into the OSG, be sure to check the appropriate box for which grid catalog you are registering with. You should receive an email response automatically back from the GOC to the operations contact you supplied. If this response doesn't arrive within a reasonable delay, please resubmit your registration.

A minimal amount of information is needed for the OSG Grid Operations Center (GOC) to publish a site to the monitoring and operational infrastructure. This includes organization name, organization manager or designated representative name and email, security contact name and email, resource URL, support center, and form submitter. 

While this minimal information will allow the GOC to publish your information to the monitoring tools, more information is requested to make site and support center communication easier. Please take time to fill out the form completely.
