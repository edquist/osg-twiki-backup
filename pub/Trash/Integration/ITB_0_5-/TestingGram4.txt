---++ Task 1

   * ==globusrun-ws -submit -F *<i>hostname</i>*:9443 -c /bin/date==
   * ==globusrun-ws -submit -F *<i>hostname</i>*:9443 -s -c /bin/date==
      * basis validation table entry: %Y% success, %G% failure, %O% connection refused
   * ==globusrun-ws -submit -F *<i>hostname</i>*:9443 -s -job-description-file filename.txt==
   * ==globusrun-ws -submit -F *<i>hostname</i>*:9443 -Ft {Condor|PBS}== with above iterations
      * successful sites - now see https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/WsGramOsgSites

---++ Task 2
   * in preparation

---++ Task 3

   *  installed OSG-Client package
      * ==pacman -get ITB:client== 
      * reinstalled on 02/20
      * fresh install 02/26 to fix pilot-error/soft link problem
   *  repeat of Task 1 tests yielded same results
      * continued in Task 4
 

---++ Task 4

   * Used final OSG-Client installation from Task 3, configured a 'full install host'
   * ==vdt-control --on== to turn on condor 
      * instead of just the <i>master + schedd</i> from my attempt to configure as a 'submit-host', it now includes <i>collector, negotiator, startd </i> 
   * downloaded test scripts from http://t2.unl.edu/cms/ws-osg-tests/  and edited for current tests
      * current tests are now successful
   * wrote my own similar tests via OSG documents with same results
   
---++ Task 5

   * Using full condor install via OSG-Client installation of Task 4, began testing ITB set of sites
   * added https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Integration/WsGramOsgSites listing sites working via ws gram
