---+!! About the OSG_SITE_WRITE Storage Area

%STARTINCLUDE%
%EDITTHIS%

OSG_SITE_WRITE is a write-only (or "mostly write") transient / volatile storage area that is visible from all worker nodes and optimized for high-performance write operations and holds the output from jobs running on the CE that is required to persist beyond the originating job's lifetime. 

OSG_SITE_WRITE allows open, set flags, write (sequential, with multiple write operations), and close, although it may not be possible to modify a file once it is closed. 

OSG_SITE_WRITE is provided through a grid file access library specific for the underlying storage, and programs may use it transparently as a local disk space.

%NOTE% Limitations should be avoided when possible, and be clearly stated.

Users shall not have read access to this area. In cases where read access is necessary, the site administrator must facilitate access, or provide mechanisms external to the CE, such as supporting Storage Element reading that area.<sup>[[#Note1Sec4][4]]</sup> <!-- Its features cover the write part of OSG_DATA and it is recommended to big sites to force users not to use DATA as a 'catch-all' directory affecting the performance of the cluster.-->

---+++ Typical uses of OSG_SITE_WRITE
   * Storage of datasets produced by the jobs executing on the worker nodes
   * Data waiting to be staged out
