The Authorization system determines who can access your resources and how. A good description of the available authorization scenarios can be found on  the
<a href="http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/guide_architecture.html#GUMS_in_the_grid_architecture">
GUMS web site</a>.  Of those discussed, OSG supports three, namely: Grid3/Local, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. All three use VOMS. Here's a brief explanation of each follows.
GUMS web site</a>.  Of those discussed, OSG supports three, namely: Grid3/Local, Compatibility, and Full Privilege. All three use VOMS. Here's a brief explanation of each:

<b>Grid3 or Local !GridMap file</b><br>
Authorization is performed only via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper. The grid-mapfile is either created manually on each gatekeeper, or created by the edg-mkgridmap-upgraded periodically based upon the configureation file edg-mkgridmap.conf file located int $VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc. This file is installed by the VO package which can be updated to add or update VO information. The OSG Operations sends update announcements to each support center.  VOMS is used; GUMS is not used. Synchronizing all the grid-mapfiles for multiple CE nodes needs to be done manually in this case.  You may prefer this configuration if:
      <UL><LI> You are a small site (one gatekeeper) and,
                <LI>You deal with a small set of fairly static VOs
       </UL>

<b>Compatibility</b><br>
Authorization is performed via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper, and the
file is created by GUMS.  GUMS polls VOMS Admin periodically and creates/updates the grid-mapfile. If the site has only one GUMS server (one communication point to VOMS), centralized mapping is enabled. Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).  You should consider this configuration if:
      <UL><LI>Your gatekeeper(s) or service must be configured using a grid-mapfile (i.e. you have tools or services that manipulate this file directly, without passing through globus)
                <LI>You'd rather approach with caution than jump right into running GUMS 24/7.
       </UL>
<b>Full Privilege</b><br>
This scenario implements the PRIMA authorization module with GUMS and does not use the grid-mapfile.  The gatekeeper uses a callout to PRIMA upon receipt of each request, PRIMA forwards the request to the GUMS web service which performs the dynamic mapping. PRIMA can process FQAN (Fully Qualified Attribute Names), thus enabling mapping based on VO groups and roles as defined in VOMS.

Authorization is performed only via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper. The grid-mapfile is either created manually on each gatekeeper, or created by a VOMS Admin installation.  VOMS is used; GUMS is not used. Synchronizing all the grid-mapfiles for multiple CE nodes is difficult in this case.

In this configuration, you will need the EDG mkgridmap daemon running on your gatekeeper to create the grid-mapfile (discussed below).

The <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> script uses a configuration file to dictate 
  its behavior. This config file is 
  <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>.

  The <i>edg-gridmapfile-upgrade</i> daemon has a similar configuration
  file: <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</i>.

  One of the parameters specifies a _local_ <i>grid-mapfile</i> that
  will be added to the output of the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> command (the set of DNs returned from all the VOMS).  You need to populate this file; it's at <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local</i>

Now, to create this local portion:
<OL>
<LI> Set the *GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE* variable in 
    <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</i> as shown. <b>Warning</b>: If you put in a bad address, it won't find the file, but it fails silently.
   <pre>
      GRIDMAP_LOCAL_FILE=$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/grid-mapfile-local
    </pre>
</LI>
<LI>  Add this new directive to the end of the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>  (use the actual path, not the $VDT_LOCATION variable).   If you put in a bad address, you should get an error message.
  <pre>

You should now have local <i>grid-mapfile</i> entries added to this file every time the script is executed.
   * Any <i>gmf_local</i> directive(s) should be the last entries in the <i>edg-mkgridmap.conf</i> file.
---+++ Configure the list of VOs you wish to enable
The default configuration, set in the <i>$VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-mkgridmap.conf</i>  file, provides access from all registered and approved OSG VOs. If that is acceptable to you, then you're done with this step. If not, then you'll need to edit the file commenting out the line for each VO you wish to disable.

Refer to the [[Integration.ITB_0_5.EdgMkgridmapTroubleshootingGuide][edg-mkgridmap troubleshooting guide]] for any problems/errors.
---+++ Configuring /etc/rc.d services for edg-mkgridmap
Since VOs are likely adding/removing members over time, you will want to update your grid-mapfile to reflect this. OSG provides  the /etc/rc scripts for this service.  The following commands will copy and start the daemon (do these as <i>root</i>). 
<pre>
   &gt; cp $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded /etc/init.d/.
   &gt;  /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded start
</pre>
The script will run as a daemon updating the gridmap file based on the <i>GRIDMAP_UPGRADE_DELAY=1d</i> attribute in <i>VDT_LOCATION/edg/etc/edg-gridmapfile-upgrade.conf</i>.

Make sure you run <i>chkconfig --add  /etc/init.d/edg-gridmapfile-upgraded</i> so that the service will automatically start on a reboot.

---+++ Test  the Grid3/Local configuration
---++ Compatibility configuration
Authorization is performed via the grid-mapfile on the gatekeeper, and the
file is created by GUMS.  GUMS polls VOMS Admin periodically and creates/updates the grid-mapfile. If the site has only one GUMS server (one communication point to VOMS), centralized mapping is enabled. Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).

In Compatibliity mode, authorization is still performed using the <i>grid-mapfile</i>.  The difference is in the source of the VO membership data/account assignments.  Instead of each CE node pulling independently from the VO VOMS servers.  Each CE node for your site pulls the data from your site's GUMS server.  Thus, centralized mapping is enabled.  Your site's GUMS server polls the VOs' VOMS servers much the same as the <i>edg-mkgridmap</i> process did, the difference being that all CE nodes account assignments are managed in one place, the GUMS server.  Given the GUMS configuration options, account pools (many accounts, one-to-one DN-to-account mapping) can be implemented as well as group accounts (many-to-one DN-to-account mapping).

<UL>
<LI>You will not be able to provide role based authorization in this configuration. 
<LI>You will introduce delays since each gatekeeper will have to regenerate the map before implementing the new policy or allowing new users.

</UL>
---+++Compatibility Requirements
Your site needs to install and configure GUMS service. There needs to be one GUMS server per map of 'DN to local uid'. An institution would only need one GUMS server if there is a global uid assignment (eg. a single NIS domain).  If you will have multiple account domains, you will need a GUMS server for each domain.   Each account domain can cover  any number of CE hosts, clusters storage elements (SEs)  as long as all systems have a consistent set of POSIX Users|UIDs|Groups|GIDs.

This scenario implements the PRIMA authorization module with GUMS and does not use the grid-mapfile.  The gatekeeper uses a callout to PRIMA. Upon receipt of each request, PRIMA forwards the request to the GUMS web service which performs the dynamic mapping of the user's certrificate to a UNIX account.   PRIMA can process FQAN (Fully Qualified Attribute Names), thus enabling mappings based on VO groups and roles as defined in VOMS.

In this configuration, requests to your gatekeeper(s) and gsiftp service(s) use the authorization callout to contact the  GUMS authorization service  which checks whether the requester is permitted access and, if access is permitted, returns a local user id assigned to the requester's grid credential.

To test the <i>grid3-user-vo-map</i> generation, you need to run as <i>root</i>.  This uses the host certificate.
<pre>
  &gt;  source $VDT_LOCATION/setup.sh
  &gt;  cd $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin
  &gt;  ./gums-host generateGrid3UserVoMap   <b><i>(output goes  to stdout. To get a file: either redirect stdout or use '--file file_name')</i></b>
  <i>...output  should look similar to the following dependent on you GUMS server mappings..
  <i>...output  should look similar to the following dependent on you GUMS server mappings..</i>
  #User-VO map
  # #comment line, format of each regular line line: account VO
  # Next 2 lines with VO names, same order, all lowercase, with case (lines starting with #voi, #VOc)
  #voi xxx test3
  #VOc OSG TEST3
  #---- accounts for vo: osg ----#
  osg01 xxx
  #---- accounts for vo: Test3userGroup ----#

<LI>GUMS 1.1 syntax:  your host is not in the <i>cn</i> attribute of the <i>hostGroup</i> element.
A cron job <i>gums-host-cron</i> has been provided in $VDT_LOCATION/gums/bin/gums-host-cron, as well as a template to insert into
/etc/cron.d in $VDT_LOCATION/post-install/gums-host-cron.
<ul>
<LI>The <i>gums-host-cron</i> requires no modification for Full Privilege mode.  It looks for the existence of the <i>gsi-authz.conf</i> file that activates the PRIMA callout and, if present, will not attempt a refresh of the <i>grid-mapfile</i>.
</ul>
<UL>
<LI>it executes the <i>gums-host</i> command  using both the <i>generateGridMapfile</i> and <i>generateGrid3UserVoMap</i> arguments
<LI>it will creates a temporary copy of the files and compares them against the current copy
<LI>it only updates the CE nodes current copy if a change has occured
</UL>
The default interval is every 6 hours. Example cron:
<pre>
  0 0,6,12,18 * * * root /storage/local/data1/osg/gums/bin/gums-host-cron
</pre>

problem is likely in the GUMS server's gums.config file:
%INCLUDE{"GumsHostCron050"}%
   * GUMS 1.1 syntax: your host is not in the <i>cn</i> attribute of the <i>hostGroup</i> element.
%INCLUDE{"Integration.ITB_0_5.GumsHostCron"}%
