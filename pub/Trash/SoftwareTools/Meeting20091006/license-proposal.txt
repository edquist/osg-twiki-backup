Subject: Proposal for a common license for OSG-developed software

Hello everyone,

This is a proposal for a common OSG software license. This is item
1.1.7.1 from the Software WBS for Year 4. I think we should talk about
it first in the OSG Software Tools Group. When the details have been
ironed out, we can discuss it more widely in OSG.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks!

===== Background =====

I have a shameful confession to make. The code developed as part of
the VDT (our configuration scripts and the like) is not licensed. I've
always intended for it to be under an open-source license, and I treat
it like it's open-source, but it's not licensed. RSV, OIM, and
configure-osg are in the same boat. This is particularly shameful
because I always make sure that software from an external software
provider has a license before we ship it. So I want to fix this
situation.

===== Goal =====

Instead of merely proposing a license for the VDT, I would like to
propose a license for all OSG-developed software. I don't think I can
mandate a license because individual institutions will have strong
opinions on what happens by their employees. However I think that
having a recommended default license will simplify the decision
process for most OSG-developed software and make it easier for people
to understand the licensing of OSG-developed software.

===== Proposal =====

I propose that we license OSG-developed software under the Apache
License, Version 2.0.

You can find the license and sample contributor license agreements at:
http://www.apache.org/licenses/

A FAQ about the license, including a plain English description of some
of the license:
http://www.apache.org/foundation/licence-FAQ.html

For your convenience, I've copied the full license below.

===== Why the Apache License? =====

1) It's an open-source license, and our work should be
open-source. Although I can't find the reference right now, I think
that NSF wants software developed through its funding to be
open-source.

2) I think the main reason to the use the Apache License is that
several of our close collaborators use it, including Condor, Globus,
and gLite.
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
http://www.globus.org/toolkit/legal/4.0/
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/EGEE/EGEEgLiteSoftwareLicense

While it may seem simplistic to say "We'll use it because they use
it", I like the idea of uniformity with our closest
collaborators. Also, I know that lots of smart people in these
projects thought hard about what license to choose.

3) Unlike the similarly free BSD license, the Apache license clarifies
patent claims. Contributors to the source code grant users of the
software use of the patents they own if their code uses those patents.

4) The Apache License has almost no restrictions on the use of the
code. (You need to keep the copyright and note what has been modified
if you redistribute it.) I like the idea that government-sponsored
work is freely available for us by everyone. This is unlike the GPL
which makes it hard for companies to use the software in closed-source
projects. This is a philosophical point on which you might disagree
with me. Probably no amount of arguing will resolve it, but I'm happy
to discuss it if you want to.

===== Questions For You =====

* What do you think of this proposal?

* For multi-institutional work, what should the copyright be? Should
  the copyright list all of the relevant organizations? Does it make
  sense to have copyright owned by Open Science Grid?

* I'm not an expert in law. Do I need to discuss with with a lawyer?
  Who needs to approve this?

* I'm not an expert in licenses--what other questions should I be
  asking? What other issues should I be worrying about?

* Does it make sense to propose a single license for all OSG-developed
  software?

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
