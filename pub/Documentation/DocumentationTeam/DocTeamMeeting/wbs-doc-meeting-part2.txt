Define major page types & develop standards for each (e.g. procedures, training manual)
   Page Types:
     - step-by-step procedural 
     - general information
     - training manual (note: combination of the other types) 
     - troubleshoot & help 

Research what forms of presentation/annotation are available in TWiki
   - look for external solution for annotation (i.e. web service tools that annotate html pages)

   Can we have a tool that can collect documentation into training materials?
   - yes, there is a twiki->latex plugin; it's a good starting point

Implement an effective search/retrieval system
   Solution: use the 'google' search; but in order to do that 2 separate twikis need to be created => longer time required
