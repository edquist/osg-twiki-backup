The VDT web server and file servers are in a locked machine room.

Yes, we use OpenSSH.

I'm not sure I understand the question in the context of the VDT.

The VDT web server is a standard web server. We have no control over who can access the web site: anyone can download from the VDT web site. This could be seen as a potential denial of service attack, but it is no different than any other web server.
