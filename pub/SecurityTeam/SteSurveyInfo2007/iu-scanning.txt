Mine,

We are doing internal scanning for vulnerabilities every 4 weeks on all of our 
servers whether they are running critical services or not. Details can be 
found at https://itso.iu.edu/scanner/. We were alerted to some apache 
configuration vulnerabilities this weekend on a development server, so 
this process is working and we are getting notifications. It uses Internet 
Scanner from Internet Security Systems (ISS).

Please let me know if you need more information,
Rob
