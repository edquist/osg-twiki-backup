Hi,
let me know if this is what you are looking for.
Cheers

ReSS runs on Scientific Linux Fermi LTS release 4.4 (Wilson) (kernel 2.6.9-55.0.2.ELsmp). 
It uses apache (2.0.58), tomcat (5.0.28), and condor (6.8.5 May 17 2007). Administrative access to the 
service is limited to ReSS developers and FermiGrid employees via kerberized ssh.

IU institutional backups are done nightly, redundant services are located at IU and IUPUI. Read and write access is granted through Footprints accounts. SSH, Web, and FP accounts are monitored by Nagios.

Physical controls:
Ress machine is located in FCC2 -- card access
console level access : anybody can access if they can enter the room. no bios password or grub password

network level access: fermilab kerberos principal -- gabriele, fermigrid people, tanya
there is no need for data retention or back up. data is provided from cemon .
this is dedicated to ReSS --runs minimum set of services.
no backup plan.
end user cannot talk to ress directly. end user only talks to condor. cemon collect cluster data and sends to ress. ress formats the data and sends to condor.
condor no auth/authZ for end user
