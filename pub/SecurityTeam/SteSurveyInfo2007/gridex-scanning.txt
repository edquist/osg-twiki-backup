Here are the answers, as best I can quickly assemble, to your
last few sets of questions about the Grid Exerciser.


Configuration management:

I don't believe any of the components belong to the OSG.  I may
be misunderstanding the quesiton.

> > 2. How are the components configured?

The Grid Exerciser is configured through a configuration file
listing sites to be tested as well as scripts specifying command
line options.

There are no formalized procedures.  All changes are routed
through me, Alan De Smet.



Security:

The machine is in a locked room.

Yes, via SSH.

The machine is running services that are unnecessary to the Grid
Exerciser's operation.  The machine runs a standardized
installation used Linux computers in the UW CS department, and
thus runs standard services including, but not limited to, an
SMTP server and monitoring services.

The service does not accept network connections or otherwise
allow access or user submitted requests.

The necessary components and versions are not documented.  The
steps to re-build the service are not documented.


Network Scanning:

For the network scanning questions, I'm assuming the context is
scanning the Grid Exerciser to check that it is up or for
vulnerabilities.  As the Grid Exerciser doesn't present any
network interface, I believe the questions are generally
not-applicable.

> > 1. What type of network scanning is being done?

None.  The Grid Exerciser does not accept network connections, so
there is nothing to scan.

> > 2. How often?

Never.  The Grid Exerciser does not accept network connections, so
there is nothing to scan.

> > 3. Are there established remedial procedures when
> >    vulnerabilities are detected?

No.  The Grid Exerciser does not accept network connections, so
there is nothing to scan.
