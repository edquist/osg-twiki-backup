this is a pretty good start. My remaining question is : if there are any special installation or build instructions for any of the core services? 
the security plan asks that we must record the installation instructions for each service in case we need to build any of them

Re: Missing service configurations
From:
Rob Quick <rquick@iupui.edu>

Gabriele and Philippe,

Can you put together a quick overview of the configurations Gratia and ReSS are running on? See the examples below, it is just very base configuration for your servers.

Mine,

MIS and GridEx are VOs, iVDGL and fMRI and OSG EDU are run by GOC VOMS
The ITB and Production Caches are the same as the web pages. Mine asked Rob on 10/25 -- same as software caches not web pages 
And the Development service is no longer used.

Rob said all of his core service systems are under two levels of key card access. Mine from 11/9/2007

So I think that leaves, MonaLisa, gratia, ReSS, RSV, and the ticketing system.

MonALISA runs on Gentoo (Kernel 2.6.17.2) using apache (2.0.58), tomcat (5.0.28) and MonALISA (1.2.12).
 IU Institutional backups are done nightly. Read access to web is open, write is restricted to GOC employees. 
SSH, Web, and Tomcat are monitored by Nagios.   

Footprints Ticketing runs on RedHat Enterprise 5 (Kernel 2.6.18-8.1.6.el5) and uses apache (2.0.58) and Footprints (7.0d3). 
IU institutional backups are done nightly, redundant services are located at IU and IUPUI. Read and write access is granted through Footprints accounts.
 SSH, Web, and FP accounts are monitored by Nagios.

RSV is running on Scientific Linux 3 (Kernel 2.4.21-40.ELsmp) and uses the gratia collector (0.27.5). At this point backups and monitoring are
 not being done, but they will start with the release of 0.8.0 on November 1. All access is limited to GOC employees.

Let me know if you need anything else,
Rob

Mine, you are correct, we limit network access to the ports needed to run and maintain the services.

RSV will have web access eventually, but probably not until OSG 1.0.0, now it is limited to GOC personnel and developers. As for trouble tickets access is limited to consortium members who apply for an account (this consists of letting us know you want on, and now a training ppt.). There is a passphrase control for the ticketing system.

I think I did one of these, but will work on the rest this afternoon.
