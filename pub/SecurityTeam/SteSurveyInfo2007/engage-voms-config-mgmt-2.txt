The server is in the RENCI machine room. The cage is 
unlocked, but we are only a small number of people who 
have access to the machine room. Access is controlled with cardkeys.

I'm the only one who has login access.

I'm not a VOMS expert, but I think it will allow anyone with a 
valid credential from the trusted CAs to get a VO membership list. 
This is how the resources sites query the VOMS and update gridmap 
files every night.

VOMS is the only third party service on the machine. The other 
services are ssh, smtp, and snmp (all firewalled to be only 
available from a select few RENCI hosts).
