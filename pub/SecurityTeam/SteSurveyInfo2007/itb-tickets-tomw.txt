Apache, Mysql, RT. RT is version 3.4, the versions of Apache and Mysql I
need to check.

Jason, do we have this? I did not write an installation manual.

The machine is in our computer center, the access required BNL ID bbadge
with access permit.

There is no consoly, you can atatch a monitor and keyboard and then
logon as root.

Oncly via ssh using private key. Jason can you elaborate?

I think so, but I need to check.

No there is only one server. Jason, do we have plans for a second one?

Logs: So far we keep the indefinitely, we have not reached the point
when we have to decide what to do with old logs.

Backups: we do have a daily backup, I do not remember how long it is
kept. few months at least, I believe.

Depends what you mean by users. Anybody can submit tickets by e-mail.
The e-mail must pass our anti virus and anti spam checks. 

In order to logon to RT wwww interface users need to have account and
password. 

Only RT admin can logon to the RT machine itself.

As I said, anybody can submit tickets via e-mail provided that the e-
mail passes spam and virus filters. Submiting tickets does not mean that
you can other tickets or you can logon to the service.

Jason can say more.
