So, my question is who is knowledgable on configuring, building taking care of this service ? I have bunch of questions to ask that person for documentation purposes.

Mine,

The OSG ST&E tool is hosted/run on fermigrid2.fnal.gov.  As such, it's
backup is "covered" by the fermigrid2 backups into TiBS.

You should contact Steve Timm for the precise details of when and how
often the backups are performed, where the TiBS tapes are stored, and
how long they are retained.
