It is in the FCC Computer room, which is locked and requires special access.

The machine uses kerberos authentication.  Only root administrators or members of the docdb group may access it with a valid Kerberos ticket.

Yes.

Yes, with Kerberos authentication.

Marcia,
Here is configuration details regarding docdb server:

6) do you know the components of the server ? for example apache, ssl versions, mysql anything else ? do you have installation instructions to configure these components.
if not, can you please write down their versions and if they need any special configuration variables -- are you using them out of the box

[root@www-docdb bin]# rpm -qa | grep -i httpd
httpd-2.0.46-68.sl3

[root@www-docdb bin]# rpm -qa | grep -i ssl
mod_ssl-2.0.46-68.sl3

[root@www-docdb bin]# rpm -qa | grep -i mysql
mysql-server-3.23.58-15.RHEL3.1
