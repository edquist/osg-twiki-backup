1) is the machien that contains listserv server under any physical lock or protection ?


Computer room, card reader access


2) what is the console access to that machine? can anyone access the machine? what are the access controls for the admins to the machine


system administrators can access the console.



3) are you running the minimum network services required for listserv funtionality ?



Yes



4) if you allow over the network access, do you use ssl ?



This depends. Web access for list administration uses SSL with a recognized CA certificate. RDP access for system administration uses Windows High Encryption.




5) do you have bakcup machines to run listserv if the current instance
gets

crashed ? what is your plan for service continuation ?


At this time we do not have a spare system dedicated to listserv backup. A system problem requiring restoration from backup or repair would be handled via our established procedures for system restoration.





6) do you know the components of the server ? for example apache, ssl

versions, mysql anything else ? do you have installation instructions
to

configure these components.





if not, can you please write down their versions and if they need any

special configuration variables -- are you using them out of the box




Listserv runs on Windows Server 2003 sp1 with IIS6. The list software itself is

LISTSERV(R) for Windows version 14.5

It is a out of the box configuration.
