OSG VO
configuration is documented. dan yocum documented -- it will be in docdb (cd) soon. 
VOMS and VOMRS two separate machines.
physical -- in fcc1
console: bios password and grub passwd
network level : fermi principal with admin privileges
dedicated and VOMS runs minimum network services necessary, VOMRS + a few other services.
backup: fermigrid minor application
data retention: system and service logs backed up every night and kept 30 days
VOMS/R you need DOE certs for auth. no authz.

Hi Doug,

We (the OSG VO) do not yet have anything formal written down on this subject as yet but I can tell you that the OSG VOMS and VOMRS servers are run by Fermilab by agreement with the OSG. I do not believe that the OSG "owns" even the server instance in the way that I think you mean. I have cc'd Chander and Ruth for further comment on this. All technical questions regarding configuration and configuration management should be directed to the FNAL support center and the answers will be the same (I believe) for all VOs run by fermilab, with the distinction that this VOMS instance appears in the opensciencegrid.org domain rather than the fnal.gov domain.

I have cc'd this to Keith Chadwick, the Fermigrid Group Leader, who can comment if he thinks appropriate (although I think he's at HEPiX this week).

Thanks,
Chris.
