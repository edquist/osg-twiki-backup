Subject: D0 finished with reprocessing of data



 Dear OSG members,

 I would like to let you know that D0 is essentially finished with its 
 reprocessing of data.  We have a handful of merging to do but this is
 small.  Due to issues with making sure we do not duplicate jobs it
 may be a week or two before we are completely done, but we have 
 less than 1% of the data to merge.

 I wanted to thank to thank the OSG sites and members
 for all of their hard work. D0 could never have
 been able to reprocess its data without your resources and your help
 in tracking down and fixing problems.
 Of the ~445 million events that were reprocessed, over
 ~286 million events were done on OSG sites
 ~16 million events were done on LCG sites
 ~145 million events on native SAM grid sites

 Numbers are not exact since the accounting I have access to is
 only accurate to ~ 5%

 The OSG sites each reprocessed the following number of events.

 OSCER: ~25 million
 SPRACE: ~ 19 million
 UFL1: ~ 53 million
 IU/ATLAS: 11 million
 LONI: ~ 49 million
 IU: ~ 10 million
 UNL: ~ 30 million
 UCSD: ~ 29 million
 Wisconsin: ~ 26 million
 UFL2: ~26 million

 So we had major contributions from many sites.  

 The CMS and fermi gp farms were crucial as they were used
 extensively for merging of all of the events processed on
 OSG.

 Due to unseen difficulties, the start of the reprocessing was delayed
 which caused a delay in our schedule.  However, we were still able to
 get the necessary OSG resources to finish the work.  It was very much
 appreciated that you were able to continue to provide resources beyond
 the agreed upon dates. 

 Soon we will be using fermi-grid for our primary processing of data.
 Many of the lessons learned from the reprocessing effort are being
 implemented for the primary processing so we are continuing to reap
 the benefits of using OSG for our reprocessing.
 We are ramping up our MC efforts on OSG now that the reprocessing
 is finished.  

 So again on behalf of the D0 experiment, I would like to give 
 a big Thank You to OSG for all of your help and support during
 the past few months.

 Cheers,
 Brad
