Survey for OSG storage administrators
*************************************

1. We are interested in understanding and addressing the storage
needs at sites in OSG. What are your unmet storage needs? What
problems are you experiencing?



2. How do you upgrade/install your storage software: from VDT or  directly
from  software native site (e.g. http://www.dcache.org or http://datagrid.lbl.gov/bestman)? If you are using VDT installation what do you think is needed to  improve the process? If you are not using it
then why?


3. We are  considering having a meeting for OSG storage administrators,
focused  just on storage (that is, not a general site administration meeting)
The goal would be for us to better know your needs, and to share
experience between storage administrators, OSG Storage group and storage
experts. Would you find this useful? We have a draft list of topics--would you add or
remove anything from this list?"
