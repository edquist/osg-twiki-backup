Minutes of storage meeting: 3rd August 2005
------------------------------------------
Attendees: Surya, Kevin McCord, Paul Sheldon, Jorge, Eric

----------------------------
(1) Wish List for Super Computing 2005 (Paul Sheldon)

a)Data Visualization (See (3)

b)Bandwidth Challenge

SC2004 Data as a Metric was used,Grid FTP Demo, Netlogger Demo

c)Integerating a SE and CE element: UCSD has succeeded, in integerating a CE and SE in an implicit way.

d)Interoperabililty between various Storage Elements (SRM-Dcache, DRM, LStore, ....)

e)Supercomputing Presentations


----------------------------
(2) L-Store Update (Paul Sheldon)

Surya: We have a basic version of lstcp command that works with software agents and IBP as the protocol

We are going to start working on Interoperability with GridFTP


----------------------------
(3) Miscellanious

Paul raised Super computing Data visualization issues, Eric was explaining the solutions they use for the Star Project.

Essentialy it may be interesting to visualy show the amount of data being moved.Jorge Suggested that there may be applications

that already catalogues the data movemenet (CMS/ATLAS) for example already may have applications.

Mark Greens group at Buffalo may have a graphing application.Paul suggested activiely pursuing MArk Greens Monitoring Group


Jorge: OSG Monitoring: Monalisa Plots, MD VO (VO DATA),Essentialy

Abhishek: Fermi has lot of data archiving tools but will probably built only for srm-dcache/DRM

Paul: Grid Cat can be another example of an application.

Common Wish List:

1. Bytes in and out
2. VO Level view of Data Movement


----------------------------
(4) J-Lab Meeting

Touch bases while there.Decide on an agenda.
